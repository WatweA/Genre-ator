High HopesPanic! At The Disco,"[Intro]
High, high hopes

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Verse 2]
Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

[Bridge]
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

[Bridge]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)"
NaturalImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

Brokenlovelytheband,"[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 1]
I met you late night, at a party
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off

[Pre-Chorus]
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 2]
There's something tragic, but almost pure
Think I could love you, but I'm not sure
There's something wholesome, there's something sweet
Tucked in your eyes that I'd love to meet

[Pre-Chorus]
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Bridge]
Life is not a love song that we like
We're all broken pieces floating by
Life is not a love song we can try
To fix our broken pieces one at a time

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you"
Bohemian RhapsodyQueen,"[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low

Without you, when you're gone

Under PressureQueen,"[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

[Chorus: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""Let me out!""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor

Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Bridge: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3: Freddie Mercury]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro: David Bowie]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure

You're Somebody Elseflora cash,"[Verse 1: Cole Randall]
I saw the part of you
That only when you're older, you will see too
You will see too
I held the better cards
But every stroke of luck has gotta bleed through
It's gotta bleed through

That only blindly I could read you
But I could read you

Go forward slowly
It's not a race to the end

All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again
And I know you claim that you're alright

But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again

Discover some new truth

Well I know I had it all on the line
But don’t just sit with folded hands and become blind

Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in

Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)

Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

ZeroImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely

Love It If We Made ItThe 1975,"[Verse 1]
We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made them laugh, you made them cry

A backdrop for the girls and boys

Are you ready?
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

[Verse 1]
Well, are you ready now for the revolution?
For too long your power has been taken away, it's been taken away
Does your heart feel heavy now? Savor the solution
Take those mental shackles off and throw them away
You've got to get them out of your mind
Don't you let their vision leave you blind

[Verse 2]
Moving steady now, it's a revelation
For so long your focus has been taken away, now you're breaking away
They may think they know you, but here's an education
No, they can't control you once you've broken away
They're done patrolling your mind
When they're searching for you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for

[Chorus]
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon

[Verse 3]
That's enough already now, you don't wanna take it
All your reservations have been taken away, they've been taken away
So you think you're ready now for the revolution?
Yeah, they can't control you once you've broken away
You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for

[Chorus]
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?

You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you, they will find

Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for us to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for us to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
Let me know you're ready to be turned into people who cannot be preyed upon

[Chorus]
Are you ready?

We cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?

Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like

I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?

I love them, I love them
These are my friends, these are my friends
I love them, I love them

[Verse 1]
I wish I was a little more loved
Tryna find a way to fix that
So many people inside my head
Momma taught me not to talk back
But they're pretty good company
They cheer me up when I feel bad
Is it my insecurities
That keep me going?

MantraBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell ""epiphany""?

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

[Bridge]
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

Now those days are over
And we are all ghosts

We used to sleep all day and talk all night
Stay up by the TV light (Oh, oh)
When your baby teeth ain't milky white
Wipe the stardust from your eyes (Oh, oh)

All Out LifeSlipknot,"[Verse 1]
What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

[Chorus]
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

[Verse 2]
Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I gotta know now, you better tell me

[Chorus]
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

[Bridge]
We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
""I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever""

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die

MovementHozier,"[Verse 1]
I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

[Verse 2]
You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose

Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove

Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally

Cause I don't know it
Whenever I can, I hurt myself


And I don't want to feel that way
I don't want to go out and play
I don't know for how long I'll stay
I am lost and I need to find my place

I am just running
To find my way home
Where is my home?
I cannot find it
Where is my home?
Because every mistake I make takes me away from my home

I can't see anything, I am falling
Pushing myself as hard as I can and keep on falling

And I don't want to feel that way
I don't want to go out, and play
I don't know for how long I'll stay
I am lost and I need to find my place

I am just running

Because every mistake I make takes me away from my home
Im so tired of excuses, they are taking me away from my home"
Radio Ga Ga (Live Aid)Queen,"[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

On videos for hours and hours

Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes

All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

Got a 20-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat

Oh, I'll try to get a job in a bank, I think
Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
I feel sick and I know I that I'll lose but
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not living if it's not with you)
(It's not, it's not)

Fast TalkHouses,"[Verse 1]
Me and my best friends cruising down West End Street
Hiding from cops and driving circles around the block all week
All of my friends died out on West End Street
They say we're born to die young
But we're just trying to live in peace

[Chorus]
So maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk
So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run

[Verse 2]
All of our friends went crazy on LSD
Sailing their cars through the big bright city streets
And everyone who knows our name
Says that we ain't ever gonna change
They say we're born to die young
But we're trying to find a better way
They say we're born to die young
But we're trying to find a better way

[Chorus]
Maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk
So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run

[Spoken]
Word up?
Hey, what's up, man?
Just sitting around and I'm gonna be 32 years old tomorrow
And I feel half completely alive and half completely dead

[Bridge]
We hope and we pray day after day
They say we're born to die young
But we're gonna find a better way
We hope and we pray day after day
They say we're born to die young
But we're trying to find a better way

[Chorus]
So maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk
So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run"
DiseaseBeartooth,"[Intro]
If I fall again, will it be the end?
I know it's wrong, you think I'm strong, but I just pretend
Is it takin' over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Stuck at the surface, not makin' progress
Fallin' apart, well, I'm tryin' my hardest
Lookin' for answers, findin' a rope
Is the noose gettin' tighter? I'm losin' control

[Pre-Chorus]
Will the end make me whole again?

[Chorus]
It's like holdin' on when my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

[Verse 2]
I'm gettin' older, still, lost as ever
Fakin' a smile while I bury the pressure
Why does this happen? I should be fine
But I can't shake the feelin', I'm livin' a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Will the end make me whole again?

[Chorus]
It's like holdin' on when my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

Roaring 20sPanic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Verse 2]
Oscars and Emmys and Grammys
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Bridge]
Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feeling me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Oh-woah

Here comes the Sunday driver
Came to get my sister
We know you're such a liar
Can't believe I missed her

[Chorus]
It ain't right (Yeah)
It ain't wrong
It's a fact
Sing my song

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know he's gonna spin it
Can't believe she kissed him
He said, ""Give me just a minute
I'm working on a system""

It ain't right (Woo)
It ain't wrong
It's a fact, yeah
Sing my song

It ain't right (Woo)
It ain't wrong
It's a fact
Sing my song

Northern LightsDeath Cab For Cutie,"[Verse 1: Benjamin Gibbard]
I remember your silhouette on Dyes Inlet
Against the silver sheen of a moon like painted glass
Under stars out on a pier; a celestial sphere
We were weightless as the waves that disappeared

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard]
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

[Verse 2: Benjamin Gibbard with Lauren Mayberry]
We shared a clove cigarette on the parapet
As the TVs glowed from the windows of the model homes
And I'd never be that close again to your lips and perfect skin
As the tide receded into the unknown

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard & Lauren Mayberry]
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

[Post-Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard]
I remember your silhouette on Dyes Inlet

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard & Lauren Mayberry]
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized"
Almost (Sweet Music)Hozier,"[Verse 1]
I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is ""Stella by Starlight""
That was my heart, the drums that start off ""Night and Day""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Verse 2]
Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Bridge]
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't, mmm
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

[Verse 3]
The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, ""Is everything alright?""
And, Lord

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me"
Come AlongCosmo Sheldrake,"[Verse 1]
Come along, catch a Heffalump
Sit with me on a muddy clump
We'll sing a song of days gone by
Run along now, don’t be glum
Get you gone, now, have some fun
Don't be long, for the end is nigh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't let moments pass along
And waste before your eyes
March with me and the borogoves
Come with me and the slithy toves
And never ask us why

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

[Bridge]
We'll be here when the world slows down
And the sunbeams fade away
Keeping time by a pendulum
As the fabric starts to fray
There’s no such thing as time to kill
Nor time to throw away
So, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty
Thrice for another day

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

[Verse 2]
Come with me, catch a rare type specimen
Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton
We'll break our fast with friends
Once we're fed, we shall disappear rapidly
Many moons to the west of here and happily
Our journey never ends

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shut your ears when sirens sing,
Tie armbands to your feet
Listen up and you won't go wrong again
Float along on a verse-less song and then
Get to where the two ends meet

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs"
Land Of The FreeThe Killers,"[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers & Choir]
Can't wipe the wind-blown smile from across my face
It's just the old man in me
Washing his truck at the Sinclair station
In the land of the free (Ooh)
His mother, Adeline's family, came on a ship
Cut coal and planted a seed
Down in them drift mines of Pennsylvania
In the land of the free

[Chorus: Choir & Brandon Flowers]
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
(I'm standing crying)

[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers & Choir]
When I go out in my car, I don't think twice
But if you're the wrong color skin (I'm standing, crying)
You grow up looking over both your shoulders
In the land of the free
And we got more people locked up than the rest of the world
Right here in red, white and blue (I'm standing, crying)
Incarceration's become big business
It's harvest time out on the avenue

[Chorus: Choir & Brandon Flowers]
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Move on there's nothing to see
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free

[Bridge: Choir]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm standing, crying (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm standing, crying

[Verse 3: Brandon Flowers & Choir]
So how many daughters, tell me, how many sons
Do we have to have to put in the ground
Before we just break down and face it:
We got a problem with guns? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
In the land of the free
Down at the border, they're gonna put up a wall
Concrete and Rebar Steel beams (I'm standing, crying)
High enough to keep all those filthy hands off
Of our hopes and our dreams (I'm standing, crying)
People who just want the same things we do
In the land of the free

[Chorus: Choir & Brandon Flowers]
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free (I'm standing, crying)"
HurtOliver Tree,"[Intro]
My day will come, I gave too much
I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I only want your dying love, I've seen enough

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

[Verse 1]
I feel left out, I don't see how
My whole life can change in one week
I don't mind my own reflection
I don't see how, you've been let down
Don't speak 'less you have to
Why you always seem in a bad mood?
Your whole life, you had an attitude
One day, is it so bad for you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

[Verse 2]
I changed my whole life when
I learned to ignore them
I changed my whole life up
Maybe it was not enough
I don't think I'm allowed to
Make a deal with your selfish ways
They're acting vicious out there
There's lots of demons out here

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough"
Who Do You Trust?Papa Roach,"[Verse 1]

Never turn my back to the vultures

Tell me who do you trust? What?

Ten times outta nine, I'm a hand grenade
I don’t wanna push you away, but I'm warning you, babe
This ain't a green light, no serenade
It’s a red flag before the mayday
Check all of my signs, keep away, I'm warning you, babe

Afraid to light the fuse again; start a fire, lose a friend

Harmony HallVampire Weekend,"[Verse 1]
We took a vow in summertime
Now we find ourselves in late December
I believe that New Year's Eve
Will be the perfect time for their great surrender
But they don't remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

[Chorus]
And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Verse 2]
Within the halls of power lies a nervous heart that beats
Like a Young Pretender's
Beneath these velvet gloves I hide
The shameful, crooked hands of a moneylender
'Cause I still remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified

Over My HeadJudah,"[Verse 1]
What's my purpose? Huh? What's my future? I don't know
These are the questions I address before I go to sleep
I wish my mind would turn off with the lights and my TV screen
But here in the dark, everything off, I start to think
It gets hard to breathe

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
All these thoughts are an ocean that I'm drowning in
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head

[Verse 2]
Second guessing, I'm so stressed, success is an empty lie
So what's the point if that's our purpose on Earth by design?
All this stressing got me confessing that I can't find peace
Well, I hydrate, caffeinate, medicate, repeat
I hydrate, caffeinate, medicate, repeat, I

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head

I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
All these thoughts are an ocean I'm drowning in
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head

I'm in over my head

I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head

medicineBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
You rained on my heart for far too long (Far too long)
Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause
I can't save you from yourself
When all you give a shit about is everybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

[Chorus]
You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit

[Verse 2]
Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
And I spent too long in a place I don't belong

But you won't admit, why don't you get a grip?
'Cause you can't keep going on and on and on and on like this
And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit

'Cause I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
Yeah, I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud

And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

CringeMatt Maeson,"[Verse 1]
Lover, come over, look what I've done
I've been alone so long, I feel like I'm on the run
Lover, come over, kick up the dust
I've got a secret starting to rust

[Chorus]
She said I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, ""I'm just tired,"" she said, ""You're just high""
And I said, ""I saw you in the water""
And I said, ""I saw you in the water""

Lover, come hold me, head's on the fritz
Gaudy intoxicated feelings comfortably mixed
Lover, come hold me, could you forget?
I've got a secret, digging a debt

She said I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, ""I'm just tired,"" she said, ""You're just high""
And I said, ""I saw you in the water""
And I said, ""I saw you in the water""

Sweating all your sins out
Putting all your thoughts back together
Oh, we just don't blend now
All of my attempts seem to weather
Oh, I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?
Oh, I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?

She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, ""I'm just tired,"" she said, ""You're just high""

First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been-oh, ooh
The way that things have been-oh, ooh
Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea-oh, ooh
The master of my sea-oh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I was broken from a young age
Takin' my sulkin' to the masses
Writin' my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
Singin' from heartache from the pain
Takin' my message from the veins
Speakin' my lesson from the brain
Seein' the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

First things first, can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin''
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
Love you Miss Cita, the son of a leader
I know that bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without, huh
Hold up, hold up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without gain
I know that beauty don't come without
Don't come without…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge: Dan Reynolds]
Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

Go ahead and tell me you got all you want
Fiver says you're wrong

Move things along

And we lapped it up and we’re wise enough to know
How it goes, forgive me, honey
But we’re wise enough to know
How it goes, forgive me, honey
‘Cause we know this feeling all a little too well

[Chorus]
Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine

As if one of our longshots paid off
One of our longshots paid off

So yeah, go ahead and tell me something real
Come on, how'd you feel?
And I suppose you've come down to help me
Add scenes to the reel, to the reel

How it goes, forgive me, honey

Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of our longshots paid off
One of our longshots paid off

[Bridge]
And it's by the by
If it makes those nights fly
We're side by side again
And now, we’re all careless and love drunk
You know exactly how it goes
When you’re giving us all kind of reason
Thought I had to go and follow the heart I believe in
'Cause one of us must know
When you're giving us all kind of reason
Thought I had to go and follow the heart I believe in
'Cause in the past it's done me good
So good, so good, so good

[Chorus]
Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of our longshots paid off
Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of our longshots paid off
One of our longshots paid off

Whoa, lift me higher
Whoa, when I get down
Whoa, lift me higher
Whoa

I swear to God that it might just be the death of me
Just count the reasons why I'm crazy, yeah, it's stressing me
I'm burning pictures of myself like it could set me free
But I can't stop because I gotta reach my destiny, like hey, whoa
I was dead, now I'm living because I made my decision
No, I will not be a victim, and I'm like ""Hey, whoa""
No, I don't need permission to elevate with precision
I'm 'bout to break through the ceiling

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I need something to lift me up when I'm down

'Cause I can't take another second, watch me elevate, like hey, whoa
Yeah, I'm taking this vision, my God, body has risen
No, I can't stop with this rhythm, and I'm like ""Hey, whoa""
No, my mind ain't a prison, I won't succumb to these villains
They keep attacking my feelings

still feel.half alive,"[Verse 1]
When I'm furthest from myself (Far away)
Feeling closer to the stars (Outer space)
I've been invaded by the dark (Can't escape)
Trying to recognize myself when I feel I've been replaced
When I'm furthest from myself (Far away)
Feeling closer to the stars (Outer space)
I've been invaded by the dark (Can't escape)
Trying to recognize myself when I feel I've been replaced

I can feel a kick down in my soul
And it's pulling me back to Earth to let me know
I am not a slave, can't be contained
So pick me from the dark and pull me from the grave 'cause

I still feel alive
When it is hopeless, I start to notice
And I still feel alive
Falling forward, back into orbit

So, when I lose my gravity in this sleepy womb
Drifting as I dream, I'll wake up soon
To realize the hand of life is reaching out
To rid me of my pride, I call allegiance to myself

But I can feel a kick down in my soul
And it's pulling me back to Earth to let me know
I am not a slave, can't be contained
So pick me from the dark and pull me from the grave

I still feel alive
When it is hopeless, I start to notice
And I still feel alive
Falling forward, back into orbit
Oh, I still feel alive
It is hopeless, I start to notice
Oh, I still feel alive
Falling forward, back into orbit

I can feel a kick down in my soul
And it's pulling me back to Earth to let me know
And this heart that beats inside of me will show
It will show

[Bridge]
Floating in outer space, have I misplaced a part of my soul?
Lost in the in-between, or so it seems, I'm out of control
Floating in outer space, have I misplaced a part of my soul?
Lost in the in-between, but it can't keep me asleep for long, 'cause

[Chorus]
I still feel alive (I can feel it)
When it is hopeless (It ain't hopeless)
I start to notice (Start to notice)
And I still feel alive (I can feel it)
Falling forward (Falling forward)
Back into orbit (Back into orbit)
Oh, I still feel alive (I can feel it)
When it is hopeless (It ain't hopeless)
I start to notice (Start to notice)
Oh, I still feel alive (I can feel it)
Falling forward (Falling forward)
Back into orbit (Yeah)

I still feel alive (I can feel it)
It ain't hopeless
I start to notice
I still feel alive (I can feel it)
Falling forward (Yeah)

You're the fuckin' acid to my alkaline
You run your middle finger up and down my spine
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize
I'm so fuckin' sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick
And now I'm sick, throwing fits
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fuckin' day since I left
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head
And I'm down and depressed
All I want is your head on my chest
Touchin' feet in my bed

Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts

[Chorus]
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

[Verse 2]
You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
You gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared

[Chorus]
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them"
We Are The Champions (Live Aid)Queen,"[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...
Of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...

We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...

Hammer To Fall (Live Aid)Queen,"[Intro]
Hey hey hey hey, ""Hammer to Fall""!

[Verse 1]
Here we stand or here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won’t be home tonight

[Chorus]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all, yeah
And it’s time for the hammer to fall

[Verse 2]
Every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build up...

[Chorus]
Tow your line and play their game
'Til the anesthetic covers it all
'Til one day they call your name
Then it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same (Oh no, oh no)
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, now your struggle's all in vain, oh, yeah

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Just wanna  scream it louder and louder and louder

[Chorus]
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
Then it’s time for the hammer to, hammer to fall

[Guitar Solo]

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
One more time
Waiting for the hammer to fall

Give it to me one more time!"
New HouseRex Orange County,"[Verse 1]
It doesn't come that easy anyway
Every time I try, it never feels the way it did at the start
This one for my dawgs
That see where I’m coming from and know why it's hard
I do it for you
No one can save me this evening
She does her all but I've never been the easiest ride
She says, ""It’s okay, we know it's alright""
(So I sit, picture it)

[Chorus]
I can see us in a house next year
(You'll be) making your mind up
You can figure out what goes where
(And stay) keeping it real with me all the time
All the while, they can't touch me anyway
So I'll be holding it down with you every day

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, yeah)
Holding it down (Oh)
Oh, oh, I'll be holding it down
Holding it down (Yeah)
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm so good at falling asleep
Grateful for you waking me
If it weren't for you, I would’ve stayed here for weeks
And the bed is just upstairs, the only place I feel peace
There’s nothing I forgot to do
Nowhere that I'ma need to be
There’s no one left for me to impress
How am I meant to know what's good
When nothing good on the screen?
It's been the same way for a while now and I'ma come clean
You know that I haven’t been inspired since like I was 18
And the extra stress isn't necessary anyway
So the only thing that's worrying is right in front of me in a line
And life is too short to be staying inside
But I didn't realize I ran from the light
And no one can save me, I'm bleeding
I do my best, but I rarely am a regular guy
At least I've got 3-6-4 more days to get it right
(Take a seat, picture this)

[Chorus]
I can see us in a house next year
You'll be making your mind up
You can figure out what goes where
You'll be keeping it real with me all the time

[Verse 3]
No distraction, no one's even tryna reach me
Well, not until they need something, honestly
And the trouble is
Everybody needs something all the fuckin' time (Time)
Everybody needs something all the fuckin' time
Oh yeah

[Outro]
It doesn't happen like this every day
Every time I look at her, I feel the way I did at the start
She's holding me up, I'll never depart
All the emotions straight from the heart
She got me all in my feelings
I wouldn't know how to live life if it wasn't with her
I know what it's worth"

Did I count the days wrong?
Did we just go 'round and 'round
All the way to step one?

They would ask me all the time
Every time the show's up
""So what you doin' with your life?""

Home Sweet HomeMotley Crue,"[Verse 1]
You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this
Long and winding road

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

Too many romantic dreams
Up in lights
Falling off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together
At the seams

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free

BelovedMumford,"[Verse 1]
Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper darling close the door
Well, how have I not made a note of every word
You ever said
And time is not on our side but I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

[Chorus]
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you

[Verse 2]
Are you afraid
However could you not be
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

[Chorus]
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved

[Bridge]
We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love

[Chorus]
And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet"
A Reason To FightDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
The image in your eyes
Reflecting the pain that has taken you
I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
From what's ailing you

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you can rise again
So don't give up

[Chorus]
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

[Verse 2]
Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through?

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you will rise again
I won't give up

[Chorus]
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

[Bridge]
Don't let it take your soul
Look at me, take control
We're going to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for

[Interlude]
Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win

[Chorus]
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

[Outro]
I'll be your reason to fight
Give you a reason to fight"

Are You Bored Yet?Wallows,"[Verse 1: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
What's wrong?
You've been asking but I don't have an answer
How come?
I'm still thinking, let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old, will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that shit
And stalling only goes so far when you've got a head start

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking, ""Are you bored yet?""
And if you're feeling lonely you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?

[Verse 2: Clairo]
Feels like I've known you my whole life
I can see right through your lies
I don't know where we're going
But I'd like to be by your side
If you could tell me how you're feeling
Maybe we'd get through this undefeated
Holding on for so long

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking, ""Are you bored yet?""
And if you're feeling lonely you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?"

Breaking DownI Prevail,"[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]

Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I’m breaking down

Person in the mirror, they won't let me feel a thing
Keep me focused on my problems, I'm addicted to the pain
Everybody's out to get you

My enemy emotion, but I can't sink or swim

Only as alone as I want to be
Passing all the people standing on the street

A crystal ball and the odyssey

High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most

The ones who'd been gone for so very long
She couldn't remember their names
They spun her around on the damp old stone
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

Through the snow that swept through the hall
From winter to summer and winter again

Down to the ground
It struck me down, struck me down
Struck me down to the ground

Wondering 'bout where do we go
Until then, we boat

Take some of these, they'll ease the pain
Live fast, die young, pay the price
The best die young, immortalized

Starry-eyed children left behind
To choose their favorite vice
I don't have the strength to think twice

Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
People always say, ""Man, at least you're on the radio""

[Post-Chorus]
At least you're on the radio, oh
At least you're on the radio, huh

Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer

Night RunningCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1: Beck]
We're on a night run
Boy you better hold your tongue
Talking like you're coming from kingdom come
Rhythm and reeling, the feeling I'm riding
The sound through the ceiling
Never got no money
But I'm running from the gun
My engines flooded
Cold blooded no money
Drunk on something, uh
Killing the moonlight with daylight
I got my X-ray eyes
And I'm feeling so fine

[Chorus]
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
We're running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, all night running (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, we're all night running (We roll)

[Verse 2: Matt Shultz]
We're on the nightshade
Tell me what we're hiding from
Like someone could steal it
Are we waiting for some kind of feeling
Or saving it up for the morning?
Undercover
The cloak and dagger
Is there a creature in the attic?
Are we for real, yeah?
Or just pretending?
Will it burn out by the morning?

[Chorus]
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
We're running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, all night running (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, we're all night running (We roll)

[Verse 3: Beck and Matt Shultz]
We're on a night run
No telling who we're running from
In a world of secrets and demons and people hiding from the sun
Sending my message to everyone losing control
Better not stop 'til I get home
Sentimental flowers don't grow
Got to live through tidal waves
And parishes and biblical floods
I got the gris-gris love
And the streets in my blood
I'm on the final run
Falling in and out of love, oh

[Chorus]
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
We're running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, all night running (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, we're all night running (We roll)"

I, I've been keeping secrets from you dear
There's things in me I'm scared that you might fear

And you, you've been coming closer to the edge
Wondering what goes on in my head
And so I shut you out

Remember WhenBad Wolves,"[Verse 1]
Remember when, when it was 1992
Two little kids stealing records, skipping school
We must have been like only ten
Taking life for granted till we learn it had an end
Remember when, and time is something they say
You never appreciate till you age
And to this day you never knew
I wanted to be just like you

[Chorus]
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now

[Verse 2]
Remember when, when it was 2002
You started slinging coke and got the dopest pair of shoes
But, yo, this house just ain't a home
Since our father hit the bottle and our mother hit the road
And time is something they say
You never understand until it slips away
And looking back I think you knew
I wanted to be just like you

[Chorus]
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now

[Post-Chorus]
And now I'm tired of the violence, I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you
Now I'm tired of the violence, I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you

Slipping and we're falling through ice
Slipping and we're falling

If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now

And it's better me, better me than you
Now I'm tired of the violence, I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you

Remember when
Slipping and we're falling
Slipping and we're falling through ice
Slipping and we're falling

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 1]
I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

[Bridge]
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

The streets are bare, there's no one there, and the valley is wide
There comes a time, two hearts of gold
Leave together, run forever on the open road

[Chorus]
They gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
They gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
In the winter time, when the day is long
You're halfway there, the field is bare, and the fire is gone
Are you all alone? Are you feeling cold?
Find your flame, call her name, and hit the road

[Chorus]
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh"
This LifeVampire Weekend,"[Verse 1]
Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain
I just thought it didn't rain in California
Baby, I know love isn't what I thought it was
'Cause I've never known a love like this before ya
Baby, I know dreams tend to crumble at extremes
I just thought our dream would last a little bit longer
There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand
We're surviving, we're still living, are we stronger?

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate
I just thought we locked the gate when we left in the morning
And I was told that war is how we landed on these shores
I just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing? (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)

[Verse 3]
Baby, I know death probably hasn't happened yet
'Cause I don't remember living life before this
And darling, our disease is the same one as the trees
Unaware that they've been living in a forest

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing? (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
This life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing?"
Blame It On My YouthBlink-182,"[Intro: Matt Skiba]
Blame it, blame it on my youth

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
(Blame, blame, blame on my youth)

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
I wasn't made for the good life
I ended up getting stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
Tough breaks are the only kind I know
I was left on a door step
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbors' fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You could never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

[Bridge: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
I was raised on the Ritalin
Ever since I was a little kid (Little kid)
No one ever seemed to give a shit (Give a shit)
And I don't need an excuse
I don't need an excuse

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never kill my high (Endless summer)
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Stretching on and on)
Blame it, blame it on my youth (Oh, oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth (Oh, oh)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
Endless summer
Stretching on and on"
JoyBastille,"[Verse 1]
Thought I'd never be waking on the kitchen floor
But here I lie, not the first time
Now my morning has broken, and it brings the fear
My mind's falling, fall in

Then I feel my pulse quickening
But regrets can't change anything
Yeah, I feel my pulse quickening
When your name lights up the screen

Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?

Take a walk through the wreckage, clearing out my head
I hear your eyes roll right down the phone
I'm your walking disaster, keep on dragging me
From self-pity, poor me

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I feel my pulse quickening
But I wouldn't change a thing

[Chorus]
Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

[Post-Chorus]

As the night dissolves into this final frame
You're a sweet relief, you saved me from my brain
From my brain, from my brain, from my brain

Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

I feel joy when you call me

Life In The CityThe Lumineers,"[Intro]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo

And if the city's skyscrapers rise over this island
Would you be glad to see Manhattan for once?
I knew the dream, it died, JMZ line, Myrtle, and Broadway
But I'd be glad to see Manhattan for once

[Chorus]
Woah-woah, living life in the city
Woah-woah, it will never be pretty, oh, oh

Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah (2, 3, 4)

Woo, woo

[Verse 2]
And if you leave, don't leave me all alone
'Cause I'll be scared, I'll be naked, I'll get cold
And I miss my dad and Cleopatra sitting on a phone
So take me back off these streets and we'll never be apart
Together from the start
Never, never falling back alone

Living life in the city
Oh-oh, it will never be pretty, oh, oh
Oh-oh, we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah

And if the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you just lay down and dig your grave?
Or will you rail against your dying day?

""So, did you find the boat?""

[Verse 1]
From the mist, a shape, a ship, is taking form
And the silence of the sea is about to drift into a storm
Sign of power, show of force
Raise the anchor, battleship's plotting its course

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion, king of the ocean

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

[Verse 2]
Two thousand men, and fifty thousand tons of steel
Set the course for the Atlantic with the Allies on their heel
Firepower, firefight
Battle Stations, keep the targets steady in sight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Into formation, the hunt has begun
Death and damnation, the fleet is coming

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

They are bound by iron and blood
The flagship of the navy, the terror of the seas
His guns have gone silent at last

[Part 1]
In het Rijk waar iedereen elkaar al kent
Lekker hard aan het werk, zo verdienen ze hun cent
An die Arbeit, ja, het houdt hier echt nooit op
Alles zo efficient, is voor ons zo ongekend
Deutschland is zo tof, ik vind hun snelwegen vet
Net als hun muziek, ja, die is ook echt kek
Rammstein, Scooter, Tokio Hotel
Anton aus Tirol, ja, die ken jij toch ook wel?
Lekker gaan op die techno, bouncen op die beat
Los op Cascada, I put it on repeat
Berghain, KitKat und das Stattbad
Dat zijn alle plekken die ik vroeger niet betrad
Nu is dat anders, alles verandert
Met wat snoepjes op ben ik zo Duits als geen ander
Kaufen bij de ALDI, shoppen bij de LIDL
Appie is te duur ik ga naar Schland voor m'n Skittles

Geiles Bier en geile Bretzeln, Nenas Luftballons
Geile Autos, geile Autobahn, snel gaan
Geile Heidi Klum en alle ihre schönen Mädchen
Deutschland ist das geilste Reich der Welt

[Part 2]
Hé, als ik in Duitsland ben dan is alles altijd groots
En de bakkers zijn zo schoon, dat is daar echt heel gewoon
Ze verwelkomen alle mensen van de boot
Alle mensen vol met hoop en Frau Merkel in het rood
Ik moet wel echt bekennen dat de Duitsers zoveel toller zijn
Dat kun je niet ontkennen, naast het grote Rijk zijn wij zo klein
Met voetbal zijn ze baas, onteren onze kaas
In alle serieusheid is die Mannschaft echt niet dwaas
Duitsers zijn zo lief, ze zijn nooit echt heel koud
Voelen warm en vertrouwd, zeggen ik ook van jou
Zo’n rijke geschiedenis, weten wij wie de baas nu is
Met menselijke machines lezen ze ons immer die les
WK, EK, wat kunnen ze nog meer?
Al die overwinningen doen elke keer weer zeer
Tik, tok, tik, tok, ze zijn altijd op tijd
Die grote, mooie Duitsers zijn overal op voorbereid

Naar Oktoberfest, dat is echt niet best
Ja, ik drink maar door en maak op die fles
Ze laten ons lekker gaan

Hij is zo lekker gebraden

RylanThe National,"[Verse 1]
Rylan, you should try to get some sun
You remind me of everyone
Rylan, did you break your mother's heart?
Every time you tried to play your part

[Chorus]
Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Underwater, you're almost free
If you wanna be alone, come with me

[Verse 2]
Rylan, we can take the quick way out
We can turn blank white in a blank white house
Say that you're a pervert, you're a vulture
Don't you wanna be popular culture?

[Chorus]
Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Underwater, you're almost free
If you wanna be alone, come with me
Is it easy to live inside yourself?
All the little kids are high and hazy
Everybody's got nowhere to go
Everybody wants to be amazing

[Bridge]
Rylan, California's rotten
Dress light blue to be forgotten
Eat your pearls on Sunday morning
Keep your conversations boring
Stay with me among the strangers
Change your mind and nothing changes
Don't let show any emotion
When you climb into the ocean

[Outro]
Rylan, you should try to get some sun
There's a little bit of hell in everyone
Rylan, you should try to get some sun
You remind me of everyone
Rylan, you should try to get some sun
There's a little bit of hell in everyone
Rylan, you should try to get some sun"

They found your wallet in the cemetery
You told your daughter she was ordinary

You hate the name Junior
Your husband loved his computers
Your mother never was one
The eldest of seven children

If you don’t have it, then you'll never give it
And I don't blame you for the way you livin’
The little boy was born in February
You couldn't sober up to hold a baby

You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry

Hold my hand now, time to
Go to bed, it's way too late

You Had Your Soul With YouThe National,"[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
You had your soul with you, I was in no mood
Drift away, and I could forget
I had only one last feather left
I wore it on the island of my head
I had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger]
You felt like heaven stood up in you
You said love fills you out
It moves you from the skeleton and pulls you around
I got it worse than anyone else
And I just can't find a way to forgive myself
I had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet

[Verse 3: Gail Ann Dorsey & Matt Berninger]
I have owed it to my heart, every word I've said
You have no idea how hard I died when you left
If I yield to my trances, will I get up close again?
I had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet
I had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet

You had your soul with you, I was in no mood
You had your soul with you, I was in no mood"

Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong, but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?

Typical StoryHobo Johnson,"[Verse 1]
It’s a– It’s a– It’s a–
It’s a typical story
Where the bassist kills the singer
And the guitarist and the drummer
Find they’re in love with each other
It's the story of the kid
Who clearly won’t know what to say
When the love of his life starts to calmly walk away
And it’s the story of the dad
Who decides to chase his dream
He quits his job, he falls apart
And he loses everything
And it’s the story of the kid who just wants to make a record
Loves and crafts it but nobody ever, ever cares about it

[Chorus]
Well, hey, hey, what’s your name?
Talk is for the guys you hate
We should sit in silence
While we think of what to say, hey
Hey, hey, I don’t think this is working out
Will you forget I even asked you to come over to my house?
Hey, hey I don’t think I know much
But I know I couldn’t take a good punch
So if you feel like I’ve been talking enough
Just tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck up

[Verse 2]
And I’m afraid of everything
Staying the same or worsening
So what’s the point of finding calm
When calm to me is unsettling?
Settle down, little kid
Your bones are shaking in your skin
Go and try and take a breath
Though nothing more, nothing less
(It’s a– It’s a– It’s a–)
It’s a typical story of a king who had it all
Except for citizens who didn’t want his head up on a wall
It’s a typical story of the wife who couldn’t quit
Being in love with such a giant piece of shit
It’s the story of the queen who could never ever think
Of any redeeming qualities a man could ever bring
It’s the story of the dog who wanted to run away
'Til he learned that his life is way safer inside a cage

[Bridge]
I don’t really need much
Just a place to be alone and you won’t really see much
I think that I’m invisible
My mirror shows another guy
A guy who doesn’t do shit
He just sits and is miserable
Everybody’s gotta live a life
That they didn’t ask for, why
Why would he put me here
Just to die, just to, just to
Die?!

[Chorus]
Well, hey, hey, what’s your name?
Talk is for the guys you hate
We should sit in silence
While we think of what to say, hey
Hey, hey, I don’t think this is working out
Will you forget I even asked you to come over to my house?
Hey, hey I don’t think I know much
But I know I couldn’t take a good punch
So if you feel like I’ve been talking enough
Just tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck up

[Bridge]
Everybody’s gotta live a life
That they didn’t ask for
Why would he put me here
Just to die, just to, just to
Die?!

[Chorus]
Well, hey, hey, what’s your name?
Talk is for the guys you hate
We should sit in silence
While we think of what to say, hey
Hey, hey, I don’t think this is working out
Will you forget I even asked you to come over to my house?
And hey, hey I don’t think I know much
But I know I couldn’t take a good punch
So if you feel like I’ve been talking enough
Just tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck up and die"
Help Me StrangerThe Raconteurs,"[Intro]
If you call me, I'll come runnin'

They will back up every line, every line, every line

Get me back
On my feet, on my feet

If you call me, I'll come runnin'
You can call me anytime
And these sixteen strings we're strummin'

There's a motivation about you (Hey, hey)
That moves me when we're apart

But it's a sensitive device
I'm reverential when I hear you
I genuflect to your advice (Your advice)
Well, I wish I had the words
And I want those words to rhyme (Oh)
And I wish I had the nerve (Yeah, yeah)

NostalgicA R I Z O N A,"[Chorus]
Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

[Verse 1]
Oh, I felt weak tonight
'Cause I caught myself not being caught up with the times
Strangely, you and I cross the finish line
But big hearts move slow, get left behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying next to someone else, oh
But sometimes, I still remember what you said and how it felt

[Chorus]
Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
It's all locked up inside
This giant hole, this stupid quicksand life of mine
And I guess I can't let go, even though I've tried
But it'll stay here with me 'til the day I die

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying next to someone else, oh
But I'll always remember what you said and how it felt

[Chorus]
Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)
I can't stop it, woah, oh (Woah)

Oh, oh, oh (Woah, ooh)
('Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby I can't stop it)
Oh (Woah, woah)

('Cause the memories are flooding my mind)
Woah, I can't stop
Woah, I can't"

Last Day Under The SunVolbeat,"[Verse 1]
I'm in the lion’s cave
I've done it all before
I feel alive again
But maybe not for long
Another day will come
Full of light and desire

Are you right on track
Or has it gone too far?
Well, only you will know

Time Waits For No OneFreddie Mercury,"[Chorus]
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody

[Verse 1]
We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me
We've not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all now

[Chorus]
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
We've got to build this world together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time, it waits for nobody
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong
You know what's going on
And it seems to me we've not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all
It seems like we've all got our backs against the wall

[Bridge]
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
We've got to trust in one another
Or we'll have no more future at all

[Chorus]
Because time
Waits for nobody
Waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
Best not to be friends with one another
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody

Why Did You Run?Judah,"[Verse 1]
Got the call on the streets of Seattle
She said, ""Honey, I don't got much time to talk""
I broke down 'cause I knew what was next
And she said, ""I'm okay, but I'm locked in a holding cell
'Til someone gets me out
Can you help me? I have no one else""
So there I was, a defenseless middle kid
Crying out for the right words to say
Sorry, I can't do anything at all
So I hung up and called you
I hung up and called you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were the one, oh
You were the one I needed
You were the one, oh
You were the one I needed the most

[Chorus]
Why, why did you run?
Why, why did you run?
Why, why did you run? Oh

[Verse 2]
So I took a stupid fight with him after the accident
Funny now 'cause I thought it was your defense
'Cause I thought you were sober then
So there I was, a lost kid looking for a home that he once knew
So I broke down and called you
I broke down and called you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were the one, oh
You were the one I needed
You were the one, oh
You were the one I needed the most

[Chorus]
Why, why did you run?
Why, why did you run?
Why, why did you run? Oh

I just want you to be happy
Want you to be happy
Why can't you be happy?
Why can't you be happy?
Why can't you be happy?
Just want you to be happy
Why can't you be happy with us?

Why, why did you run? Oh"
Prom QueenBeach Bunny,"[Verse 1]
Shut up, count your calories
I never look good in mom jeans
Wish I was like you
Blue-eyed blondie, perfect body

Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your expectations
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
I was never cut out for Prom Queen

[Post-Chorus]
If I get more pretty, do you think he will like me?

[Verse 2]
Dissect my insecurities
I'm a defect surgical project
It's getting hard to breathe
There's plastic wrap in my cheeks

[Chorus 2]
Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your beauty standards
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
I was never cut out for Prom Queen

[Bridge]
If I'm pretty, will you like me?
They say beauty makes boys happy
I've been starving myself, carving
Skin until my bones are showing

Teach me how to be okay
I don't want to downplay my emotions
They say beauty is pain
You'll only be happy
If you look a certain way
I wanna be okay

ParentsYUNGBLUD,"[Intro]
Blah!

[Verse 1]
I was born in a messed up century
My favourite flavoured sweets are raspberry amphetamines
I bought a carburettor, age 16
I brush my teeth with bleach 'cause I ain't got time for cavities
My daddy put a gun to my head
Said, ""If you kiss a boy, I'm gonna shoot you dead""
So I tied him up with gaffer tape and I locked him in a shed
Then I went out to the garden and I fucked my best friend

[Chorus]
'Cause my high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive
'Cause parents ain't always right

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I-I-I

[Verse 2]
Threw a toaster in my bath, watch my mum and dad laugh
See a thousand volts go through the son they wish they never had
They told me casual affection leads to sexual infection
But it's hard to get an erection when you're so used to rejection
Yeah, the teacher fucked the preacher
But then he had to leave her
Had to wash away the sins of a male cheerleader
""Hi, nice to meet ya,"" got nothing to believe in
So let me know when my breathing stops

[Chorus]
'Cause my high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive
'Cause parents ain't always right

I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I

Tick, tock, stop the clock
Because I get the feeling that I'm gonna get shot
Tick, tock, stop the clock
Because I get the feeling that I'm gonna get shot

My high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive
'Cause parents ain't always right

Rolling a juke joint box in the corner
Trolling myself in the mirror at night
Keeping an eye on my grindstone future
Staying away from the left and the right

[Chorus 1]
California bored and razed
These days, she's living with another
Plastic features, perfect face
What a waste and I'm still thinking of her

[Verse 2]
Laying the cardinal sins on the table
Pouring the coffee out on the grounds
Changing the losses to wins if I'm able
Switching the pitch to an audible sound
Running the rounds of the mundane soldier
Trading the cards and erasing the names
Feeling a pounding, insane, colder
Sounding, system, feeding the flames

[Chorus 2]
Well, I'm Detroit born and raised
But these days, I'm living with another
You tell me she can be replaced
But that's not the case, I'm so lost without her

Trolling myself in the mirror at night
Keeping an eye on my grindstone future

Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here’s an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

[Verse 1]
While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

[Chorus]
I don’t need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just wanna feel like any other man
I won't show you the whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

[Post-Chorus]
Here’s an unexplainable one
Here’s an unexplainable one

[Verse 2]
I'm not ahead of my time, I just drew the first breath
If I’m alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

[Chorus]
I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don’t need you to hide it from me
I just wanna feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

[Post-Chorus]
What have you done?
What have you done?
Yeah

[Outro]
Oh, while I was learning to live, you taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted
Another needle in the back through purified scarification
It wasn't somebody else, you fucking did it to me
You want a real smile?
I haven't smiled in years"

My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I’ll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you’re a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine

Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

You'll Never Find MeKorn,"[Verse 1]
Life is degrading and silently making me
Spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

[Chorus]
So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside

Humiliating, I fall to its craving
It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading, our feelings I'm saving
To fix what I tore all apart

I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide

ChampionBishop Briggs,"[Verse 1]
Alone in my car, I'm in a parking lot, darkest spot in my mind
My tongue is dry, why do I crumble quickly, stumble swiftly?
Cursing myself, I burned the furniture a million times in my head
I'm feeling low, got nowhere to go, but back up again

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta get bruised before you get mad
You gotta fall down before you fight back
Was feeling so weak but baby I'm strong
Little did I know I'm a champion

I'm a champion

[Verse 2]
Nobody said it'd be an easy ride, obstacles in my way
Scars never change, why do I crumble quickly, stumble swiftly?
Cursing the world, I burn the songs I wrote a billion times in my head
I'm feeling low, got nowhere to go but back up again

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta get bruised before you get mad
You gotta fall down before you fight back
Was feeling so weak but baby I'm strong

No MoreDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
Once again we hear them calling for war
It doesn't matter what they're fighting for
They light the match and watch the whole world burst into flame
The story's always the same
So tell me, people, are you ready to kill?
Behold the propaganda, get your fill
A distant enemy is threatening our freedom again
How much would you like to spend?

[Pre-Chorus]
Millions are falling in line
And it's just a matter of time
Endless destruction will ensure their pockets are lined
For all time

[Chorus]
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Verse 2]
They don't care about the blood on their hands
Look at the world, and you will understand
They count the money as the innocent continue to bleed
They're always planting the seed
So tell me, people, are you ready to die
Without believing in the reason why?
They paint a picture, and the whole damn world is deceived
It's all that they ever need

[Pre-Chorus]
Millions keep falling in line
It's only a matter of time
Sowing destruction will make sure their pockets are lined
For all time

[Chorus]
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore

[Bridge]
No, it can't be disguised anymore
How they smile as we pay for their war

[Chorus]
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more"

It Doesn't Matter WhySilversun Pickups,"[Verse 1]

Have we all gone blind?

Your time is up, they're out for blood

"Lover, LeaverGreta Van Fleet","[Verse 1]
Oh, my holy Lord
Sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
She's my heart's desire
She's an angel straight from Hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness way below
It's my heart she'll keep
Yeah

Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind it takes the sky
And winter takes us all
Mountain high against the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing loud and smiling proud
This is where we lay

Saul would fall to his knees, watch the fire blaze

Watches as the peace of man slips and disappears

When Am I Gonna Lose YouLocal Natives,"[Verse 1]
Wait, when am I gonna lose you?
How will I let you slip through?
Careless or unkind?
Trace the curving of the coastline
The Santa Lucia cliffside
We'll stay here for the night

Everything has its place
Now I lie in our bed
Wondering how to explain

When am I gonna lose

[Verse 2]
Take another one if you need it
Or do you already feel it?
I felt it from the start
Engrave the silhouette of you dancing
A shadow play that we're cast in
On the cabin walls

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You were floating to me
In a slow-motion fade
Could I finally see
Between belief and faith?

You
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you, you?
When am I gonna lose

I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees tumbling down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you
I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees tumbling down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you

OutnumberedDermot Kennedy,"[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 1]
I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See, I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart (Yeah)
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go, just know it kills me to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

Don't tell me this is all for nothin'

I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 2]
But there's beauty here that's yet to depart
There's still a song inside the halls in the dark (Halls in the dark)
I'll come for you if you just stay where you are
And I'll always hold your hand in the car (Hand in the car)
There'll be days when it's difficult
But I ask you to never leave behind the reciprocal, we're past that
Love is not designed for the cynical
So we have that (We have that)
We can have that

Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

But I'd never change them
Liars, cheats, and hypocrites
Not the type for savin'

Heat Of The SummerYoung The Giant,"[Verse 1]
No one can take me out of this mess
I do it to myself
I lost my phone, my keys, what else?
The acid doesn't help
I'm paranoid as hell and I wanna
Go home but there's no place to run!

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer!

[Verse 2]
I've got to figure something out
But I don't know where to start
I found my keys under the couch
But I'm scared of going out
Having all these doubts and I'd rather
Stay home cuz there's no place to run!

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer

I'll be wasting time
In the sunshine
I'll be flying high
In the summer time

If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor

Every second counts
I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and
All these little games
You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah
Every minute counts
I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
Can you figure me out?
Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch

[Chorus]
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

[Verse 2]
Pour your glass of wine
Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah)
Cases under the bed
Spill it open, let it rush to my head
I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
Savor this with everything I have inside of me
I'm not the type to run
I know that we're having fun
But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed

[Bridge]
Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me

[Chorus]
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine

You got big plans, but you never take a chance, uh-huh

Die A LittleYUNGBLUD,"[Verse 1]
Just when life gets messed up
Just when you can't turn back

Take my foot off the gas
Step on paper-thin glass
Play the music and dance
It's my addiction

Help me turn off the lights
Calm down my obsessed mind

Hold my hands when I'm blind

Birth Of The CruelSlipknot,"[Intro]
Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him be provoked
Father, by self-control

[Verse 1]
I'm just a Judas, lookin' for a silver line
And tomorrow is still a step behind
Hey, hey, drama, I'd love to be a waste of your time
Oh no, thanks so much for wasting mine
So hear me out
Let's hear it for the damaged
Who understands but the broken?
Developed in the arms of spite
I'm all fucked up and I make it look good
Adrenaline sight tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

[Chorus]
Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the cruel

[Verse 2]
Remember how you spent the best part of forever
In a state of pure disease?
It was another thing altogether
To forget that you brought out the worst in me
Hey, karma, you don't feel like I do
You just wish you'd hate like I do
We are the bitter, the maladjusted and wise
Fighting off a generation too uptight
We're all dressed up with nobody to kill
The rhetoric stops tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me

Death of the fool, birth of the, birth of the cruel, yeah

Shifting the focus to scare

Welcome HomeHellYeah,"[Verse 1]
Far off in the distance, the storm's closing in
The pressure collapsing, bright skies become dim
This scent all around me, give memories new life
Knots that I've loosened still tangled inside
Ominous clouds, no sun in the sky
Is this a metaphor for my tragic demise?
The colors are gray on my canvas of life
The picture's complete, but the paint just won't dry

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home

[Verse 2]
And those dirty little whispers, demon's voice in my head
Angel over my shoulder, evil needs to be fed
Hot flashes turn cold as day turns to night
My head starts to ache because something's not right
Pour salt in my wounds, I'm cut deep inside
Battered and bruised, bones breaking, teeth bite
Tattered and torn, pour gas on my life
You can burn up the book, but the pages survive

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home, so welcome home

So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome

The sky is falling, the sky is falling down
The ocean's flooding, the oceans are swelling everywhere all around
The fire's burning, fire burns me to the ground
What the fuck was I waiting for?
All you fucking little pigs, I'll blow you down

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home, so welcome home

So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome home"
Sing AlongSturgill Simpson,"[Verse 1]
Words can stab as deep as night
And cut like a razored thorn
Bitter air and the winds of spite
Like the cold of winter's scorn
Leaves may fall on sleeping ground
But the wind sweeps them away
Like hurt lovers in the final round
What once was is now decayed

[Chorus]
I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone

[Verse 2]
A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancin' in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one
Compromise is made out of peace
But history's made out of violence
After the war of the words has ceased
All that's left is the deafenin' silence

I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong, so here's your song
Now sing along, baby

[Verse 3]
Well, I know you know that you're killin' me
But it's worth it just to see you smile
Tell 'em to carve my name in the barstool, baby
You know I'm gonna be here a while
A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancin' in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one

I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong, so here's your song
Now sing along"

Take Me Home TonightEddie Money,"Ohhh.. Yeah..

[Verse 1]
I feel a hunger, it's a hunger
That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer? I shouldn't wonder
When I can feel you whet my appetite
With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is running through me
Let's find the keys and turn this engine on

[Bridge]
I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (Faster)

[Chorus]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

[Verse 2]
I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares I hate to sleep alone
I need some company a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow

[Bridge]
I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (Faster)

[Chorus]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey , just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Be my little baby, uh-huh

Just like Ronnie sang
I said
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Baby, my darlin', uh, uh, oh, oh, oh

I feel a hunger
It's a hunger

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang

Pin The GrenadeBlink-182,"[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Back down off the ledge you're leaving me
Right  now it feels like you're bleeding me dry
Slow  down, you took away a piece of me
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go
Chokehold, I'm running out of oxygen
Tightrope,  tonight it's like I'm walking on air
Black  smoke, coming from the underground
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Hey,  wait, pin the grenade
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey, wait, get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just  another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
So hey, wait, pin the grenade
If you don't love me, lie to my face
If you don't love me, lie to my face

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
My god, how could you talk to me like that?
Let's stop, you changed your mind and caught a ride home
You dropped a hint that I embarrass you
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go
Midnight, I'm underneath the landslide
Fast life, I'll leave you on the side of the road
You cried, ""This isn't what you promised me""
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let

The First TimeBlink-182,"[Intro: Matt Skiba]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
First drink of the night just to get me right
The first light of the day, I know I got it all wrong
First pill that you drop only sets it off
The next morning you wake up all blurry and numb
Before all the damn insecurities
Before all your innocence is all lost
Think back to the time you were all alone
One day you'll look back and say, ""Where's it all gone?""

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
Sometimes we get lost inside our little heads

Taking all her meds (First love)
Sleeping with her friends (First high)
Find out in the end, there ain't (There ain't)

Tried to make her feel safe, but said it all wrong
First time in L.A., so she can't avoid
Feeling like she's failing all along

The End Of The GameWeezer,"[Verse 1]
Hey, Suzy, where you been today?
I'm looking for you every way
No sign of you when I wake up
I'm on an island with no sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like I've known you my whole life
You got me cryin' like when Aslan died
Now you're gone

[Chorus]
The melody can't find you
I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Ooh, hit me

[Verse 2]
I know that you would crank this song
Air-guitaring with your headphones on
We dig the same type of melodies
The ones to get you next to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I was Mick and you were Marianne (Marianne)
You would harmonize when I felt bad (I felt bad)
But now you're gone

[Chorus]
The melody can't find you
I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Ooh, hit me
Ooh

Am I your go-to or am I uncool?
With all of these extremes that I go to
All I want is to be wanted by you
All I want is to be wanted by you

But the melody can't find you
I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Ooh, hit me

Carry Me AwayJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummer
There must be more behind the summer
I want someone to make some trouble
Been way too safe inside my bubble, oh
Take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light

Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away

You carnivore, you loose cannon
Can I have some more? I can't understand it
You fast car, you foolish spender
You know you are, and I surrender
So come on over and wake me up
Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
You know I need you, and that's for sure
You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for

[Chorus]
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Where the sun hits my face all different
Carry me away
Carry me away"

10/10Rex Orange County,"[Verse 1]
I had to think about my oldest friends
Now, I no longer hang with them
And I can't wait to be home again
I had a year that nearly sent me off the edge
I feel like a five, I can't pretend
But if I get my shit together this year
Maybe I'll be a ten

[Pre-Chorus]
Help myself a little better
'Cause it's getting tirin'
And I can't wait for the summer
Now, I'm gonna need a moment

[Chorus]
I did it again, I did it again
No control over my emotions
One year on and I still can't focus
I did it again, yeah
I did it, I did it again
Twelve rounds in, fightin' solo
But nobody wins when it ends

[Verse 2]
We'll be placin' memories in frames
Invitin' people 'round to stay
And always owning up to things, to things
'Cause after all, I guess it all depends upon
The people you choose and where you're from
If so, I've been so lucky, so far, it's outrageous
I won't complain (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give myself a little credit
Since I dealt with all the pain
Yeah, I turned superhero
I'm comin' in Bruce Wayne

[Chorus]
Yeah, I did it again, I did it again
But this time I took control
And turned my shit 'round
Sometimes you gotta cut a bitch out
I'm livin' again, yeah
I'm livin', I'm livin' again

And though it's still hard work to find the words
I'm still gonna write this fuckin' song

The people you choose and where you're from"

Left underneath the light of dying stars (Dying stars)
Push me off of the edge of the world (Fall apart)
Watch me as I slowly fall apart
Set fire to the roof of your house
And waited for the sirens to wail (Sirens wail)
Left your favorite records to melt (Left to melt)

Well, what did I think would happen?
I wouldn't dream of asking
You waited here for me so long
I lived in fear that you moved on
What have I done to us? It seems
I've broken trust and shattered dreams
I only wish I'd spoken of
The loneliness since we broke up

Say a prayer that you'll make it to the other side
It won't make no sense and you lose your mind
We're lost in our ways (We're lost in our ways)

Before the shots ring out in the dead of night
We're stuck in our ways (We're stuck in our ways)
I've got so much to say, oh (I've got so much to say)
Showed up like shadows in this crowd
Brought the fire blinding
Came here to quickly tear us down, down, down

Knowing that I lost you?
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone

I went and searched for some answers
But all I found were monsters
They're under my bed
They're haunting this tie that's been severed

Through the ashes you once crept
I feel so hollow now
I'm trapped on this island
This island of regret

They left a note on the front door
With a time and a place as the tears poured from my eyes
Straight to the floor, there was no going back once we knew what they came for
And all I have here is heartache
And bones, and mirrors for me to break
Only so much bad luck a person can take
We quiver and quake, we shiver and shake

Still framed and blue, say nothing at all

On a crumbling edge, watch me falling apart
Feel the birds of prey circle over our home
Vultures in the ash, separating skin from bone

And that SoHo gallery
Saw the sights and your favorite paintings
You were as priceless as can be
Now I'm looking back at the city
The one that they say never sleeps
How'd things get so dark and shitty?
Sunrise always gives us the creeps

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
They say forgive and forget
As long as I live, I'll let
These feelings pound in my chest
Maybe I am better off dead

[Chorus: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
The last time that I saw her, she was standing on the edge
Of a good time, been a long time, tell me how could I forget?
She had questions in her eyes, oh, I should have realized
That it was over, yeah, it was over
The last time that I saw her

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
Now you're just a stranger
And I feel like I let you down
Your friends say I'm a failure
And I could never prove 'em wrong
So call me when you're lonely
And maybe we can work it out
Fall back in our routines
Like nights I still dream about
The last time that I saw her
The last time that I saw her

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
The last time that I saw her, she was standing on the edge
But it was over, yeah, it was over
The last time that I saw her"
Hungover YouBlink-182,"[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
A bottle for breakfast, trying to let go
Remember your voice, but it's only an echo (Only an echo)
I still got your makeup here on my pillow
And I'm seeing ghosts outside of my window

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
It was just one time, one time
Started turning into two times a few times
Ain't been sober in a long time, a long time
Yeah, you used to be all mine, all mine

[Chorus: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
I was so wasted, I couldn't see you
Didn't seem like a choice, no, I'd never leave you (Never leave you)
Nights that we stayed up, days that we sleep through
I can still see your face outside of my window

It was just one time, one time
Started turning into two times a few times
Ain't been sober in a long time, a long time
Yeah, you used to be all mine, all mine

Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray

Once invincible

Remember To Forget MeBlink-182,"[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Threw my wishes in a fountain
Deep down under where I found them
Don't let go, I'll probably drown in them
Three, two, one, but who's counting 'em?

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Hey, mom, I'm on my own
Scared to death and far from home
Can you imagine that, imagine that, imagine that?
You know I'm bad at that, bad at that, bad at that

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
You left pieces of me along the side of the road
Right after you said you'd never leave me alone
Found myself on the wrong side of the door
I'll come in if you let me
I got a song in my head you played me over the phone
Left the light on upstairs, but there ain't nobody home
All the nights that you end up all alone
Remember to forget me

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
This is hard, I'm one step off
I called but you're gone, I'm here but you're not
We both made a left, it don't make it right
I'm trying to forget, but remember the times

Hey, mom, I'm on my own
Scared to death and far from home

Say the word and I'll be there
Say the word and I'll be there

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
She was just a babe in the woods
He was always up to no good
Of course, they'd end up as one
(Say the word and I'll be there)

She took a late-night bus to L.A
He left home with nowhere to stay
Moving to the land of the sun
(Say the word and I'll be there)

They found a spot on Bunker Hill
Though getting by was hard
The phoenix slowly turned to ashes
Hope to broken hearts

Now she's holding him for ransom

Say the word and I'll be there
Say the word and I'll be there

Now she's holding him for ransom

Running Up That HillMeg Myers,"[Verse 1]

Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?

You
It's you and me

And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

[Verse 2]
You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy

Die HappyDREAMERS,"[Intro]
Yeah, I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time

I met a girl, she had expensive perfume
Was a waste of money, didn't smell so lovely like you
And now you're on my steps up late night
Chain smoking Pall Malls while I philosophize

[Pre-Chorus]
Glass sky, killin' time
You leaned upon my shoulder
And my thoughts dried, didn't mind

[Chorus]
So alive, I felt like I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time
Yeah, I could die now that I've been floating
High upon the smoke in your eyes

[Verse 2]
And I've been burned, yeah, and I've burned myself
Saw no point in falling just to burn somebody else
But now your dreams are catching my eye
Maybe we could stay up and pretend for a while

Glass sky, killing time
You leaned upon my shoulder
And my thoughts dried, didn't mind

So alive, I felt like I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time

High upon the smoke in your eyes

Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in his voice so sweet
I thought that I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will""

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time

Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Well, you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner of later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Spending the years together
Growing older every day (Every day)
I feel at home when I'm around you
And I'll gladly say again
I hope the encore lasts forever
Now there's time for us to spend
And it's sublime with you, my friend
This right here still feels like a honeymoon
When you say my name, nothing's changed
I'm still a boy inside my thoughts
Am I meant to understand my faults?

I don't think so
I don't think I'm meant to understand myself
Maybe you do
And that's good for you
Maybe in time
Maybe one day

I'm so typical, my life ain't difficult

I'm self-critical, a tryhard original

Hide under an umbrella (Yeah)

Try to stop my head from goin’ insane
Counting down all the days
I swear that there's a bright side too
Being alone outside, they
Cannot suffocate me when they
Cannot fucking chase me out (Ayy)
Anagram all of the letters
They’re tellin' me that I'm gonna be fine

Piece 'em together and jump off the sides

I’m going blind

Taking measures to defend

Yeah, I always fall
A little short in front of you

Alright, and if you still won't go
Tell your sister that I told her so
Tie that shirt onto another pole
Take a dip into the stash you stole
If you think I'm gonna leave that golden girl up alone all night
I may have tricked myself, she couldn't shake it
So I guess you might be right

So it's easy to believe
Well, I suppose it simply wasn't meant to be

In between a rock and a hard place
Trying to find your way through the dark days

Until you tell someone
You'll feel like you're the only one

Face down in the days that we wasted
Trying to find our way through the mazes

The JesterBadflower,"[Verse 1]
Like a jester at the ball
Rub my shoulders with the kings
And I was draped in gold and velvet
Bathing in applause
While I was jumping through the rings
And then the cooks would sound a bell
And all the kings would lick their lips
But I couldn't find a placemat
The dinner table's full
And there's no room for me to sit

[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there looking out for me?
Just say you want me, just say you need me
Is there anybody out there looking out for me?
Does anybody need me?
Is every last soul just fucking me over?
With tears on their shoes and ice on their shoulders
Is there anybody out there looking out for me?

[Verse 2]
Lord, I live to entertain
All my pride is in my praise
I hum along with this vibration
And hope to God I make it, mmh
If any chord that I could strum
Made me feel less like a man
I'd slam my fingers in the doorway
And shatter all the bones
So I could never strum again

[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there looking out for me?
Oh, just say you want me, just say you need me
Is there anybody out there looking out for me?
For me?
Is every last soul just fucking me over?

Is there anybody out there looking out for me?

Whoa, is there anybody out there looking out for me?
Oh, just say you want me, just say you need me
Is there anybody out there looking out for me?
For me?
Whoa, is every last soul just fucking me over?

Is there anybody out there looking out for me?
For me

Is every last soul just fucking me over?
With tears on their shoes and ice on their shoulders
Is there anybody out there looking out for me?"

Every morning, I ride on a carousel
To the sides of my mind that I cannot help
Had to die in Heaven just to get to Hell
Fell when the lights went out now
My real friends act like they don't know me
This headache's giving me a nosebleed
My silence is killing me slowly
I can't keep tuning it out and

You was outta pocket when you told me ""Die slow""
I was going through the shits, I kept it down low
Tongue-tied, tongue-tied, what we had was all lies

Popular MonsterFalling In Reverse,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway
Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase
I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
I battle with depression, but the question still remains
Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage?
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now with falling apart
I'm a popular, popular monster

[Verse 2]
I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace
I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace
How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste
Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention
I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing
And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave
I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again
Crashed my car just to feel again
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer

Falling into love now with falling apart
I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah

Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh
We're sick and tired of wondering
Praying to a god that you don't believe
You're searching for the truth in the lost and found
So the question I ask is, oh, where the fuck is your god now?

I'm hoping that some day, I can meet you on this Earth
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first

Dear Winter, I hope you like this song
And even when you're 13
And you scream at me for parenting you wrong
I hope it's still a badass song

But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
You know I cannot wait to teach you how to curse
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first

Dear Winter, don't move too far away
And please don't say I'm hovering
When I text you to ask about your day
I wanna hear about your day

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Will we still hang out and talk when I'm no longer in charge?
Oh, dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope you let me take a shot with you on your 21st
But shit, you gotta ask your mom first

Dear Winter, I'm looking for your mom
I gotta find a girl that doesn't mind that I'm inside my head a lot
Winter, it won't be too long
First, I just gotta find your mom"

Blind Leading The BlindMumford,"[Verse 1]
My generation's stuck in the mirror
""Forget about the poor, 'cause I don't like the word""
I need to know the name of my neighbor
I am not known if I'm not seen or heard
And I am afraid of that which I do not know
So why don't I just ask your fucking name?
Justice just gets buried in a white light
I heard there was a time you'd call it shame

[Chorus]
So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here

[Verse 2]
Your cynicism buys me no more time here
Imagine my relief to hit the walls
Running from the weight of ancient labels
And leaving what identity there was
Well, my generation's stuck in the mirror
""Forget about the poor, 'cause I don't like the word""
And I need to know the name of my neighbor
I am not known if I'm not seen or heard

[Chorus]
So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here

Let's raise our hands for a moment
And leave it all behind
Don't be afraid for a moment

New tears say that they will dry in time

Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?

Laughing together like our thoughts are harmonized
Been that way since '95
Give me direction when it is hard to fight
Three roads, one light
Now and then I can lean my back to yours
Travelin' like our feet don't touch the floor

I had a best friend but she has come to pass
One I wish I could see now
You always remind me that memories will last
These arms reach out
You were there to protect me like a shield
Long hair running with me through the field
Everywhere, you've been with me all along

Can I Call You Tonight?Dayglow,"[Verse 1]
I feel close
Well maybe I’m not, heaven knows
It’s a spotlight stuck on the ceiling
Why are these the things that I’m feeling?
There’s so much time
For me to speak up, but I keep quiet
I’ll complicate the most of the mantra
The power's out and I can’t turn the fan on

[Chorus]
So can I call you tonight?
I’m trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I’m no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real anymore?
Cause I wouldn’t know

[Verse 2]
Voice so low
Sneaking around, so it goes
I always try my best to listen
Picking up things that I can fidget
Circle speed
Pacing around, watching my feet
Batteries drain, I get the memo
“I think that I might have to let you go”

[Chorus]
So can I call you tonight?
I’m trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real?

LudensBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
Some resist the future, some refuse the past
Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact
That a world covered in cables was never wired to last
So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash

You're like a phantom greeting me

Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show

Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

[Verse 2]
Not a soul in the road
Not a star in the sky
It's a desert in my heart
And I know where to hide
I'm your king of nothing at all
And you're my queen of nothing at all

Well, out here in the dust
If you don't have trust
Ain't nothing left of us
This is the exodus
They're just testing us
They can't flex with us
They can't mess with us
They can't mess with us

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together
There can be loneliness?
Oh, our heart's a mess
But it's our only defense
To brave the wilderness

[Chorus]
Cross my heart
And hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other
In the so-called land of the free
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other"

You shine like a star
You know who you are
You're everything beautiful

Rx (Medicate)Theory Of A Deadman,"[Verse 1]
Wake up to a cloudy day
Dark rolls in, and it starts to rain
Staring out to the cage-like walls
Time goes by and the shadows crawl
Crushing candy, crushing pills
Got no job, mom pays my bills
Texting exes, get my fill
Sweating bullets, Netflix chills
World's out there singing the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself: ""Really, what's the use?""
I'm just like you, I was born to lose

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
When all I want's to get high
And forget this so-called life

[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)

[Verse 2]
Can't wait to feel better than I ever will
Attack that shit like a kid on Benadryl
Chase it down with a hopeful smile
Hate myself, I can go for miles
They say family's all you need
Someone to trust who can help you breathe
Inhale that drug, but you start to choke
You fall on the outs of an inside joke

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
Cause I've seen enough of it, heard enough of it, felt enough of it
Had enough of it!

[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)

[Bridge]
Superman is a hero
But only when his mind is clear, though
He needs that fix like the rest of us
So he's got no fear when he saves that bus
All the stars in the Hollywood Hills
Snapchat live while they pop them pills
All those flavors of the rainbow
Too bad that shit don't work though

[Post-Bridge]
Your friends are high right now
Your parents are high right now
That hot chick's high right now
That cop is high right now
The president's high right now
Your priest is high right now
Everyone's high as fuck right now
And no one's ever coming down!

[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)

Walk On WaterThirty Seconds To Mars,"[Intro]
(Do you believe?) Walk on water

[Verse 1]
Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Blood lust and a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
""Times are changing""
In the end, the choice was clear
Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

[Chorus]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe?)

[Verse 2]
Look at the sky, see a dying star
White lies, it's a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts
Times are changing
A thin line, the whole truth
The far right, the left view
Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing

[Chorus]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

Whatever It TakesImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"
No RootsAlice Merton,"[Verse 1]
I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Verse 2]
I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

[Chorus]
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots

[Verse 3]
I like standing still but that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Verse 4]
I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

[Chorus]
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots

I like digging holes, hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I won't forget to find them
I like digging holes, hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I won't forget to find them

I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots

I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground

The Sky Is A NeighborhoodFoo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
The sky is a neighborhood, so keep it down

Up All NightBeck,"[Verse 1]
When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up, you're working it 'round
Now get yourself together
When you call the dominoes fall, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm feeling so far away
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling up to the day
I hear the noise ringing
The sirens all singing

There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just wanna stay up all night with you

One, two, what you doing?
I been jumping through some hoops
Wanna get my body loose
Wanna tell you, tell you what to do

Looking for a diamond
I'm trying, I'm fighting
Right into the rhythm now

I just wanna stay up all night
Wanna stay up all night with you
With you, you

Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Hands up in the air
Living out on a prayer
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Up all night with you
With you, with you"
One More LightLinkin Park,"[Verse 1]
Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Verse 2 ]
The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

Who cares if one more light goes out?

Sit Next To MeFoster The People,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, it’s over, it’s over, I’m circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said “What’s up?” and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you but we’re always on the move
And now it’s over, we’re sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain’t getting younger, last call’s around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted and I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers ‘cause now all I want is you
Just sayin’

[Chorus]
Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high

[Verse 2]
Well, I ain’t frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light
But I’m here to tell you I’m not trying to change your mind
It’s alright, ooh, it’s alright, oooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

World Gone MadBastille,"[Verse 1]

It's not where we had wanted to be
If half the world's gone mad
The other half just don't care, you see

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want to fuck with us
British to the very last

[Chorus]
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it

[Verse 2]
So tell me what's the news
And what is it you want me to see
We're lying to ourselves
And dancing by the light of the screen

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want to fuck with us
British to the very last

[Chorus]
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it

Another man holding a microphone
Trying to say something at all
Or finding himself on an empty road
Trying to choose which way to go

So, you wanna make some money?
You wanna make some money
So, you wanna be somebody?
You wanna make some money

When it feels like the world's gone mad

When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it"
Ben Franklin's SongThe Decemberists,"[Verse 1]
Electricity! Yeah, you can all thank me
Took some lightning, a kite, and a fat brass key
And they're putting up streetlights in Gay Paris
You’re welcome from our young nation
I’m the only American the French wanna see
They call me a genius, I can’t disagree
They have guns, they have funds
They can set us free, invest in my reputation

[Chorus]
And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin

[Verse 2]
I said, early to bed, bitches, early to rise
They make a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
Soldiers are fighting for freedom, they have no supplies
So diplomacy happens at night
John Adams debates at the gates of Versailles
He whines and berates and awaits a reply
As I stay up late with a succulent breast or a thigh
Alright, diplomacy happens at night

[Chorus]
And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am 76-and-I’ll-Still-Kick-Your-Ass Fuckin’ Franklin

[Bridge]
One pain that lingers, the hitch in my stride
Is my son back at home who I could not guide
Who sits all alone in a prison cell on the wrong side
Stands against our young nation
So I play my ambassador part with pride
I am known in the world and the world is wide
To my children, my sins may be magnified
But I’d do it all again, no hesitation

[Chorus]
And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin
(Do you know who the fuck I am?) Who the fuck I am?
(Do you know who the fuck I am?) Who the fuck I am?
(Do you know who the fuck I am?)
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing

Harp and glass-armonica-playing

Those days are done, but I'm still glowing

You're The Best Thing About MeU2,"[Verse 1: Bono]
When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

[Verse 2: Bono]
I been crying out, ""How bad can a good time be?""
Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me
I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man who's determined to fall

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me

You're the best thing about me

Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away

Write it on a piece of paper, honey

Later when I'm sitting all alone

Hold Me Tight Or Don'tFall Out Boy,"[Intro]
Oh na na na na na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
I never really feel a thing, I'm just kinda too froze
You were the only one, that even kinda came close
I just pinch myself, no longer comatose
I woke up, no luck, I woke up, no luck

[Pre-Chorus]
And when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down

An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by

I got too high again, realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend, I love you to death, but I just can't
I just can't pretend, we were lovers first
Confidants but never friends, were we ever friends?

[Pre-Chorus]
But when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down

The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife

So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't

Here come old flat-top, he come grooving up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine, he's got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola

One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

I Only Lie When I Love YouRoyal Blood,"[Intro]
I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound

[Verse 1]
Go ahead, muck about
I got my conscience twisted
Pull your hair, make me shout
It's just that you insisted I was good for nothing
Like you were onto something

I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound

I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound

[Verse 2]
Go ahead, pull the plug
Broken finger, sticky trigger
Now I can't get it off my chest
And now I'm wishing you were someone else
You know I'm up to something
Diagnosed, no disease
Got a suspicion but you just can't find it up your sleeve
And now I beg the truth be told from someone else
All of that fuss for nothing

I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound

I only lie when I

Into The FireAsking Alexandria,"[Intro]
Take him out back
Take him out back
Take him out back

[Verse 1]
I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do with this
These hands, this mind, this instability
From a cage I created to a Hell that Heaven made
Can't let go of the hatred 'cause I love the way it tastes

[Pre-Chorus]
Take him out back

[Chorus]
I wouldn't take back a moment
Not one miserable moment
I'll give it all till there's nothing
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire

[Verse 2]
I've come to terms with the fact I'll never change
And that's just fine, I find solace in the pain
I don't mind the darkness, it's easy on the eyes
I'm praying for something to make me feel alive

I wouldn't take back a moment
Not one miserable moment
I'll give it all till there's nothing
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire

I'm a paranoid sycophant, masochistic dilettante
Narcissistic elephant in the room
I'm the end of the world thinning the herd
The all-around outta my mind, fucking absurd

I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire

Happy HourWeezer,"[Verse 1]
I'm like Stevie Ray Vaughan on the stage, high on music
Teeth grindin', sweatin' under the lights
But then my boss comes
And she's crushin' me with a 20-ton weight
Just like in Monty Python
Somebody left on the sink, it's still running
My eyes are gonna overflow

[Chorus]
I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)

[Verse 2]
I'm like Ponce de Leon
Setting on a ship for the new world
Checking out the birds and flowers
Let's chill out on this island, I've been
Sucking on a lime and coconut (coconut)
Coconut (coconut)
I think I could stay here for the rest of my life
Please, don't ever make me go home

[Chorus]
I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
It's my happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
We'll conversate about rare birds and MIDI keyboards
And we'll slow dance, head on my shoulder
Swayin' back and forth and
My friends look on and smile
Everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
It's my happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)
I need happy hour, to save me
Maybe I'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
We'll conversate about rare birds and MIDI keyboards
And we'll slow dance
I need a happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)"
The ResistanceSkillet,"[Verse 1: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
(I) am a nation, (I) am a million faces
Formed together, made for elevation
(I) am a soldier, (I) won't surrender
Faith is like a fire that never burns to embers
(Who's gonna stand up, who's gonna fight?)
The voice of the unheard
(Who's gonna break these chains and lies?)
Love is the answer
I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside
I, I, can't, can't sit here quiet

[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]
You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

[Chorus: John Cooper]
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

[Verse 2: John Cooper]
(Hey) Can you hear me? (Hey) Are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history
(Walk) through the fire, (Walk) on the water
Used to be a slave, but now you are a conqueror

They can take my heart, they can take my breath
When they pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

[Bridge: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
The voice of the unheard
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

[Chorus: John Cooper]
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us"
Go To WarNothing More,"[Verse 1]
I don't know what you had in mind
But here we stand on opposing sides
Let's go to war
Let's go to war
We arm ourselves with the wrongs we've done
Name them off one by one
Let's go to war
Let's go to war

Everything you say
Everything you do
You push it in
And you cut me down
And you cut me down
(War, war, war)

Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?

[Verse 2]
Hush my baby; make no sound
Maybe we can wait each other out
It's a cold war
Let's go to war

With every settled score
I thought that fighting with meant fighting for
But you turn it around
But you turn it around
(War, war, war)

[Chorus]
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?

[Bridge]
Do we censor or do we flow?
Are we drunk on the chemicals?
Every feeling in my bones tells me to lash out
And tell you to fuck off
You've got my heart
And I've got your soul
But are we better off alone?
With every battle, we lose a little more
Remember everything that we'd die for
You are everything that I'd die for

[Chorus]
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do you feel safe?"

Girl You Think You KnowMy Silent Bravery,"Banquet halls are a very special place, where under one big roof so many different memories are made. From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls.

1. The Chicken Dance
This song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.

2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios
A major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.

3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA
Light-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.

4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion
The words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, ""My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!"" with Celine.

5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey
The ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.

These time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.

riage, first gave sign
Unto his contract; fire and air did shine,
As guilty of the match; and from the hill
The nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.
Here first began their bane; this day was ground
Of all their ills; for now, nor rumour's sound,
Nor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;
Her love no longer now by stealth is sought:
She calls this wedlock, and with that fair name
Covers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,
Through all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;
Fame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,
That moving grows, and flying gathers strength,
Little at first, and fearful; but at length
She dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud
With feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!
This child, our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite
Of all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,
She was last sister of that giant race
That thought to scale Jove' s court; right swift of pace,
And swifter far of wing; a monster vast,
And dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed
On her huge corps, so many waking eyes
Stick underneath; and, which may stranger rise
In the report, as many tongues she bears,
As many mouths, as many listening ears.
Nightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,
And through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries,
Nor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;
By day on tops of houses she doth keep,
Or on high towers; and doth thence affright
Cities and towns of most conspicuous site:
As covetous she is of tales and lies,
As prodigal of truth: this monster—

Lup.
[within.] Come, follow me, assist me, second me! Where'! the
emperor?

1 Eques.
[within.] Sir, you must pardon us.

2 Eques.
[within.] Caesar is private now; you may not enter.

Tuc.
[within.] Not enter! Charge them upon their allegiance,
cropshin.

1 Eques.
[within.] We have a charge to the contrary, sir.

Lup.
[within.] I pronounce you all traitors, horrible traitors:
What! do you know my affairs? I have matter of danger and state to impart to Caesar.

Caes.
What noise is there? who's that names Caesar?

Lup.
[within.] A friend to Caesar. One that, for Caesar's good,
would speak with Caesar.

Caes.
Who is it? look, Cornelius.

1 Eques.
[within.] Asinius Lupus.

Caes.
O, bid the turbulent informer hence;
We have no vacant ear now, to receive
The unseason'd fruits of his officious tongue.

Mec.
You must avoid him there.

Lup.
[within.] I conjure thee, as thou art. Caesar, or respectest
thine own safety, or the safety of the state, Caesar, hear me,
speak with me, Caesar; 'tis no common business I come about, but
such, as being neglected, may concern the life of Caesar.

Caes.
The life of Caesar! Let him enter. Virgil, keep thy seat.
Enter Lupus, Tucca, and Lictors.

Eques.
[within.] Bear back, there: whither will you? keep back!

Tuc.
By thy leave, goodman usher: mend thy peruke; so.

Lup.
Lay hold on Horace there; and on Mecaenas, lictors. Romans,
offer no rescue, upon your allegiance: read, royal Caesar.
[Gives a paper.] I'll tickle you, Satyr.

Tuc.
He will, Humours, he will; he will squeeze you, poet
puck-fist.

Lup.
I'll lop you off for an unprofitable branch, you satirical
varlet.

Tuc.
Ay, and Epaminondas your patron here, with his flagon chain;
come, resign: [takes off Mecaenas' chain,] though 'twere your great grandfather's, the law has made it mine now, sir. Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.

Caes.
What is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.

Lup.
Not understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious
libel; a libel in picture.

Caes.
A libel!

Lup.
Ay, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his
house, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.

Tuc.
Ay, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of
these hungry court-hounds scent it out.

Caes.
Shew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.

Lup.
Know it! his hand is at it, Caesar.

Caes.
Then 'tis no libel.

Hor.
It is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for
Mecaenas.

Lup.
An emblem! right: that's Greek for a libel. Do but mark how
confident he is.

Hor.
A just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;
Not, though the malice of traducing tongues,
The open vastness of a tyrant's ear,
The senseless rigour of the wrested laws,
Or the red eyes of strain'd authority,
Should, in a point, meet all to take his life:
His innocence is armour 'gainst all these.

Lup.
Innocence! O impudence! let me see, let me see! Is not here an
eagle! and is not that eagle meant by Caesar, ha? Does not Caesar
give the eagle? answer me; what sayest thou?

Tuc.
Hast thou any evasion, stinkard?

Lup.
Now he's turn'd dumb. I'll tickle you, Satyr.

Hor.
Pish: ha, ha!

Lup.
Dost thou pish me? Give me my long sword.

Hor.
With reverence to great Caesar, worthy Romans,
Observe but this ridiculous commenter;
The soul 'to my device was in this distich:
Thus oft, the base and ravenous multitude
Survive, to share the spoils of fortitude.
Which in this body I have figured here,
A vulture—

Lup.
A vulture! Ay, now, 'tis a vulture. O abominable! monstrous!
monstrous! has not your vulture a beak? has it not legs, and
talons, and wings, and feathers?

Tuc.
Touch him, old buskins.

Hor.
And therefore must it be an eagle?

Mec.
Respect him not, good Horace: say your device.

Hor.
A vulture and a wolf

Lup.
A wolf! good: that's I; I am the wolf: my name's Lupus; I am
meant by the wolf. On, on; a vulture and a wolf

Hor.
Preying upon the carcass of an ass—

Lup.
An ass! good still: that's I too; I am the ass. You mean me by
the ass.

Mec.
Prithee, leave braying then.

Hor.
If you will needs take it, I cannot with modesty give it from
you.

Mec.
But, by that beast, the old Egyptians
Were wont to figure, in their hieroglyphics,
Patience, frugality, and fortitude;
For none of which we can suspect you, tribune.

Caes.
Who was it, Lupus, that inform'd you first, This should be
meant by us? Or was't your comment?

Lup.
No, Caesar; a player gave me the first light of it indeed.

Tuc.
Ay, an honest sycophant-like slave, and a politician besides

Caes.
Where is that player?

Tuc.
He is without here.

Caes.
Call him in.

Tuc.
Call in the player there: master AEsop, call him.

Equites.
[within.] Player! where is the player? bear back: none but
the player enter.

[Enter AESOP, followed by CRISPINUS and DEMETRIUS.

Tuc.
Yes, this gentleman and his Achates must.

Cris.
Pray you, master usher:—we'll stand close, here.

Tuc.
'Tis a gentleman of quality, this; though he be somewhat out
of clothes, I tell ye.—Come, AEsop, hast a bay-leaf in thy mouth?
Well said; be not out, stinkard. Thou shalt have a monopoly of
playing confirm'd to thee, and thy covey, under the emperor's broad seal, for this service.

Caes.
Is this he?

Lup.
Ay, Caesar, this is he.

Caes.
Let him be whipped. Lictors, go take him hence.
And, Lupus, for your fierce credulity,
One fit him with a pair of larger ears:
'Tis Caesar's doom, and must not be revoked.
We hate to have our court and peace disturb'd
With these quotidian clamours. See it done.

Lup.
Caesar! 

[Exeunt some of the Lictors, with Lupus and AEsop

Caes.
Gag him, [that] we may have his silence.

Virg.
Caesar hath done like Caesar. Fair and just
Is his award, against these brainless creatures.
'Tis not the wholesome sharp morality,
Or modest anger of a satiric spirit,
That hurts or wounds the body of the state;
But the sinister application
Of the malicious, ignorant, and base
Interpreter; who will distort, and strain
The general scope and purpose of an author
To his particular and private spleen.

Caes.
We know it, our dear Virgil, and esteem it
A most dishonest practice in that man,
Will seem too witty in another's work.
What would Cornelius Gallus, and Tibullus?

[They whisper Caesar.

Tuc.
[to Mecaenas.] Nay, but as thou art a man, dost hear! a man
of worship and honourable: hold, here, take thy chain again.
Resume, mad Mecoenas. What! dost thou think I meant to have kept it, old boy? no: I did it but to fright thee, I, to try how thou
would'st take it. What! will I turn shark upon my friends, or my
friends' friends? I scorn it with my three souls. Come, I love
bully Horace as well as thou dost, I: 'tis an honest hieroglyphic.
Give me thy wrist, Helicon. Dost thou think I'll second e'er a
rhinoceros of them all, against thee, ha? or thy noble Hippocrene,
here? I'll turn stager first, and be whipt too: dost thou see,
bully?

Caes.
You have your will of Caesar: use it, Romans.
Virgil shall be your praetor: and ourself
Will here sit by, spectator of your sports;
And think it no impeach of royalty.
Our ear is now too much profaned, grave Maro,
With these distastes, to take thy sacred lines;
Put up thy book, till both the time and we
Be fitted with more hallow'd circumstance
For the receiving of so divine a work.
Proceed with your design.

Mec. Gal. Tib.
Thanks to great Caesar.

Gal.
Tibullus, draw you the indictment then, whilst Horace arrests
them on the statute of Calumny. Mecaenas and I will take our
places here. Lictors, assist him.

Hor.
I am the worst accuser under heaven.

Gal.
Tut, you must do it; 'twill be noble mirth.

Hor.
I take no knowledge that they do malign me.

Tib.
Ay, but the world takes knowledge.

Hor.
Would the world knew
How heartily I wish a fool should hate me!

Tuc.
Body of Jupiter! what! will they arraign my brisk Poetaster
and his poor journeyman, ha? Would I were abroad skeldering for, a drachm, so I were out of this labyrinth again! I do feel myself
turn stinkard already: but I must set the best face I have upon't
now.
[Aside.]—Well said, my divine, deft Horace, bring the whoreson detracting slaves to the bar, do; make them hold up their spread golls: I'll give in evidence for thee, if thou wilt. Take courage, Crlspinus; would thy man had a clean band!

Cris.
What must we do, captain?

Tuc.
Thou shalt see anon: do not make division with thy legs so.

Caes.
What's he. Horace?

Hor.
I only know him for a motion, Caesar.

Tuc.
I am one of thy commanders, Caesar; a man of service and
action: my name is Pantilius Tucca; I have served in thy wars
against Mark Antony, I.

Caes.
Do you know him, Cornelius?

Gal.
He's one that hath had the mustering, or convoy of a company
now and then: I never noted him by any other employment.

Caes.
We will observe him better.

Tib.
Lictor, proclaim silence in the court.

Lict.
In the name of Caesar, silence!

Tib.
Let the parties, the accuser and the accused, present
themselves.

Lict.
The accuser and the accused, present yourselves in court.

Cris.
Dem. Here.

Virg.
Read the indictment.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your
hands. You are, before this time, jointly and severally indicted,
and here presently to be arraigned upon the statute of calumny, or
Lex Remmia, the one by the name of Rufus Laberius Crispinus, alias
Cri-spinus, poetaster and plagiary, the other by the name of
Demetrius Fannius, play-dresser and plagiary. That you (not having
the fear of Phoebus, or his shafts, before your eyes) contrary to
the peace of our liege lord, Augustus Caesar, his crown and
dignity, and against the form of a statute, in that case made and
provided, have moat ignorantly, foolishly, and, more like
yourselves, maliciously, gone about to deprave, and calumniate the
person and writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus, here present,
poet, and priest to the Muses, and to that end have mutually
conspired and plotted, at sundry times, as by several means, and in
sundry places, for the better accomplishing your base and envious
purpose, taxing him falsely, of self-love, arrogancy, impudence,
railing, filching by translation, etc. Of all which calumnies, and
every of them, in manner and form aforesaid, what answer you! Are you guilty, or not guilty?

Tuc.
Not guilty, say.

Cris.
Dem. Not guilty.

Tib.
How will you be tried?
[Aside to Crispinus.

Tuc.
By the Roman Gods, and the noblest Romans.

Cris.
Dem. By the Roman gods, and the noblest Romans.

Virg.
Here sits Mecaenas, and Cornelius Gallus, are you contented
to be tried by these?
[Aside.

Tuc.
Ay, so the noble captain may be joined with them in
commission, say.

Cris.
Dem. Ay, so the noble captain may be joined
with them in commission.

Virg.
What says the plaintiff?

Hor.
I am content.

Virg.
Captain, then take your place.

Tuc.
alas, my worshipful praetor! 'tis more of thy gentleness than
of my deserving, I wusse. But since it hath pleased the court to
make choice of my wisdom and gravity, come, my calumnious
varlets; let's hear you talk for yourselves, now, an hour or two.
What can you say? Make a noise. Act, act!

Virg.
Stay, turn, and take an oath first. You shall swear,
By thunder-darting Jove, the king of gods,
And by the genius of Augustus Caesar;
By your own white and uncorrupted souls,
And the deep reverence of our Roman justice;
To judge this case, with truth and equity:
As bound by your religion, and your laws.
Now read the evidence: but first demand
Of either prisoner, if that writ be theirs.
[Gives him two papers.

Tib.
Shew this unto Crispinus. Is it yours?

Tuc.
Say, ay. [Aside.]—What! dost thou stand upon it, pimp! Do not
deny thine own Minerva, thy Pallas, the issue of thy brain.

Oris.
Yes it is mine.

Tib.
Shew that unto Demetrius. Is it yours?

Dem.
It is.

Tuc.
There's a father will not deny his own bastard now, I warrant
thee.

Virg.
Read them aloud.

Tib.
Ramp up my genius, be not retrograde;
But boldly nominate a spade a spade
What, shall thy lubrical and glibbery muse
Live, as she were defunct, like punk in stews!

Tuc.
Excellent!

Alas! that were no modern consequence,
To have cothurnal buskins frighted hence.
No, teach thy Incubus to poetise;
And throw abroad thy spurious snotteries,
Upon that puft-up lump of balmy froth.

Tuc.
Ah, Ah!

Or clumsy chilblain'd judgment; that with oath
Magnificates his merit; and beapawls
The conscious time, with humorous foam and brawls,
As if his organons of sense would crack
The sinews of my patience. Break his back,
O poets all and some! for now we list
Of strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist.
CRISPINUS.

Tuc.
Ay, marry, this was written like a Hercules in poetry, now.

Caes.
Excellently well threaten'd!

Virg.
And as strangely worded, Caesar.

Caes.
We observe it.

Virg.
The other now.

Tuc.
This is a fellow of a good prodigal tongue too, this will do
well.

Tib.
Our Muse is in mind for th' untrussing a poet,
I slip by his name, for most men do know it:
A critic, that all the world bescumbers
With satirical humours and lyrical numbers:

Tuc.
Art thou there, boy?

And for the most part, himself doth advance
With much self-love, and more arrogance.

Tuc.
Good again!

And, but that I would not be thought a prater,
I could tell you he were a translator.
I know the authors from whence he has stole,
And could trace him too, but that
I understand them not full and whole.

Tuc.
That line is broke loose from all his fellows: chain him up
shorter, do.

The best note I can give you to know him by,
Is, that he keeps gallants' company;
Whom I could wish, in time should him fear,
Lest after they buy repentance too dear.
DEME. FANNIUS.

Tuc.
Well said! This carries palm with it.

Hor.
And why, thou motley gull, why should they fear!
When hast thou known us wrong or tax a friend?
I dare thy malice to betray it. Speak.
Now thou curl'st up, thou poor and nasty snake,
And shrink'st thy poisonous head into thy bosom:
Out, viper! thou that eat'st thy parents, hence!
Rather, such speckled creatures, as thyself,
Should be eschew'd, and shunn'd; such as will bite
And gnaw their absent friends, not cure their fame;
Catch at the loosest laughters, and affect
To be thought jesters; such as can devise
Things never seen, or head, t'impair men's names,
And gratify their credulous adversaries;
Will carry tales, do basest offices,
Cherish divided fires, and still encrease
New flames, out of old embers; will reveal
Each secret that's committed to their trust:
These be black slaves; Romans, take heed of these.

Tuc.
Thou twang'st right, little Horace: they be indeed a couple of
chap-fall'n curs. Come, we of the bench, let's rise to the urn, and
condemn them quickly.

Virg.
Before you go together, worthy Romans,
We are to tender our opinion;
And give you those instructions, that may add
Unto your even judgment in the cause:
Which thus we do commence. First, you must know,
That where there is a true and perfect merit,
There can be no dejection; and the scorn
Of humble baseness, oftentimes so works
In a high soul, upon the grosser spirit,
That to his bleared and offended sense,
There seems a hideous fault blazed in the object;
When only the disease is in his eyes.
Here-hence it comes our Horace now stands tax'd
Of impudence, self-love, and arrogance,
By those who share no merit in themselves;
And therefore think his portion is as small.
For they, from their own guilt, assure their souls,
If they should confidently praise their works,
In them it would appear inflation:
Which, in a full and well digested man,
Cannot receive that foul abusive name,
But the fair title of erection.
And, for his true use of translating men,
It still hath been a work of as much palm,
In clearest judgments, as to invent or make,
His sharpness,—-that is most excusable;
As being forced out of a suffering virtue,
Oppressed with the license of the time:—-
And howsoever fools or jerking pedants,
Players, or suchlike buffoon barking wits,
May with their beggarly and barren trash
Tickle base vulgar ears, in their despite;
This, like Jove's thunder, shall their pride control,
""The honest satire hath the happiest soul.""

Now, Romans, you have heard our thoughts;
withdraw when you please.

Tib.
Remove the accused from the bar.

Tuc.
Who holds the urn to us, ha? Fear nothing, I'll quit you, mine
honest pitiful stinkards; I'll do't.

Cris.
Captain, you shall eternally girt me to you, as I am
generous.

Tuc.
Go to.

Caes.
Tibullus, let there be a case of vizards privately provided;
we have found a subject to bestow them on.

Tib.
It shall be done, Caesar.

Caes.
Here be words, Horace, able to bastinado a man's ears.

Hor. Ay.
Please it, great Caesar, I have pills about me,
Mixt with the whitest kind of hellebore,
Would give him a light vomit, that should purge
His brain and stomach of those tumorous heats:
Might I have leave to minister unto him.

Caes.
O, be his AEsculapius, gentle Horace!
You shall have leave, and he shall be your patient. Virgil,
Use your authority, command him forth.

Virg.
Caesar is careful of your health, Crispinus;
And hath himself chose a physician
To minister unto you: take his pills.

Hor.
They are somewhat bitter, sir, but very wholesome.
Take yet another; so: stand by, they'll work anon.

Tib.
Romans, return to your several seats: lictors, bring forward
the urn; and set the accused to the bar.

Tuc.
Quickly, you whoreson egregious varlets; come forward. What!
shall we sit all day upon you? You make no more haste now, than a
beggar upon pattens; or a physician to a patient that has no money,
you pilchers.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your
hands. You have, according to the Roman custom, put yourselves upon trial to the urn, for divers and sundry calumnies, whereof you
have, before this time, been indicted, and are now presently
arraigned: prepare yourselves to hearken to the verdict of your
tryers. Caius Cilnius Mecaenas pronounceth you, by this
hand-writing, guilty. Cornelius Gallus, guilty. Pantilius Tucca—

Tuc.
Parcel-guilty, I.

Dem.
He means himself; for it was he indeed
Suborn'd us to the calumny.

Tuc.
I, you whoreson cantharides! was it I?

Dem.
I appeal to your conscience, captain.

Tib.
Then you confess it now?

Dem.
I do, and crave the mercy of the court.

Tib.
What saith Crispinus?

Cris.
O, the captain, the captain—-

Bor.
My physic begins to work with my patient, I see.

Virg.
Captain, stand forth and answer.

Tuc.
Hold thy peace, poet praetor: I appeal from thee to Caesar, I.
Do me right, royal Caesar.

Caes.
Marry, and I will, sir.—-Lictors, gag him; do.
And put a case of vizards o'er his head,
That he may look bifronted, as he speaks.

Tuc.
Gods and fiends! Caesar! thou wilt not, Caesar, wilt thou?
Away, you whoreson vultures; away. You think I am a dead corps now, because Caesar is disposed to jest with a man of mark, or so. Hold  your hook'd talons out of my flesh, you inhuman harpies. Go to, do't. What! will the royal Augustus cast away a gentleman of
worship, a captain and a commander, for a couple of condemn'd
caitiff calumnious cargos?

Caes.
Dispatch, lictors.

Tuc. Caesar!
[The vizards are put upon him.

Caes.
Forward, Tibullus.

Virg.
Demand what cause they had to malign Horace.

Dem.
In troth, no great cause, not I, I must confess; but that he
kept better company, for the most part, than I; and that better men
loved him than loved me; and that his writings thrived better than
mine, and were better liked and graced: nothing else.

Virg.
Thus envious souls repine at others' good.

Hor.
If this be all, faith, I forgive thee freely.
Envy me still, so long as Virgil loves me,
Gallus, Tibullus, and the best-best Caesar,
My dear Mecaenas; while these, with many more,
Whose names I wisely slip, shall think me worthy
Their honour'd and adored society,
And read and love, prove and applaud my poems;
I would not wish but such as you should spite them.

Cris.
O—!

Tib.
How now, Crispinus? C

Cris.
O, I am sick—!

Hor.
A bason, a bason, quickly; our physic works. Faint not, man.

Cris.
O———retrograde———reciprocal———incubus.

Caes.
What's that, Horace?

Hor.
Retrograde, reciprocal, and incubus, are come up.

Gal.
Thanks be to Jupiter!

Cris.
O———glibbery———lubrical———defunct———O———!

Hor.
Well said; here's some store.

Virg.
What are they?

Hor.
Glibbery, lubrical, and defunct.

Gal.
O, they came up easy.

Cris.
O———O———!

Tib.
What's that?

Hor.
Nothing yet.

Cris.
Magnificate———

Mec.
Magnificate!  That came up somewhat hard.

Hor.
Ay. What cheer, Crispinus?

Cris.
O! I shall cast up my———spurious———snotteries———

Hor.
Good. Again.

Oris.
Chilblain'd———O———O———clumsie———

Hor.
That clumsie stuck terribly.

Mec.
What's all that, Horace?

Hor.
Spurious, snotteries, chilblain'd, clumsie.

Tib.
O Jupiter!

Gal.
Who would have thought there should have been such a deal of
filth in a poet?

Cris.
O———balmy froth———

Caes.
What's that?

Cris.
———Puffie———inflate———turgidious———-ventosity.

Hor.
Balmy, froth, puffie, inflate, turgidous, and ventosity are
come up.

Tib.
O terrible windy words.

Gal.
A sign of a windy brain.

Cris.
O———oblatrant———furibund———fatuate———strenuous—-

Hor.
Here's a deal; oblatrant, furibund, fatuate, strenuous.

Caes.
Now all's come up, I trow. What a tumult he had in his belly?

Hor.
No, there's the often conscious damp behind still.

Cris.
O———conscious———damp.

Hor.
It is come up, thanks to Apollo and AEsculapius: another; you
were best take a pill more.

Cris.
O, no; O———O———O———O———O!

Hor.
Force yourself then a little with your finger.

Cris.
O———O———prorumped.

Tib.
Prorumped I What a noise it made! as if his spirit would have
prorumpt with it.

Cris.
O———O———O!

Virg.
Help him, it sticks strangely, whatever it is.

Cris.
O———clutcht

Hor.
Now it is come; clutcht.

Caes.
Clutcht!  it is well that's come up; it had but a narrow
passage.

Cris.
O———!

Virg.
Again! hold him, hold his head there.

Cris.
Snarling gusts———quaking custard.

Hor.
How now, Crispinus?

Cris.
O———obstupefact.

Tib.
Nay, that are all we, I assure you.

Hor.
How do you feel yourself?

Cris.
Pretty and well, I thank you.

Virg.
These pills can but restore him for a time,
Not cure him quite of such a malady,
Caught by so many surfeits, which have fill'd
His blood and brain thus full of crudities:
'Tis necessary therefore he observe
A strict and wholesome diet. Look you take
Each morning of old Cato's principles
A good draught next your heart; that walk upon,
Till it be well digested: then come home,
And taste a piece of Terence, suck his phrase
Instead of liquorice; and, at any hand,
Shun Plautus and old Ennius: they are meats
Too harsh for a weak stomach.
Use to read (But not without a tutor) the best Greeks,
As Orpheus, Musaeus, Pindarus,
Hesiod, Callimachus, and Theocrite,
High Homer; but beware of Lycophron,
He is too dark and dangerous a dish.
You must not hunt for wild outlandish terms,
To stuff out a peculiar dialect;
But let your matter run before your words.
And if at any time you chance to meet
Some Gallo-Belgic phrase; you shall not straight.
Rack your poor verse to give it entertainment,
But let it pass; and do not think yourself
Much damnified, if you do leave it out,
When nor your understanding, nor the sense
Could well receive it. This fair abstinence,
In time, will render you more sound and clear:
And this have I prescribed to you, in place
Of a strict sentence; which till he perform,
Attire him in that robe. And henceforth learn
To bear yourself more humbly; not to swell,
Or breathe your insolent and idle spite
On him whose laughter can your worst affright.

Tib.
Take him away.

Cris.
Jupiter guard Caesar!

Virg.
And for a week or two see him lock'd up
In some dark place, removed from company;
He will talk idly else after his physic.
Now to you, sir. [to Demetrius.] The extremity of law
Awards you to be branded in the front,
For this your calumny: but since it pleaseth
Horace, the party wrong'd, t' intreat of Caesar
A mitigation of that juster doom,
With Caesar's tongue thus we pronounce your sentence.
Demetrius Fannius, thou shalt here put on
That coat and cap, and henceforth think thyself
No other than they make thee; vow to wear them
In every fair and generous assembly,
Till the best sort of minds shall take to knowledge
As well thy satisfaction, as thy wrongs.

Hor.
Only, grave praetor, here, in open court,
I crave the oath for good behaviour
May be administer'd unto them both.

Virg.
Horace, it shall: Tibullus, give it them.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, lay your
hands on your hearts. You shall here solemnly attest and swear,
that never, after this instant, either at booksellers' stalls, in
taverns, two-penny rooms, tyring-houses, noblemen's butteries,
puisents chambers, (the best and farthest places where you are
admitted to come,) you shall once offer or dare (thereby to endear
yourself the more to any player, enghle, or guilty gull in your
company) to malign, traduce, or detract the person or writings of
Quintus Horatius Flaccus, or any other eminent men, transcending
you in merit, whom your envy shall find cause to work upon, either
for that, or for keeping himself in better acquaintance, or
enjoying better friends, or if, transported by any sudden and
desperate resolution, you do, that then you shall not under the
batoon, or in the next presence, being an honourable assembly of
his favourers, be brought as voluntary gentlemen to undertake the
for-swearing of it. Neither shall you, at any time, ambitiously
affecting the title of the Untrussers or Whippers of the age,
suffer the itch of writing to over-run your performance in libel,
upon pain of being taken up for lepers in wit, and, losing both
your time and your papers, be irrecoverably forfeited to the
hospital of fools. So help you our Roman gods and the Genius of
great Caesar.

Virg.
So! now dissolve the court.

Bor. Tib. Gal. Mec.
And thanks to Caesar, That thus hath exercised his patience.

Caes.
We have, indeed, you worthiest friends of Caesar.
It is the bane and torment of our ears,
To hear the discords of those jangling rhymers,
That with their bad and scandalous practices
Bring all true arts and learning in contempt.
But let not your high thoughts descend so low
As these despised objects; let them fall,
With their flat grovelling souls: be you yourselves;
And as with our best favours you stand crown'd,
So let your mutual loves be still renown'd.
Envy will dwell where there is want of merit,
Though the deserving man should crack his spirit.

Blush, folly, blush; here's none that fears
The wagging of an ass's ears,
Although a wolfish case he wears.
Detraction is but baseness' varlet;
And apes are apes, though clothed in scarlet.

                                    HORACE AND TREBATIUS.
                                                A DIALOGUE.
                                                Sat. 1. Lib. 2.

Hor.
There are to whom I seem excessive sour,
And past a satire's law t' extend my power:
Others, that think whatever I have writ
Wants pith and matter to eternise it;
And that they could, in one day's light, disclose
A thousand verses, such as I compose.
What shall I do, Trebatius? say.

Treb.
Surcease.

Hor.
And shall my muse admit no more increase?

Treb.
So I advise.

Hor.
An ill death let me die,
If 'twere not best; but sleep avoids mine eye,
And I use these, lest nights should tedious seem.

Treb.
Rather, contend to sleep, and live like them,
That, holding golden sleep in special price,
Rubb'd with sweet oils, swim silver Tyber thrice,
And every even with neat wine steeped be:
Or, if such love of writing ravish thee,
Then dare to sing unconquer'd Caesar's deeds;
Who cheers such actions with abundant meeds.

Hor.
That, father, I desire; but, when I try,
I feel defects in every faculty:
Nor is't a labour fit for every pen,
To paint the horrid troops of armed men,
The lances burst, in Gallia's slaughter'd forces;
Or wounded Parthians, tumbled from their horses:
Great Caesar's wars cannot be fought with words.

Treb.
Yet, what his virtue in his peace affords,
His fortitude and justice thou canst shew
As wise Lucilius honour'd Scipio.

Hor.
Of that, my powers shall suffer no neglect,
When such slight labours may aspire respect:
But, if I watch not a most chosen time,
The humble words of Flaccus cannot climb
Th' attentive ear of Caesar; nor must I
With less observance shun gross flattery:
For he, reposed safe in his own merit,
Spurns back the gloses of a fawning spirit.

Treb.
But how much better would such accents sound
Than with a sad and serious verse to wound
Pantolabus, railing in his saucy jests,
Or Nomentanus spent in riotous feasts?
In satires, each man, though untouch'd, complains
As he were hurt; and hates such biting strains.

Hor.
What shall I do? Milonius shakes his heels
In ceaseless dances, when his brain once feels
The stirring fervour of the wine ascend;
And that his eyes false numbers apprehend.
Castor his horse, Pollux loves handy-fights;
A thousand heads, a thousand choice delights.
My pleasure is in feet my words to close,
As, both our better, old Lucilius does:
He, as his trusty friends, his books did trust
With all his secrets; nor, in things unjust,
Or actions lawful, ran to other men:
So that the old man's life described, was seen
As in a votive table in his lines:
And to his steps my genius inclines;
Lucanian, or Apulian, I know not whether,
For the Venusian colony ploughs either;
Sent thither, when the Sabines were forced thence,
As old Fame sings, to give the place defence
'Gainst such as, seeing it empty, might make road
Upon the empire; or there fix abode:
Whether the Apulian borderer it were,
Or the Lucanian violence they fear.—-
But this my style no living man shall touch,
If first I be not forced by base reproach;
But like a sheathed sword it shall defend
My innocent life; for why should I contend
To draw it out, when no malicious thief
Robs my good name, the treasure of my life?
O Jupiter, let it with rust be eaten,
Before it touch, or insolently threaten
The life of any with the least disease;
So much I love, and woo a general peace.
But, he that wrongs me, better, I proclaim,
He never had assay'd to touch my fame.
For he shall weep, and walk with every tongue
Throughout the city, infamously sung.
Servius the praetor threats the laws, and urn,
If any at his deeds repine or spurn;
The witch Canidia, that Albutius got,
Denounceth witchcraft, where she loveth not;
Thurius the judge, doth thunder worlds of ill,
To such as strive with his judicial will.
All men affright their foes in what they may,
Nature commands it, and men must obey.
Observe with me: The wolf his tooth doth use,
The bull his horn; and who doth this infuse,
But nature? There's luxurious Scaeva; trust
His long-lived mother with him; his so just
And scrupulous right-hand no mischief will;
No more than with his heel a wolf will kill,
Or ox with jaw: marry, let him alone
With temper'd poison to remove the croan.
But briefly, if to age I destined be,
Or that quick death's black wings environ me;
If rich, or poor; at Rome; or fate command
I shall be banished to some other land;
What hue soever my whole state shall bear,
I will write satires still, in spite of fear.

Treb.
Horace, I fear thou draw'st no lasting breath;
And that some great man's friend will be thy death.

Hor.
What! when the man that first did satirise
Durst pull the skin over the ears of vice,
And make who stood in outward fashion clear,
Give place, as foul within; shall I forbear?
Did Laelius, or the man so great with fame,
That from sack'd Carthage fetch'd his worthy name,
Storm that Lucilius did Metellus pierce,
Or bury Lupus quick in famous verse?
Rulers and subjects, by whole tribes he checkt,
But virtue and her friends did still protect:
And when from sight, or from the judgment-seat,
The virtuous Scipio and wise Laelius met,
Unbraced, with him in all light sports they shared,
Till their most frugal suppers were prepared.
Whate'er I am, though both for wealth and wit
Beneath Lucilius I am pleased to sit;
Yet Envy, spite of her empoison'd breast,
Shall say, I lived in grace here with the best;
And seeking in weak trash to make her wound,
Shall find me solid, and her teeth unsound:
'Less learn'd Trebatius' censure disagree.

Treb.
No, Horace, I of force must yield to thee;
Only take heed, as being advised by me,
Lest thou incur some danger: better pause,
Than rue thy ignorance of the sacred laws;
There's justice, and great action may be sued
'Gainst such as wrong men's fames with verses lewd.

Hor.
Ay, with lewd verses, such as libels be,
And aim'd at persons of good quality:
I reverence and adore that just decree.
But if they shall be sharp, yet modest rhymes,
That spare men's persons, and but tax their crimes,
Such shall in open court find current pass,
Were Caesar judge, and with the maker's grace.

Treb.
Nay, I'll add more; if thou thyself, being clear,
Shall tax in person a man fit to bear
Shame and reproach, his suit shall quickly be
Dissolved in laughter, and thou thence set free.

                                                TO THE READER

If, by looking on what is past, thou hast deserved that name, I am
willing thou should'st yet know more, by that which follows, an
APOLOGETICAL DIALOGUE; which was only once spoken upon the stage and all the answer I ever gave to sundry impotent libels then cast out (and some yet remaining) against me, and this play. Wherein I take no pleasure to revive the times; but that posterity may make a difference between their manners that provoked me then, and mine that neglected them ever, For, in these strifes, and on such persons, were as wretched to affect a victory, as it is unhappy to be committed with them.

            Non annorum canities est laudanda, sed morum.
                                 SCENE, The Author's Lodgings.
                              Enter NASUTUS and POLYPOSUS.

Nas.
I pray You let' s go see him, how he looks
After these libels.

Pol.
O vex'd, vex'd, I warrant you.

Nas. Do you think so? I should be sorry for him,
If I found that.

Pol.
O, they are such bitter things,
He cannot choose.

Nas.
But, is he guilty of them?

Pol.
Fuh! that's no matter.

Nas.
No!

Pol.
No. Here's his lodging.
We'll steal upon him: or let's listen; stay.
He has a humour oft to talk t' himself.

Nas.
They are your manners lead me, not mine own.

[They come forward; the scene opens, and discovers the
Author in his study.

Aut.
The fates have not spun him the coarsest thread,
That (free from knots of perturbation)
Doth yet so live, although but to himself,
As he can safely scorn the tongues of slaves,
And neglect fortune, more than she can him.
It is the happiest thing this, not to be
Within the reach of malice; it provides
A man so well, to laugh off injuries;
And never sends him farther for his vengeance,
Than the vex'd bosom of his enemy.
I, now, but think how poor their spite sets off,
Who, after all their waste of sulphurous terms,
And burst-out thunder of their charged mouths,
Have nothing left but the unsavoury smoke
Of their black vomit, to upbraid themselves:
Whilst I, at whom they shot, sit here shot-free,
And as unhurt of envy, as unhit.

[Pol. and Nas. discover themselves.

Pol.
Ay, but the multitude they think not so, sir,
They think you hit, and hurt: and dare give out,
Your silence argues it in not rejoining
To this or that late libel.

Aut.
'Las, good rout!
I can afford them leave to err so still;
And like the barking students of Bears-college,
To swallow up the garbage of the time
With greedy gullets, whilst myself sit by,
Pleased, and yet tortured, with their beastly feeding.
'Tis a sweet madness runs along with them,
To think, all that are aim'd at still are struck:
Then, where the shaft still lights, make that the mark:
And so each fear or fever-shaken fool
May challenge Teucer's hand in archery.
Good troth, if I knew any man so vile,
To act the crimes these Whippers reprehend,
Or what their servile apes gesticulate,
I should not then much muse their shreds were liked;
Since ill men have a lust t' hear others' sins,
All good men have a zeal to hear sin shamed.
But when it is all excrement they vent,
Base filth and offal; or thefts, notable
As ocean-piracies, or highway-stands;
And not a crime there tax'd, but is their own,
Or what their own foul thoughts suggested to them;
And that, in all their heat of taxing others,
Not one of them but lives himself, if known,
Improbior satiram scribente cinaedo
What should I say more, than turn stone with wonder!

Nas.
I never saw this play bred all this tumult:
What was there in it could so deeply offend
And stir so many hornets?

Aut.
Shall I tell you?

Nas.
Yea, and ingeniously.

Aut.
Then, by the hope
Which I prefer unto all other objects,
I can profess, I never writ that piece
More innocent or empty of offence.
Some salt it had, but neither tooth nor gall,
Nor was there in it any circumstance
Which. in the setting down, I could suspect
Might be perverted by an enemy's tongue;
Only it had the fault to be call'd mine;
That was the crime.

Pol.
No! why, they say you tax'd
The law and lawyers, captains and the players,
By their particular names.

Aut.
It is not so.
I used no name. My books have still been taught
To spare the persons, and to speak the vices.
These are mere slanders, and enforced by such
As have no safer ways to men's disgraces.
But their own lies and loss of honesty:
Fellows of practised and most laxative tongues,
Whose empty and eager bellies, in the year,
Compel their brains to many desperate shifts,
(I spare to name them, for their wretchedness
Fury itself would pardon). These, or such,
Whether of malice, or of ignorance,
Or itch t' have me their adversary, I know not,
Or all these mixt; but sure I am, three years
They did provoke me with their petulant styles
On every stage: and I at last unwilling,
But weary, I confess, of so much trouble,
Thought I would try if shame could win upon 'em,'
And therefore chose Augustus Caesar's times,
When wit and area were at their height in Rome,
To shew that Virgil, Horace, and the rest
Of those great master-spirits, did not want
Detractors then, or practicers against them:
And by this line, although no parallel,
I hoped at last they would sit down and blush;
But nothing I could find more contrary.
And though the impudence of flies be great,
Yet this hath so provok'd the angry wasps,
Or, as you said, of the next nest, the hornets,
That they fly buzzing, mad, about my nostrils,
And, like so many screaming grasshoppers
Held by the wings, fill every ear with noise.
And what? those former calumnies you mention'd.
First, of the law: indeed I brought in Ovid
Chid by his angry father for neglecting
The study of their laws for poetry:
And I am warranted by his own words:

Saepe pater dixit, studium quid inutile tentas!
Maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes.

And in far harsher terms elsewhere, as these:

Non me verbosas leges ediscere, non me
Ingrato voces prostituisse foro.

But how this should relate unto our laws,
Or the just ministers, with least abuse,
I reverence both too much to understand!
Then, for the captain, I will only speak
An epigram I here have made: it is

UNTO TRUE SOLDIERS.
That's the lemma: mark it.
Strength of my country, whilst I bring to view
Such: as are miss-call'd captains, and wrong you,
And your high names; I do desire, that thence,
Be nor put on you, nor you take offence:
I swear by your true friend, my muse, I love
Your great profession which I once did prove;
And did not shame it with my actions then,
No more than I dare now do with my pen.
He that not trusts me, having vowed thus much,
But's angry for the captain, still: is such.
Now for the players, it is true, I tax'd them,
And yet but some; and those so sparingly,
As all the rest might have sat still unquestion'd,
Had they but had the wit or conscience
To think well of themselves. But impotent, they
Thought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe;
And much good do't them! What they have done 'gainst me,
I am not moved with: if it gave them meat,
Or got them clothes, 'tis well; that was their end.
Only amongst them, I am sorry for
Some better natures, by the rest so drawn,
To run in that vile line.

Pol.
And is this all!
Will you not answer then the libels?

Aut.
No.

Pol.
Nor the Untrussers?

Aut.
Neither.

Pol.
Y'are undone then.

Aut.
With whom?

Pol.
The world.

Aut.
The bawd!

Pol.
It will be taken
To be stupidity or tameness in you.

Aut.
But they that have incensed me, can in soul
Acquit me of that guilt. They know I dare
To spurn or baffle them, or squirt their eyes
With ink or urine; or I could do worse,
Arm'd with Archilochus' fury, write Iambics,
Should make the desperate lashers hang themselves;
Rhime them to death, as they do Irish rats
In drumming tunes. Or, living, I could stamp
Their foreheads with those deep and public brands,
That the whole company of barber-surgeon a
Should not take off with all their art and plasters.
And these my prints should last, still to be read
In their pale fronts; when, what they write 'gainst me
Shall, like a figure drawn in water, fleet,
And the poor wretched papers be employed
To clothe tobacco, or some cheaper drug:
This I could do, and make them infamous.
But, to what end? when their own deeds have mark'd 'em;
And that I know, within his guilty breast
Each slanderer bears a whip that shall torment him
Worse than a million of these temporal plagues:
Which to pursue, were but a feminine humour,
And far beneath the dignity of man.

Nas.
'Tis true; for to revenge their injuries,
Were to confess you felt them. Let them go,
And use the treasure of the fool, their tongues,
Who makes his gain, by speaking worst of beat.

Pol.
O, but they lay particular imputations—

Aut.
As what?

Pol.
That all your writing is mere railing.

Aut.
Ha?
If all the salt in the old comedy
Should be so censured, or the sharper wit
Of the bold satire termed scolding rage,
What age could then compare with those for buffoons?
What should be said of Aristophanes,
Persius, or Juvenal, whose names we now
So glorify in schools, at least pretend it?—-
Have they no other?

Pol.
Yes; they say you are slow,
And scarce bring forth a play a year.

Aut.
'Tis true.
I would they could not say that I did that!
There' s all the joy that I take in their trade,
Unless such scribes as these might be proscribed
Th' abused theatres. They would think it strange, now,
A man should take but colts-foot for one day,
And, between whiles, spit out a better poem
Than e'er the master of art, or giver of wit,
Their belly, made. Yet, this is possible,
If a free mind had but the patience,
To think so much together and so vile.
But that these base and beggarly conceits
Should carry it, by the multitude of voices,
Against the most abstracted work, opposed
To the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout!
O, this would make a learn'd and liberal soul
To rive his stained quill up to the back,
And damn his long-watch'd labours to the fire,
Things that were born when none but the still night
And his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes,
Were not his own free merit a more crown
Unto his travails than their reeling claps.
This 'tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips,
And apts me rather to sleep out my time,
Than I would waste it in contemned strifes
With these vile Ibides, these unclean birds,
That make their mouths their clysters, and still purge
From their hot entrails. But I leave the monsters
To their own fate. And, since the Comic Muse
Hath proved so ominous to me, I will try
If TRAGEDY have a more kind aspect;
Her favours in my next I will pursue,
Where, if I prove the pleasure but of one,
So he judicious be, he shall be alone
A theatre unto me; Once I'll say
To strike the ear of time in those fresh strains,
As shall, beside the cunning of their ground,
Give cause to some of wonder, some despite,
And more despair, to imitate their sound.
I, that spend half my nights, and all my days,
Here in a cell, to get a dark paleface,
To come forth worth the ivy or the bays,
And in this age can hope no other grace—-
Leave me! There's something come into my thought,
That must and shall be sung high and aloof,
Safe from the wolfs black jaw, and the dun ass's hoof

Nas.
I reverence these raptures, and obey them.

When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive

A strange new perfume blows
And the lightning flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows

He got a big smile, he's fake news
Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover
Run
Run
Run for cover"
LegendaryWelshly Arms,"[Verse 1]
Take a look around me
Taking pages from a magazine
Been looking for the answers
Ever since we were seventeen
You know the truth can be a weapon
To fight this world of ill intentions
A new answer to the same question
How many times will you learn the same lesson?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think they got it all wrong
We just gotta hold on
And on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
'Cause we're gonna be legends (Ooh)
Gonna get their attention (Ooh)
What we're doing here ain't just scary
It's about to be legendary
Yeah, we're gonna be legends (Ooh)
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson (Ooh)
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
It's about to be legendary

[Verse 2]
This is what we came for
And we couldn't want it anymore
We could never turn back now
Got to leave it all on the floor
Been dreaming of the payoff
Through the struggles and the trade-offs
Fighting tooth and nail on the way up
Tell them the truth, but they think it's just made up

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think they got it all wrong
We just gotta hold on
And on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
'Cause we're gonna be legends (Legends)
Gonna get their attention (Attention)
What we're doing here ain't just scary
It's about to be legendary
Yeah, we're gonna be legends (Legends)
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson (Lesson)
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
It's about to be legendary

[Bridge]
Eventually, they're gonna know who's right
To make a stand, you've got to win the fight
Can't stand the heat, then just stay out the light
For you might never make it out alive
You gotta live without a compromise
Let everybody hear your battle cry

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, we're gonna be legends (Legends)
Gonna get their attention (Attention)
What we're doing here ain't just scary

I Don't Want U BackBORNS,"[Verse 1]
Well, it was last week
And you ran out of the house
I heard his sparkomatic
And when you came back
I felt you losing touch
I knew you couldn't be trusted

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've known better when you're coming to bed at four in the morning
I should've taken your eyes avoiding mine as a warning
Every time I ask you, ""What's up baby?"" you're changing your story
Just so you know that when you go I ain’t begging for you back

[Chorus]
I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back
I don’t want you back

[Verse 2]
Another year passed
Another Friday night
You showed up at the disco
And when we caught eyes
The room started to spin
And my heart nearly busted

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've known better but the liquor got me thinking I miss ya
I should've taken two steps back but I wanted to kiss ya
Every time you flash those eyes you make me reminisce ya
You’re looking fine, but I'd be lying, if I said I wanted you back

[Chorus]
I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back
I don’t want you back

The bigger the lies the harder they fall
The hotter the fire, the faster the love is gonna burn up
The hotter the fire, the smoke and the mirrors
Its clear I'm better off without ya

[Chorus]
I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back
I don’t want you back

[Outro]
Heartbeats
Are made of honesty
And all this time wasn't just you and me
It's sad to say, I’m glad you left
I don't want you back

And we were never supposed to make it half this far
And I lived so much life, lived so much life
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx
I woke up in my shoes again but somewhere you exist singing

[Chorus]
Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace

[Breakdown (Chopped Sample)]
Young and a menace

[Verse 2]
Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived

[Chorus]
Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace

[Breakdown (Chopped Sample)]
Young and a menace

[Bridge]
I’m just here flying off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the... For the...

PhotographDef Leppard,"Huh!
I'm outa luck, outa love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch
I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh Oh, look what you've done

Photograph - I don't want your
Photograph - I don't need your
Photograph - All I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child
You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, Look what you've done to this rock'n'roll clown
Oh Oh, Look what you've done

You've gone straight to my head"
ZombieBad Wolves,"[Verse 1]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Pre-Chorus]
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the same old theme in 2018
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?

One look from you
And I'm on that faded love
Out of my body

I'd give it to you

But I'm a missile that's guided to you

Thunder/Young Dumb & Broke (Medley)Imagine Dragons + Khalid,"[Verse 1: Khalid]
So you're still thinking of me, just like I know you should
I cannot give you everything, you know I wish I could

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, I wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yessir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

We have so much in common, we argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure I'm right
They say you're basic, they say you're easy

Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds...

Sunshine RiptideFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]
I don't even have my own attention
You say, ""Please don't ever change""
But you don't like me the way I am

The sign says ""Don't you tap the glass""
But I read it in reverse
""eht pat uoy t'nod syas ngis ehT""

The world tried to burn all the mercy out of me
But you know I wouldn't let it
It tried to teach me the hard way
I can't forget it

Driving down the coast again
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in

She said, ""I love you 'til I don't""
I am just playing house
No idea what I'm doing now

There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's getting to me
It's time to throw in the towel

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright
The sunshine

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]
Call me Oluwaburna
I fell in love but I didn't fall down
Them say me nah normal
Drink Hennessy, me nah drink water
Make me stumble pon me Air Jordan

Ain't no slowing down, know I keep it rolling now
Smoking in my fuckin' brain
Passing through my fuckin' mind
Feel like I'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby
With the sun shining through
Got the blunt and the juice, cruise
Ridin' through the...

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
The sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright

Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I-I'm stuck in...)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun

[Verse 3: Patrick Stump]
You are my truest feeling yet
I love you so much, it's just like oxygen
And it's going to my head
A public meltdown, petulant but irreverent

Take all your possibilities then take away the limits
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
I do the best with what I have
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide (The sunshine)
You came back like a wave when I was feeling al- (-right)

I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light

You came back like a wave when I was feeling al- (-right)

I'm sifting through sand, sand, sand, sand
Looking for pieces of broken hourglass
Trying to get it all back
Put it back together
As if the time had never passed
I know I should walk away, know I should walk away
But I just want to let you break my brain
And I can't seem to get a grip
No matter how I live with it

These are the last blues, yeah
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we'll get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left

The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last

Mystery Of LoveSufjan Stevens,"[Verse 1]
Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me

[Chorus 1]
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

[Verse 2]
Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

[Verse 3]
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed?
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath

[Chorus 3]
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love"

You Worry MeNathaniel Rateliff,"[Verse 1]
I'm alright today
You gonna find a way to cross and you gonna get there
And I'm on fire today
Ain't no water here to calm or even put me out
I'll find a better way
Am I crazy or the wind is gonna blow me down?

Were you up all night afraid of what the future might bring?
I feel fine today
I had dreams of you in places I've not seen before
You get so carried away

This ain't a getaway
You build walls around your heart to try to lock it in

I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry
I'm gonna leave it all out there
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I'm gonna leave it all out there

Over the cities and the plains
You got time you're on the mend babe
And everybody wants the same

We FightDashboard Confessional,"[Verse 1]
We were the kids that left home probably too young
But we took our share and maybe then some
Tired of beatings and battles and being sewn up
But that made us grow up, and that made 'em scared

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in

So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out

We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out

That somebody cares, that somebody knows
Who's tired of bleeding and battered and being torn up
Just pick yourself up, it's time to go

'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out

So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out

We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out

Maybe we found a way to make some tracks
We didn't snicker and turn our backs
We just keep digging in, and digging in, and giving back

'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up

And we fight our way out

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise

In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

Fix YouColdplay,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus: Chris & Will, Chris]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Don't know what to say to you now

We've got to let go

The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine

Tried to call you, to feel you close
From a runway in Tokyo
Let's leave the atmosphere, disappear
There's always something left to lose

But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
I wanna give you wild love

[Bridge]

Let's be reckless, unaffected
Running out until we're breathless
Let's be hopeful, don't be broken
Let's stay caught up in the moment

But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
Oh I said I wanna give you wild love

Give you wild love
Wild love

The MountainThree Days Grace,"[Intro]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

[Verse 1]
Another night I'm barely holdin' on
One step away from being dead and gone
Am I alive to die another day?
Is this life that I've been livin' all that's meant for me?

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

[Verse 2]
The higher I go, the harder I fall
So I don't look down, I don't look back at all
And when I wish it all would turn to black
I try to see the light and push the darkness back

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', I keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

[Bridge]
So if I'm not already too far gone
And if I feel a pulse then I can carry on
When I'm lost and wanna fade away
I tell myself to live, to die another day

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still alive and keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain, the mountain"

If you can hold on
If you can hold on, hold on

I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man

Something about the way that you walked into my living room

So tired of sleepin' alone
So tired of eatin' alone
I need to ask her what's goin' on
Are we goin' strong?

The long drive, the coastline
Lookin' out at first light
Am I still on her mind?
I've been undone

Two worlds collide
And they could never, ever tear us apart

But if I hurt you, I'd make wine from your tears
Oh, I told you that we could fly
'Cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know why

Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart, oh, oh, oh
And they could never, ever tear us apart, oh, oh, oh

Just Like ParadiseO.A.R.,"[Verse 1]
After all the clouds have gone
We can get together
She mixes the pineapple with dark rum
Says it’s because of the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re burning in the sunshine
She squeezes the lime
As the DJ on the stereo dropped the bassline
She told me she’s in love
With the speaker and the sub
And reggae makes her crazy

[Chorus]
Maybe it’s your eyes, how they pull me in
Maybe it’s your skin, either way I win
I don’t even know where to begin, girl
You’re just like paradise
All around the world they look for this
A little bit of sun and a pretty miss
Here I got you both I can’t resist, girl
Just like paradise

She called me up when my watch read one
Waiting in the lobby (you know what she wants to do)
The weekend is here and the work is done
She just wants to party

We’re burning in the sunshine
She squeezes the lime
As the DJ on the stereo dropped the bassline
She told me she’s in love
With the speaker and the sub
And reggae makes her crazy

Maybe it’s your eyes, how they pull me in
Maybe it’s your skin, either way I win

Here I got you both I can’t resist, girl

Plan every minute of our whole lives
We used to talk about it all night

A little bit of sun and a pretty miss
Oh, there’s nothing that you need to fix, girl

I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

[Verse 1]
Started with a little bit
Now I don't know how to quit
Always feel inadequate
Same way that my daddy did
Mama told me not to try
And I should have taken her advice
And now I'm all twisted
When it's all gone, I miss it

I'll try just to do somethin'
I'll try 'cause I got nothin'

I won't quit

Then you stopped lettin' me walk

You could be another face that I forget soon as I move along

Kick my shoes off and run (run, we'll be running barefoot)
Kick my shoes off and run

It's time for moving on
There's some things you can't forget
It's sinking us like a stone
I just wanna bury it

[Chorus]
I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

[Post-Chorus]
Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

[Verse 2]
Out into the unknown
We traded in our regrets
Not gonna go alone
'Cause we're gonna finish this

[Chorus]
I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

[Bridge]
Burn it all, set me free
And let the smoke blow on out to the sea
I need to find somewhere I can believe
I need to know there's a chance we can be
Burn it all, set me free
And let the smoke blow on out to the sea
I need to find somewhere I can believe
I need to know there's a chance we can be

[Chorus]
I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

[Post-Chorus]
Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo"
DevilShinedown,"[Intro]
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick up the phone

[Verse 1]
You said it yourself you're scared of being alone
You said it yourself that you can crack the code
But the static you hear automatically keeps you exposed, on your own
I hope you're ready, steady, smashing through the levy
The drama, the trauma, don't play the prima donna
My God
You said it yourself that you would never stop
Until you felt the needle drop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you pack your bags, the party's such a drag
And everyone can tell that you're poisoning the well
But there are no mistakes, except what you create
You need to know your place

[Chorus]
'Cause it's about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
It's about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room

[Verse 2]
The silence, the silence
The blinding ultra violence
Knockin' at your door (Hey)
Pacin' back and forth
What now? (What now)
The whispers and the screams
The stereotypical profiling ritual
Vicious and obscene

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you pack your bags, the party's such a drag
And everyone can tell that you're poisoning the well
But there are no mistakes, except what you create
You need to know your place

[Chorus]
'Cause it's about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
It's about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
'Cause it's about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
It's about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room

[Outro]
(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah the devil's in the next room
(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah the devil's in the next room
(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's right beside you"
BulletproofGodsmack,"[Verse 1]
Contemplating, isolating
And it's stressing me out
Different visions, contradictions
Why won't you let me out?
I need a way to separate
But I promised you that I'll make sure you never forget me
(Never forget me)

[Chorus]
Now that you want it
Now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof(Bulletproof)
Believe me, I'm bulletproof(Bulletproof)
You make me so bulletproof(Bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone

[Verse 2]
You're addicted and so twisted
That it's freaking me out
Distant eyes, it's no surprise
You can't do anything now
I need a way to separate
But I'm telling you that nothing will ever be the same

[Chorus]
Now that you want it
Now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof(Bulletproof)
Believe me, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
You make me so bulletproof (Bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone

[Chorus/Outro]
(Now that you want it)
(Now that you need it)
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
Believe me, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
You make me so bulletproof (Bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
Believe me, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
You make me so bulletproof (Bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone"
PsychoBreaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
Into the bottom I will go
I feel the daylight choking
Into the vile I become
I am forever changing

[Chorus]
In the cold eternal light
I am the ember fading
Every scar we try to hide
I am the fake you made me

[Verse 2]
Into the hollow I let go
I see the darkness closing
Into the silence I become
I am the faith forsaking

[Chorus]
In the cold eternal light
I am the ember fading
Every scar we try to hide
I am the fake you made me
Psycho, let go
I am the warm embracing
Psycho, faithful
I am the rupture breaking

[Chorus]
In the cold eternal light
I am the ember fading
Every scar we try to hide
I am the fake you make me
Psycho, let go
I am the warm embracing
Psycho, faithful
I am the rupture breaking"

I’m a sinner, I will consider
I am my father’s son
I'm a sinner, I must consider
I've never owned a gun
I’m a sinner, seasoned beginner
Lucky to be alive
I’m a sinner, finished my dinner
Now I can go outside

[Chorus]
If only yesterday took place tomorrow
I’d pray for sleep
And wake you and lift your head
So I can fix your hand
I’ll be your handyman (Handyman)

[Verse 2]
I’m not brittle, I’m just a little scared of your temperament
I’m not brittle, I’m just a little scared of my government
I’m not brittle, head hurts a little
Staring up overhead
I’m not brittle, I’m just a riddle
Born of white, blue and red

If only yesterday took place tomorrow
I'd pray for sleep
And wake you and lift your head

The Sisyphean dreamer
My fibula and femur
Hold the weight of the world
(Over and over)
I think, therefore I die
Anxiety and I, rolling down a mountain
(Over and over)

My shoulder holds the weight of the world

[Chorus]
Yeah, the wind is blowing
Volcanoes blowing, my lungs are blowing

Who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
With no sign of a grave

Hollow body
Wine belly perfidy
Move like Isotta Fraschini

The rock 'n' roller, the young and older
Rolling back to the stroller

And although you warned me
The gods have all scorned me now

Volcanoes blowing, my lungs are blowing

Who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
With no sign of a grave

And I'm punished for the passion
Only telling 'cause you're asking
And I'm a glutton for the tasking

And the lovers are drowning
And they're never gonna find 'em
'Cause their ego's gonna blind 'em

Woo!

Yeah, my shoulder on a boulder
Holds the weight of the world

One Track MindThirty Seconds To Mars,"[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Love is like problems, we all got 'em

[Verse 1: Jared Leto]
A dark night, remember, the sunrise, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Hands tied, remember, it's suicide to surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, I have a one track-mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

[Verse 2: Jared Leto]
Sex and lies, remember, look in my eyes, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Outta luck, outta time, outta sight, I'm outta mind, mind

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, I have a one-track mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Float around town, made it official now
Think about you every now and again
There's been times, spendin days when I'm with you, girl
On my downtime, locking in, I take a ride around downtown
I'm not in the right town, come alive in the nighttime
Wasn't the right state, wasn't the right mind
Love is like problems, we all got 'em
How come when you stop a problem
Everybody problems become your problem?
Let 'em cry 'bout it, ain't my problem
Ain't my fault, Mystikal, Silkk the Shocker
Heard it's only thirty seconds to Mars
And it took you even less just to get to my heart

[Outro: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, method to the madness
One track-mind, method to the madness
One track-mind, method to the madness
One track-mind"
House On FireRise Against,"[Short Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, ""Move!""
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 2]
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 3]
And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

[Chorus]
'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I can't let go of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you"
Hurt SomebodyNoah Kahan,"[Verse 1]
Taking it slowly
I'm afraid to be lonely
Nobody told me
It's harder than I thought to tell the truth
It's gonna leave you in pieces
All alone with your demons
And I know that we need this
But I've been too afraid to follow through

[Chorus]
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

[Verse 2]
Don't know where the time went
Stuck in the wrong mindset
I let the rules bend
When I know that all along they're made to break
You got me searching for reasons
To keep me from leaving
At night I have trouble breathing
I give myself another chance to stay

[Chorus]
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

[Bridge]
One day before you know it, you will see
All of the pain and all the irony
You'll feel the stinging and you'll think of me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt

[Chorus]
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody"
CelebrateDirty Heads,"[Chorus: The Unlikely Candidates]
Mom if you can hear me, I think I made it
20,000 fans from the stage I'm standing on
I want you to know I appreciate it
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate
Mom I gotta go, the curtain's calling
All the way from Rome, I'm really sorry
Tell my little sister I said hey
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate

[Verse 1: Duddy B]
Yeah these late nights and these long drives
Full moon under dark skies
Tears fall behind phone screens
Lonely hearts lead to bad dreams
Wish that I could be there for you
I hope that life will be fair for you
It's hard to sleep cause I'm always thinking
And passing out off of codeine
And I hope you know that I'm not complaining
Hope you know I appreciate it
Every day is just filled with love
Man every day is just thanks and praises
But memories of your birthday, they get me in the worst ways
When you say, ""dad, it's okay.""
When you get home we can celebrate

[Chorus: The Unlikely Candidates]
Mom if you can hear me, I think I made it
20,000 fans from the stage I'm standing on
I want you to know I appreciate it
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate
Mom I gotta go, the curtain's calling
All the way from Rome, I'm really sorry
Tell my little sister I said hey
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate

[Verse 2: Dirty J]
Not the money, not the fame
Love the struggle, love the pain
After all that we have gained
We realize we're all the same
Sacrifice my brothers cried
We've been gone when family died
Losing my focus, symphonies open
Singing my opus, just think for a moment
One day I'll get home and we can throw a big party
Invite other people that helped us get started to
To all of you artists that feel a martyr
Don't ever give up, you just gotta go harder

[Chorus: The Unlikely Candidates]
Mom if you can hear me, I think I made it
20,000 fans from the stage I'm standing on
I want you to know I appreciate it
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate
Mom I gotta go, the curtain's calling
All the way from Rome, I'm really sorry
Tell my little sister I said hey
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate

[Bridge: The Unlikely Candidates]
Every night feels like another weekend
Keep pretending that it's easy
Sold my soul for a wrecking ball
I shot at the moon but I mostly fall

[Chorus: The Unlikely Candidates]
Mom if you can hear me, I think I made it
20,000 fans from the stage I'm standing on
I want you to know I appreciate it
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate
Mom I gotta go, the curtain's calling
All the way from Rome, I'm really sorry
Tell my little sister I said hey
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate"

Walking On WaterNEEDTOBREATHE,"[Intro]
The wind is strong, the water's deep
My heart is heavy and my mind won't sleep
Oh can you heal? my fear it breathes
I need to know if You're the shadow I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run to You when the waves break through
I wanna run to You and not turn back

[Chorus]
There's no turning back
Nothing in the past
My eyes are on You again
Can't see nothing at all
But Your outstretched arms
Help me believe it
Though I falter
You got me walking on water

[Verse]
The ocean's singing, the song of grace
But if I'm honest with myself I, am still afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run to You when the waves break through
I'm gonna run to You and not turn back

[Chorus]
There's no turning back
Nothing in the past
My eyes are on You again
Can't see nothing at all
But Your outstretched arms
Help me believe it
Though I falter
You got me walking on water

[Bridge]
I was sinking like a stone again
I was halfway in the grave and then
I looked up and saw Your face again
You pulled me out of the water, water, water

[Chorus]
There's no turning back
Nothing in the past
My eyes are on You again
Can't see nothing at all
But Your outstretched arms
Help me believe it
Though I falter
You got me walking on water
Though I falter
You got me walking on water, water, water

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
You got me walking on water, water, water, water"
Can't Deny MePearl Jam,"And now you want me to breathe
And be so grateful
For the air that I need
Don't make me pitiful
And in the morning light
We're just the same, you and me
Out on the go, send officials
My propensity to breed

The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You might be rich, but you can't deny me
Got nothin', got nothin' but the will to survive
You can't control and you can't deny me
Your lies are sick, they're sick and they're vile
You can't deny me

Try to talk down to me
My mind it ain't so simple
Where's your vocabulary?
Your ignorance is sinful
You plant your lying seeds
Watch as the roots take hold
The country you are now poisoning
Condition critical

The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
I know it's true and you can't deny me
Got nothin', got nothin', you got nothin' to hide
Little bullshit whore, and you can't deny me
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
It's all so sick and you can't deny me

You can't deny me
You can't deny me
You don't defy me
You can't deny me

The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You know you're sick and you can't deny me
Got nothin', just nothin', you got somethin' to hide
We see right through you and you can't deny me

Darkness, darkness, darkness and light
You can't deny me"
Such A Simple ThingRay LaMontagne,"[Verse 1]
Tell me what you're feeling
I can take the pain
Tell me that you mean it
That you won't leave again

[Chorus]
Tell me what your heart wants
Such a simple thing
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame
I can't make you see
If you don't by now
I'll get through these changes
Somehow, somehow

[Verse 2]
Take it if you want it
I'm so tired I just don't care
Can't you see how much you hurt me?
It's like I wasn't there

[Chorus]
Tell me what your heart wants
Such a simple thing
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame
I can't make you see
If you don't by now
I'll get through these chains
Somehow, somehow

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Tell me what your heart wants
Such a simple thing
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame"
UnstoppableThe Score,"[Verse 1]
There's a moment
In your bones when
When the fire takes over
Blood is running
Heart is pumping
As the battle gets closer
Ooh, they can say what they want now
Ooh, 'cause we'll be screaming out

[Chorus]
We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want

We can be heroes everywhere we go
Keeping us down is impossible
'Cause we're unstoppable

[Post-Chorus]
Oh whoa, we're unstoppable
Oh whoa, we're unstoppable

Wanting it more
Than anybody against us
Ooh, they can say what they want now
Ooh, 'cause we'll be screaming out

[Chorus]
We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want
Swinging like Ali, knocking out bodies

We can be heroes everywhere we go
Keeping us down is impossible
'Cause we're unstoppable

Ooh, they can say what they want now

Pink LemonadeJames Bay,"[Verse 1]
Don't fall into my arms
Don't ask me to repeat it
Don't suffocate my heart
I don't know what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
""Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?""
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you
Don't ask me
""Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?""
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you
Don't ask me

Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

[Bridge]
Let me wake up heavy head
Lying in my bed with you naked
Go put that song on, that you love
On repeat, until we can't take it
I wanna drink pink lemonade
Watching movie trailers 'til it's late
And let's remember all the words
That we think are gonna make our hearts break

[Chorus]
Don't ask me
""Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?""
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you
Don't ask me
""Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?""
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

I'm protecting you to what I don't wanna have to say
I'm protecting you, I'm protecting you
I'm protecting us 'cause I don't wanna walk away

You
Thinking of you
I'm just thinking of you
Thinking of you"
White FlagBishop Briggs,"[Verse 1]
Take a hit, shoot me down, shoot me down
I will never hit the ground, hit the ground
Playing dead, I'll never do
Gotta keep an eye on you
Patience is wearing thin, paper-thin
Promises broke again, what a sin
But it only feeds my energy
So don't expect no sympathy

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke, fire, it's all goin' up
Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood?
Smoke, fire, flares are goin' up, flares are goin' up

[Chorus]
Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
This time I won't let go
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
Oh, I won't go down slow
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
Put an X on my chest, on my chest
But I'm still standing cause I won't forget
The hell on earth you put me through
I'll save myself in spite of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke, fire, it's all goin' up
Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood?
Smoke, fire, flares are goin' up, flares are goin' up

[Chorus]
Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
This time I won't let go
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight

I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

Sky Full Of SongFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
How deeply are you sleeping or are you still awake?
A good friend told me you've been staying out so late
Be careful, oh, my darling, oh, be careful what it takes
From what I've seen so far, the good ones always seem to break
And I was screaming at my father and you were screaming at me
And I can feel your anger from way across the sea
And I was kissing strangers, I was causing such a scene
Oh, the heart it hides such unimaginable things

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

[Verse 2]
And I can tell that I'm in trouble when that music starts to play
In a city without seasons, it keeps raining in LA
I feel like I'm about to fall, the room begins to sway
And I can hear the sirens but I cannot walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

[Bridge]
I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (Shoot, shoot, shoot)
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (Fire)

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm too tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (Shoot, shoot, shoot)
And take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (Fire)"

RatsGhost,"[Verse 1: Cardinal Copia]
In times of turmoil, in times like these
Beliefs contagious, spreading disease
This wretched mischief is now coursing through your souls
Never to let go, never to let go

[Bridge: Cardinal Copia]
Them rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)

Into your sanctum, you let them in

Never to forgive, never to forgive

Favorite Color Is BlueRobert DeLong + K.Flay,"[Verse 1]
Locked up, naked with socks
I'm watching the phone ring
It's making me angry
It's making me mad

Maxed out, minimum wage
My brain is a time bomb
I'm saying goodbye, Mom
I'll see you again

Striking a pose
Smiling in photos without any reason
With people that I'll never know
I'm outta control, living a fictional prose
I took an oath, it's killing me though
'Cause I don't believe in the things that I do

[Chorus]
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite

[Verse 2]
Roped up, rat in a cage
I'm having a breakdown
Drinking at a playground, tequila for one
Too short, walking the streets, I'm hating my haircut
You say that you're here, but
You live on the Sun

Burning a kite
I'm at a funeral, nothing unusual
Baby, I do what I like
Looking to fight, smoking a blunt and a pipe
Taking a bite, worm in the apple
I knew what would happen, 'cause honey the vermin survive
Swerve to the side, been driving all night

I'm thinking of changing my name, thinking of wrecking a home
'Cause loving and hating are one and the same
And I'm feeling like everyone's feeling alone
I'm just looking for something to soften the blow
A second inside of the truth
I don't see red 'cause

[Chorus 2]
Now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue

[Outro]
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue"
SorryNothing But Thieves,"[Verse 1]
You might kill me with desire
Wind me tighter than a wire
It's something that you do to me
I run away like mercury
And I know you think it's rough
When you're tryna patch us up
And I say, ""Honey, what is love?""
You just say I drink too much

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm defective
Or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

[Verse 2]
And on the t-shirt that I wear
Pick the thorns out of my hair
I broke your heart so carelessly
But made the pieces part of me
And now it hurts what we've become
'Cause you taught me how to love
It's me who taught you how to stop
And you just say I drink too much

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm defective
Or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

[Bridge]
I've waited for this
I'm ready for it
I've waited for this
I'm ready for it
I've been waiting so long

I've waited for this
I'm ready for it
I've waited for this
I'm ready for it
I've been waiting so long

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm defective
Or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done"
Sham PainFive Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
I never cared about the money, never really needed fame
You think it would've changed me but I've always been the same
My label tried to sue me, TMZ tried to screw me,
Blabbermouth can fuckin' suck it 'cause they never fuckin' knew me!
Everybody seems like they're waiting for me to die
Talk shit behind my back, can't look me in the eye!
They say I'm overrated, that I should've already faded;
Give a shit about it all because I love to be so hated

[Chorus]
All in all it's a good life; I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (It's all sham pain)

[Verse 2]
I barely get to eat and when I finally get to sleep
I get drug out of bed for another meet-and-greet
I shake the hand of every fan, put on a happy face;
Spread so fuckin' thin I'm all over the place
I hate riding on the bus, I hate flying in the planes;
Sedate myself just to kill the pain
I have no life, forgot the hope;
The whole thing's turned into one big joke

[Chorus]
All in all it's a good life; I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (It's all sham pain)

[Verse 3]
I mean no disrespect, but I ain't picking up the check
Takin' selfies on your phone while you're breathing down my neck
Is getting pretty fuckin' old, and I'm almost nearly done;
I'm glad that you were happier when I was number one

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
It's all sham pain

[Chorus]
All in all it's a good life; I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (It's all sham pain)"

And the word was death
And the word was without light
The new beatitude:
""Good luck, you're on your own""

[Verse 2]
Blessed are the fornicates
May we bend down to be their whores
Blessed are the rich
May we labor, deliver them more
Blessed are the envious
Bless the slothful, the wrathful, the vain
Blessed are the gluttonous
May they feast us to famine and war

[Chorus]
What of the pious, the pure of heart, the peaceful?
What of the meek, the mourning, and the merciful?
All doomed
All doomed

[Verse 3]
Behold a new Christ
Behold the same old horde
Gather at the altering
New beginning, new word
And the word was death
And the word was without light
The new beatitude: ""Good luck...""

[Chorus]
What of the pious, the pure of heart, the peaceful?
What of the meek, the mourning, and the merciful?
What of the righteous? What of the charitable?
What of the truthful, the dutiful, the decent?

[Outro]
Doomed are the poor
Doomed are the peaceful
Doomed are the meek
Doomed are the merciful
For the word is now death
And the word is now without light
The new beatitude:
""Fuck the doomed, you're on your own"""
I Hope You're HappyBlue October,"There will be days when you're falling down

Dopamine
On dopamine
On dopamine
On dope

[Verse 1]
We have been overrun by our animal desire
Addicts of the immediate keep us obedient and unaware
Feeding this mutation, this Pavlovian despair

[Pre-Chorus]
We've become
Disillusioned
So we run
Towards anything glimmering

[Chorus]
Time to put the silicon obsession down
Take a look around
Find a way in the silence
Lie supine away with your back to the ground
Dis- and re-connect to the resonance now
You were never an island
Unique
Voice among the many
In this choir
Tuning
Into each other
Lift all higher

Willingly been re-wired by clever agents within
Looping our reflections, our obsessions draw us in
Fix and fixation, no sentience beyond

We've become
Disillusioned
So we dive like crows
Towards anything glittering

Time to put the silicon obsession down

Wait By The RiverLord Huron,"[Verse 1]
I will wait by the river
In the light of the moon
At the edge of the city
I will wait for you
Though I can't wait forever
Someday I'll be dead and gone
And I won't be forgiven
For what I've done

[Hook]
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river

[Verse 2]
I will cry out to heaven
As it rains down on me
I will beg for forgiveness
Get down on my knees
If I can't change the weather
Maybe I can change your mind
If we can't be together
What's the point of life

[Bridge]
Baby, I didn't mean the things I said
I don't honestly wish you were dead
I'm a fool; I'm just a man
If I only could hold you again

[Verse 3]
And the stars fill the river
As it flows into the sky
And the mind leaves the body
And floats higher and higher
If we can't be together
I will leave this world behind
If I can't touch your body
Can I touch the sky?

[Hook]
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river"
Don't Give InSnow Patrol,"[Chorus]
Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever
I know, I know

[Verse 1]
It's in your blood and it's in your making
So don't hold your tongue
'Cause it's, it's no longer working
Don't fall on your sword
Just follow your instinct
Like an old lesson learned
Like an old lesson learned

Only you know what it, what it is to see through
See through the eyes that are trained on me now
I can, I can only tell you how it, how it looks from here
I think you've made up your mind
I think you've made up your mind

[Chorus]
Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever
I know, I know
Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever
I know, I know

[Verse 2]
Yes there's a lot we can
We can learn from this loss
Learn not to let it fall around our ears
Don't fall in love with the, with the way things were
It'll fuck up your mind, it'll fuck up your mind
But this is all on the wings of others
I loved you more
More in your own flight
So it ain't the same
It won't be lost forever
It won't be lost forever

[Chorus]
Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever
I know, I know
Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever

And I don't know why, and I don't know why
This is your grace
And I don't know why, and I don't know why

Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever

Where You Come FromBritton Buchanan,"[Verse 1]
I trade goods for glory
I trade love for pain
I trade my tomorrows
If you just say my name
This [?] and this needle
This blood in my veins
I'm an innocent victim
On a runaway train

[Chorus]
But it's time to let go
It's time to break free
From these sins that I hold
And this blood that I bleed
Don't say goodbye
You don't have to hold on
The place where you come from is gone
The place where you come from is gone

[Verse 2]
I found God in the backseat
Of a stranger's used car
I found faith in the rumble
Of the stranger's guitar
I found love at the sea
In a stranger's blue eyes
And I found salvation
In a stranger's goodbye

[Chorus]
But it's time to let go
It's time to break free
From these sins that I hold
And this blood that I bleed
Don't say goodbye
You don't have to hold on
The place where you come from is gone
The place where you come from is gone

The place where you come from is gone
The place where you come from is long gone

I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

[Chorus]
But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

[Verse 2]

What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say, anyway
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe

'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light

At seventeen I started to starve myself
I thought that love was a kind of emptiness
And at least I understood then the hunger I felt
And I didn't have to call it loneliness

Tell me what you need

And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
Oh and you in all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment

[Verse 2]
I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took, the more it took away
And I could never get enough
I thought that love was on the stage, give yourself to strangers
You don't have to be afraid
Then it tries to find a home
With people or when I'm alone
Picking it apart
And staring at your phone

We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger

Tell me what you need
Oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby

UsJames Bay,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm beaten
Sometimes I'm broke
‘Cause sometimes this city is nothing but smoke
Is there a secret?
Is there a code?
Can we make it better?
'Cause I'm losing hope

Tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

After the wreckage
After the dust
I still hear the howling, I still feel the rush
Over the riots, above all the noise
Through all the worry, I still hear your voice

[Chorus]
So, tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how ‘cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we will find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

[Bridge]
We used to be kids living just for kicks
In cinema seats, learning how to kiss
Running through streets that were painted gold
We never believed we'd grow up like this

[Chorus]
So tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we can find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

This is where I'm fuckin' drawing the line
You talk a great game, trying to make a big name
Soon you're gonna run out of time

During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?

And you know that

I've been searching for a trail to follow again

What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

Haunted by the ghost of you

And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet

Nobody teaches you how to reminisce
Nobody teaches you to hurt like this

[Chorus]
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Yeah, we slide into the arms of someone else

[Verse 2]
No more coked up, broke, nocturnal kids
Was that ever even us? Do we know what we missed?
Nobody teaches you how to win big
Nobody said there's no reverse on this

[Chorus]
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Yeah, we slide into the arms of someone else
In disguise, we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight
Then we slide into the arms of someone else

[Bridge]
Nobody wants to, nobody wants to
Nobody wants to, nobody wants to
Nobody wants to wake up alone

[Chorus]
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
In disguise, we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight
But then we slide into the arms of some, someone else

[Spoken Outro: David Harris]
The weight of the world is love
Under the burden of solitude, under the burden of dissatisfaction the weight, the weight we carry is love
And so must rest in the arms of love at last, must rest in the arms of love"

King Of The CloudsPanic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
Heaven knows that I'm born too late
For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

[Chorus]
I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

[Verse 2]
Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I don't feel anything
At all

[Chorus]
I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
Imagination, take me somewhere I don't know
I'm lost but I better find it alone
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

AfricaWeezer,"[Verse 1]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Verse 2]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

Old FashionedPanic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a thrill, from a kiss to a swill
We were swallowin' the nights like we had nine lives
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so
We were borderline kids with a book of disorders
Medicatin' every day to keep the straightness in order
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone

It's the false side of hope where believers concede
And there's only memories when it's over

So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

Once upon before, we were brilliant and bored
Two dashes of the bitters, add some ice and you pour

And there's only memories when it's over

Give Yourself A TryThe 1975,"[Verse 1]
You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 2]
I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like

[Chorus]
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 3]
And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard
And whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?"

I got crows at my window, dogs at my door
I don't think I can take any more

My brother told me, ""life's not a pain""

I must try to be strong

Naked, afraid
Young mother screams and pushes you
The day you came
Oh joy begin
Weak little thing
More precious there’ll be nothing, no
Oh joy begin

Let’s not forget these early days
Remember we begin the same
We lose our way in fear and pain
Oh joy begin

First just one step
One word and then
With laughter sing, oh life begin
First just one step

Let’s not forget these early days
Remembering we began the same
We lose our way in fear and pain
Oh joy begin

Innocent kiss
Black magic bliss
First broken bone
Sudden and swift
Oh innocence
Let’s not forget these early days
Remember we begin the same
We lose our way in fear and pain
Oh joy begin

Crossing A LineMike Shinoda,"[Chorus]
They’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line

[Verse 1]
I don’t know how to warn you
For what I’m gonna say
'Cause you’re holding so tight to
What I’m taking away
I got demons inside me
So I’m faced with a choice
Either try to ignore them
Or I give them a voice

[Pre-Chorus]
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
Holding back things you don’t know
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
You’re not gonna like where this goes

[Chorus]
And they’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I’m crossing a line

[Verse 2]
It’s not about status
We know it never was
'Cause what good is the kingdom
When you’re missing the love?
This is not a goodbye now
I’m not going away
No, I don’t have the answers
But I do have the faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
Holding back things you don’t know
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
You’re not gonna like where this goes, no

[Chorus]
And they’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for

And they’ll tell you I don’t care anymore

Well, you're so pretty and I love you so
You know I'm your biggest fan
I saw your picture and it's the best
The finest in the land

Camera, lights, and action
Yeah, the words you know so well
You're in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of Hell

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

Well, I love you in that movie show
Can I have your autograph?
It's so funny you have such charm
The whole thing made me laugh

Obetrol and cocktails
You're counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
Didn't they, darling?
Well, they've taken all your things

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

Well, listen, darling
It's been real swell
What can I say?
You've got it all
You're a one woman show
But I'm not gonna lie to you
You could use a little work
Well, at your age
Well

What you got, baby?

Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

I know it's self-imposed

GhostBadflower,"[Verse 1]
I tried it once before but I didn't get too far
I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up
I tried it once before and I think I might've messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be

[Verse 2]
I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough
And I should've told my mother, ""Mom, I love you,"" like a good son
But this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be, yeah

[Bridge]
I tried it once again and I think I might black out
I should've left a letter but I had nothing to write about
My blood is all around me, I get dizzy if I stand up
The cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked

[Chorus]
Yeah, take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be
I tried it once again and I think I went too far
(The man that I was meant to be)
I cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart
(The man that I was meant to be)
I couldn't tell my mother that I love her, I'm a bad son
This life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one"

[Chorus 1]
In my head
In my head

[Verse 2]
Only in, yes, only in a dream
Is anything, is anything the way it used to be?
I dreamt we spoke, I dreamt we spoke again
But when I awoke, when I awoke I could not remember

Anything you said
Anything you said
Anything you said
Anything you said"
CrazyFrom Ashes To New,"[Intro: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me

[Verse 1: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
I give, you take, you always push me away
I love, you hate, it's always, always the same
You're always taking, taking, never giving back
To me, it's in the past, but tell me how you live with that
You always love to hate with every single breath
But since the disconnect, you see the life you wish you had
Yeah, you see the life you wish you had

[Chorus: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel
Am I going crazy?

[Verse 2: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
I can't, I won't, won't bend until I break
I do, you don't, it's always, always the same
All I wanted was for you to understand my mind
I'm over standing by your side, it isn't worth the time
All you wanted was to push me somewhere past the line
Push me somewhere out of sight, push me somewhere out of mind

[Chorus: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel
Am I going crazy?

The LineFoo Fighters,"[Intro]
Yes or no, what is truth?
But a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue?
I was wrong, I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night

[Verse 1]
Break my bones, I don't care
All I ever wanted was a body to share
Heart's gone cold, brush ran dry
Satellite searching for a sign of life

Like you, oh, oh, oh
Somewhere, are you there?

The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives

Listen close, I can't hide
I'm a page torn from a broken spine
Sun gets low, I get high

Somewhere, are you there?

TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIMEThe 1975,"[Pre-Chorus]
You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it

[Chorus]
I swear that I (Swear that I)
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

She said that I should have liked it
I told her ""I only use it sometimes""
Except when I need reminding
I'm petrified

Levitatetwenty one pilots,"[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

[Bridge]
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

[Verse]
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, you’re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell

So turn the hourglass over and let's wreck this
It's a brand new world, I got a brand new heart

She's KeroseneThe Interrupters,"[Chorus]
I'm a match, she's kerosene
You know she's gonna burn down everything
She's an arsonist in her pastime
And I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time

It started out like any other morning
The sky was red, he took it as a warning
She kicked the hive now the bees are swarming
Then played the victim 'til the crowd starts forming
She's got a history of making a scene, yeah
She's telling stories she’s gaslighting
Like he's the executioner and she is the queen
But he's the one whose neck is in a guillotine

He said, I'm a match, she's kerosene
You know she's gonna burn down everything
She's an arsonist in her pastime

The smoke clears out and he's been awakened
He said this life could be mine for the taking
She needs a drink so she start shaking
And play the victim 'til his heart starts breaking
No real tears 'cause she don't mean it
This landscape used to be so scenic
And he could make it out if he could dream it
Rising up from the ash, he's a phoenix

I'm a match, she's kerosene
You know she's gonna burn down everything
She's an arsonist in her pastime
And I've been burned for the last time

Alone In A RoomAsking Alexandria,"[Verse 1]
I've been away a little while, sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind's runnin' wild, I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard the crazy things the voices tell me to do
But it's no use
I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me, I've tried, in the end, I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

[Verse 2]
I saw the world a couple of times, tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole and my mind kept playin' tricks on me
Feelin' older every day, took everything I had to not crash and burn
But I'm starting to learn
Sometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here
So I keep pushin' the limits of what makes me me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

[Post-Chorus]
(Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely)

[Bridge]
I can be better than I was
I can be better than I am
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room"
Torn In TwoBreaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Ignite the fire inside of me
Embrace the life of tragedy
A tide of war and broken dreams

[Chorus]
I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Verse 2]
Is this the fate we fall between?
Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart of atrophy
And take away the remedy

[Chorus]
I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Chorus]
I am torn in two (Please hold on)
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through (Please hold on)
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this war for you (Please hold on)
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

Mad HatterAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
From the manor a cutting whisper
Rising vapors through clocks of gold
Gilding fire unchain the demons
With undercurrents far too strong to hold

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

[Verse 2]
Nightfall haunts us all from the shadows
Cynical beauty now lights the halls
Before the flicker there's only blackness
The end is coming and all my friends are dead

[Chorus]
The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

[Chorus]
Gripped by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the sober state
They're feeding all the voices in my head

(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)

The Labyrinth hedges return to soil
Mother's weeping will go unheard
The dove that once flew here 'round the mazes
Had seen the darkness and chose to take its life

The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

[Chorus]
Gripped by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the sober state
They're feeding on the voices in my head
They're feeding on the voices in my head
They're feeding on the voices in my head
They're feeding on the voices in my head"

Nina Cried PowerHozier,"[Verse 1: Hozier]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus: Hozier & Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power

Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)

Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to
Rattle your chains if you love being free

Left her heart in a letter
Said she'd never been better
But now I know
My original sin
She is down once again

Can't remember the last time, you know
It's been so long

Trippin' over landlines
Cuttin' deep with a dull blade
Running out of unrest
Goin' out of your mind

WavesDean Lewis,"[Verse 1]
There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark
And I feel its warmth
In my hands, in my heart
But why can't I hold on?

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

[Chorus]
And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

[Verse 2]
Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

[Chorus]
And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

[Bridge]
I've watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does

And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves

Move!

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that ""if"" and ""when"" are truly different cries
For ""if"" is purely panic and ""when"" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

[Verse 2]
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Bridge]
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else

I'll morph to someone else

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else

I'll morph to someone else

Not done, not done
Not done, Josh Dun

Party Of OneBrandi Carlile,"Waiter send this to the table, the party of one
The only other lonely soul in this place
And so you're finishing up your coffee
But then where're you gonna run?
Where'd you get that look on your face?

You should always let the sun go down on your anger
Let it burn you to sleep
Bring it closer to danger
To surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep

I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
But I am tired
And I am yours

Don't even think about your freedom or taking that flight
Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your ""I"" statements and your weaponized words
Are paper tigers now

Oh your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking
Are making you more and more alone
And girl, you can slam the door behind you, it ain't never gonna close
Because when you're home, you're already home

I am tired
I am tired
I don't wanna go home anymore
I don't wanna throw stones anymore
I don't wanna take part in the war

I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still

I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord, I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore
I am tired
I am not my own
And I am leaving
Oh, I am tired
But I'm coming home

'Cause I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours
I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours"

Call (Call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

[Verse 1]
What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)

[Verse 2]
What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, ""How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king""

If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else

You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else

'Cause they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them""
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated"

Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line

I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it

I could take the high road

I could take the high road

When in between two places
Where we used to bleed

In City, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

Many long years in the ground
To be with one that's never seen
The one that stands and watches over

I wonder when we'll realize
This is what we got left
And it's our demise
With the water rising
And the air so thin
Still the children smiling
Can we see no sin?

This is what we all have seen
Too many years tearing down
Even though we couldn't believe
It's only clearer in a mirror now

[Chorus]
I wonder when we'll realize
This is what we got left
And it's our demise
With the water rising
And the air so thin
Still the children smiling
Can we see no sin?

See no sin
Say no sin

How do I presume when there's so much at stake?
I was so sure of it all

What if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
If this is our last hope
We would see a sign, oh
We would see a sign

Well I've been running from the ashes we left
Forgiveness begs for itself but how can I forget
There's a stain on it all

But what if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
We had it all
If this is our time now
We wanna see a sign, oh
We would see a sign

So give us a sign
I need some guiding light

I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Outro: Sam Harris]
More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin'..."

Turn it up

Somebody save your soul 'cause you've been sinnin' in this city, I know

My flesh is searchin' for your worst and best, don't ever deny

Secrets on Broadway to the freeway, you're a keeper of crimes
Fear no conviction, grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine

But you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap

[Chorus]
Every night when the stars come out
Am I the only living soul around?
Need to believe you could hold me down

That I can make your hands clap

So can I get a handclap?"

The One MomentOK Go,"[Verse 1]
You're right
There's nothing more lovely
There's nothing more profound
Than the certainty
Than the certainty

[Pre-Chorus]
That all of this will end
That all of this will end
So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

[Chorus]
And this will be
The one moment that matters
And this will be
The one thing we remember
And this will be
The reason to have been here
And this will be
The one moment that matters at all

So while the mud
Reclaims our footprints
And while our bones keep looking back
At the overgrowth that's swallowing the path
There for the grace of God go we
There for the grace of God go we
There for the grace of time and chance
And entropy's cruel hands
So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

[Chorus]

So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build 'til we've blistered our hands
So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build us some temples
Build us some castles
Build us some monuments
And burn them all right down

So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

[Chorus]

So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build 'til we've blistered our hands
(This will be the one thing we remember)
So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build us some temples
(And this will be)
Build us some castles
Build us some monuments
(This will be)
Build us some temples
(The one moment that matters)
Build us some castles
(And this will be)
Build us some monuments

Waste A MomentKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
All the way from Waco to WeHo with a rabbit on her chain
Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

[Verse 2]
Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw
He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, facing where the lines are broken
Oh, name your price to all this living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, face it where the lines are broken
Oh, name a price to all that's living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven"

I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling myself
Fuck everyone else

Look what they do to you

Get up off your knees, girl
Stand face to face with your God
And find out what you are

Hello, my name is human

I'm ready for love, and I'm ready for war
But I'm ready for more
I know that nobody's ever been this fucking ready before, hey

So figure it out, or don't figure it out
I figured it out
The bigger the river (the bigger the river)
The bigger the drought (the bigger the drought)

Get up off your knees, boy
Stand face to face with your God

Somebody ElseThe 1975,"[Verse 1]
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...)

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

You said you'd find someone to take my place (Place, place)

Still BreathingGreen Day,"[Verse 1]
I'm like a child looking off in the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
Oh I'm still alive

I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Oh I'm still alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
My way to you

[Verse 2]
I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime
Oh I'm still alive

I'm like a son that was raised without a father
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together
Oh I'm still alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away, away...

[Bridge]
As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live?
I've been running all my life
Just to find a home that's for the restless
And the truth that's in the message
Making my way away, away

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away, away...

CleopatraThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans

And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Verse 2]
While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Bridge]
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

[Verse 3]
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

[Outro]
I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time"

I want you, baby, like you can't understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, love on the weekend

We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend

I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it

I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me

Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow

I can't hold on
To an empty space

I see a different view

Chain BreakerZach Williams,"[Verse 1]
If you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles
If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies
If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside
There's a better life, there's a better life

[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker

[Verse 2]
We've all searched for the light of day in the dead of night
We've all found ourselves worn out from the same old fight
We've all run to things we know just ain't right
When there's a better life, there's a better life

[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker

[Bridge]
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify, testify
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify

If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker

If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior

Someday, the days will come to end
Sometime, I'll have to face the real me
Somehow, I'll have to learn to bend

All these times, I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened

Never understood what was wrong or what was right

I apologize, whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh

One day, I'll face the hell inside me
Someday, I'll accept what I have done

The StageAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
So I arrived, naked and cold
A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel, I appreciate the time, I'm not alone
(Why don't you get my lawyer on the phone?)
There were days these child eyes
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time and I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate and oh I felt control
(It seems these sheep have quite an appetite)

Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?

In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand
So lost in ego, didn't notice when the time had slipped away

Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We're simply sociopaths with no communication, baby
I see your angle but we differ from our points of view

Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers, just not today

Hope my wheels don't abandon me now
Seein' that I'm out here alone
I'm runnin' out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice
Guiding me to her arms
Mother, I'm alright
It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind
Before a blow to the head
By the gavel of time to wake up
Won't you wake up?
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
Was now the only solution for them keeping the score?
Just wake up
Can't you wake up?
(You do know this is just a simulation, don’t you?)

Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way

Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from

I don't think it's irreversible, anymore
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel

Moth Into FlameMetallica,"[Verse 1]
Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence
Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

[Verse 2]
Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral
Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

[Pre-Chorus]
Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

[Verse 3]
Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution
Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Burn!

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won’t do that fistful will

[Verse 4]
Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction
Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

[Pre-Chorus]
So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

[Chorus]
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

'Cause I, I want honey on my table

[Pre-Chorus]
But I never get it right
No, I never get it right

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stinging me
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please

So I'm cutting that branch off the cherry tree
Singing, ""This will be my victory,""
Then I see them coming after me
And they're following me across the sea

And I don't know why this is happening
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

Seal The DealVolbeat,"[Intro]

Sold my soul
And signed my name in blood
Stole it back
Now praying in the dark
Fooled the Devil
Begging for a fight
Count the dollars
Make your bet tonight

All the anger boils within

How Did You LoveShinedown,"[Verse 1]
You can have the sound of a thousand voices calling your name
You can have the light of the world blind you, bathe you in grace
But I don't see so easily what you hold in your hands
'Cause castles crumble, kingdoms fall and turn into sand

[Verse 2]
You can be an angel of mercy or give into hate
You can try to fight it just like every other careless mistake
How do you justify, I'm mystified by the ways of your heart
With a million lies the truth will rise to tear you apart

Wooaahh!

[Chorus]
No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love?

[Verse 3]
Nothing ever feels quite the same when you are what you dreamed
And you will never look at anything the same when you see what I see
How we forget ourselves, lose our way, from the cradle to the grave
You can't replicate, or duplicate, gotta find your own way

Yeeaahh!

[Chorus]
No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?

How did you love?

[Bridge]
This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury
We are the judge and jury

[Chorus]
No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?

How did you love?

[Bridge]
This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury
This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury

How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love? How did you love?

AlaskaMaggie Rogers,"[Verse 1]
I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

Learned to talk and say

Fire EscapeAndrew McMahon In The Wilderness,"[Verse 1]
I met up with an acrobat
In Brooklyn or some place like that
With life and taxis flying past
We tore that dance hall down

[Verse 2]
Pocket change and subway cars
Our big ideas filled empty bars
You might be from the moon or Mars
Either way, I'm never going home

[Pre-Chorus]
So, let's hang an anchor from the sun
There’s a million city lights but

[Chorus]
You're number one
You're the reason I’m still
Up at dawn
Just to see your face
We'll be going strong
With the vampires, baby
We belong, we belong awake

[Post-Chorus]
Swinging from the fire escape

[Verse 3]
I was drinking from the wishing well
Some junkie metal-head hotel
When we boarded the carousel
The roof was caving in

[Verse 4]
On the stage, my Oxblood friend
Was singing songs about the end
The bankers in the lion's den
Were dropping lines like beggars in the snow

[Pre-Chorus]
So, let's hang an anchor from the sun
There’s a million city lights but

[Chorus]
You're number one
You're the reason I’m still
Up at dawn
Just to see your face
We'll be going strong
With the vampires, baby
We belong, we belong awake

Swinging from the fire escape
Swinging from the fire escape
Swinging from the fire escape

[Verse 5]
Walking home, your hand in mine
Tattoos on the river line
The morning birds are taking flight
Either way, I thought that you should know

[Chorus]
You're my number one
You're the reason I’m still
Up at dawn
Just to see your face
We'll be going strong
With the vampires, baby
We belong, we belong awake
You're my number one
You're the reason I’m still
Up at dawn
Just to see your face
We'll be going strong
With the vampires, baby
We belong, we belong awake

I get my kicks and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I'm on the video

I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo

[Chorus 1]
Bang, bang, give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead, I'm well fed
Give me death or give me head

I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live and it's on my radio
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else

Bang, bang, give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead, I'm well fed
Give me death or give me head

I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen
It's my private movie (Holy War)

When you left this town, with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh, Angela, it's a long time coming

And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind

From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming

Home at last

Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?

They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away

Say Something LovingThe xx,"[Intro: Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away

[Chorus 1: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up, I found love

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
You say something loving
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar

[Post-Chorus: Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away

[Verse 3: Romy Madley Croft]
Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

[Verse 4: Oliver Sim]
Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

[Interlude: Romy Madley Croft & Oliver Sim]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Did you hear me say it?
Say it
Did you hear me say?

[Chorus 3: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
I say something loving
I can't hold it inside, the thrill of affection
Is only getting stronger
I say something loving
All my hesitations are fading, fading
I feel it taking over

[Outro: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft & Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away"
I Dare YouThe xx,"[Verse 1: Oliver Sim]
I'm in love with it
Intoxicated
I'm in rapture
From the inside I can feel that you want to
Wake up high on it
Feel it suspending
I'm enamoured
Way up in the sky I can see that you want to

[Pre-Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
I've been a romantic for so long

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft & Oliver Sim]
I get chills
Heart's rate multiplies

A rush of blood is not enough
I need my feelings set on fire
Now I'm deep in it, infatuated
Strong attraction
Side by side, and I know that you want to

[Pre-Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
I've been a romantic for so long
All I've ever heard are love songs

Singing oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you

DangerousThe xx,"[Verse 1: Oliver Sim]
They say we're in danger
But I disagree
If proven wrong, shame on me
But you've had faith in me
So I won't shy away
Should it all fall down
You'll have been my favourite mistake

[Chorus: Romy  Madley Croft + Oliver Sim]
They say
You are dangerous, but I don't care
I'm going to pretend that I'm not scared
If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye
'Cause I couldn't care less
If they call us reckless
Until they are breathless
They must be blind

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
There are voices ringing over
They keep saying, ""Danger, danger""
I can't make them take you under
Makes no difference
No one can take this away
Should it all fall down, I'll treasure each day

[Chorus: Romy Madley Croft + Oliver Sim]
They say
You are dangerous, but I don't care
I'm going to pretend that I'm not scared
If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye
'Cause I couldn't…
'Cause I couldn't care less
If they call us reckless
Until they are breathless
They must be blind

[Bridge: Romy Madley Croft + Oliver Sim]
Let them say there are warning signs
They must be blind
They must be blind
They say

[Outro: Oliver Sim]
If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye"

A Violent NoiseThe xx,"[Verse 1: Oliver Sim]
If I'm beating every hand away
No one stays
I've got so cautious
And now I choke on every move I make
Let one play
To be that careless

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim]
With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud… for me to hear?

[Chorus: Oliver Sim]
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
Try as I might
With every beat comes a violent noise
The melody's sung
And I don't know the voice
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
You've been staying out late
Trying your best to escape
I hope you find what you're looking for
Let a moment take place
Without running away
I hope you silence the noise

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim]
How could eyes this wide
Lose sight of a world outside?
I've looked away, cowardice
With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud… for me to hear?

[Chorus: Oliver Sim]
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
Try as I might
With every beat comes a violent noise
The melody's sung
And I don't know the voice
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise"
ReplicaThe xx,"[Verse 1: Oliver Sim]
Same right, same wrong
Only difference is that I'm the one
Second time around
Feels like the song's already been sung

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim + Romy Madley Croft]
Mirroring situations, accurate imitation
Do I watch and repeat?
And as if I tried to, I turned out just like you
Do we watch and repeat?

[Chorus: Oliver Sim + Romy Madley Croft]
They all say I will become a replica
Your mistakes were only chemical

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
25 and you're just like me
Is it in our nature to be stuck on repeat?
Another encore to an aftershow
Do I chase the night or does the night chase me?

Mirroring situations, accurate imitation
Do I watch and repeat?
And as if I tried to, I turned out just like you
Do we watch and repeat?

PerformanceThe xx,"[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
If I scream at the top of my lungs
Will you hear what I don't say?
If I dance like I'm on a stage
Will you see I seem out of place?
If I put on a disguise
Will you think everything's alright?
If I leave before the end
Will you forget that I was there?

[Pre-Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
When you saw me leaving
Did you think I had a place to go?
Since you stopped believing
I've had to put on my own show

I'll put on a performance
I'll put on a show
It is a performance
I do it all so
You won't see me hurting
When my heart it breaks
I'll put on a performance
I'll put on a brave face

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
Even when I was hiding
You could always find me
Now you've stopped looking for me
But I'm still playing hide and seek
I want you to notice
But you just don't see
The show is wasted on you
So I perform for me

When you saw me leaving
Did you think I had a place to go?
Since you stopped believing
I've had to put on my own show

All The Pretty GirlsKALEO,"[Verse 1]
All the pretty girls like Samuel
Oh he really doesn't share
Though it's more than he can handle
Life is anything but fair, life is anything but fair

[Verse 2]
Just as soon as they turn older
He'll come and sweep them off their feet
It's only making me feel smaller
All the hidden love beneath

[Chorus]
So won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

All alone, alone again
No one lends a helping hand
I have waited, I have waited
Takes a toll, one's foolish pride
How long before I see the light
I have waited, I have waited for you to lay me down

Sail on by, sail on by for now
They play naked in the water
You know it's hard, heaven knows I've tried
But it just keeps getting harder

So won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

Never surrender, out of the embers

Not the memories or the things we own
Not the picture of us on the wall
So take what you want

It's hard to see your tears in the pouring rain

Take what you want

Take what you want and go
Just go now
Just go, go, go

You and me up against the great unknown
You were my life, now you're out of my life

Can you hear me? I'm tryna hear you
Silence strikes like a hurricane
I'm singing for you, you're screaming at me
It's hard to see your tears in the pouring rain

Take what you want

Take it, no reason for me to hold on
Look in my eyes, I'm letting go
Keep it, don't need it, don't need it, don't need it
Take what you want, take what you want and go

Can you hear me? I'm tryna hear you
Silence strikes like a hurricane
I'm singing for you, you're screaming at me

I don't want anything in our broken home
Not the memories or the things we own
All the memories
Take what you want
Take what you want and go

Can you hear me?"

HeavyLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I don’t like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 2: Kiiara]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

Why is everything so heavy?

When it seems like the whole world is against you

Life is unkind
You can let go of the pain if you choose to

Skies fall apart
It ain't too hard
A universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you

There will be nights that go on forever
Like you're long-lost at sea
Never to be found
Just know in your heart

And so is love
God is inside you
All around you
And up above
Growing, showing, you the way

Skies fall apart
It ain't too hard

Glowing, flowing, all around you"
Love Is MysticalCold War Kids,"[Verse 1]
And when my heart won't break
An empty space between my lungs
And when my knees won't shake
I'll drink to find inspiration
'Cause I'm a red blooded man
When I can't see behind the sun (I can't see behind the sun)
A supernatural plan
Is coming to meet me now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes

[Chorus 1]
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

'Cause I'm a rational man
And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
If the words are true
And the words reveal the same
I come alive when I don't even think

Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water

On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes

[Chorus 2]
Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

[Outro]
To believe again
To believe again"
Feed The MachineNickelback,"[Verse 1]
Addressing those beneath from high above
Convincing his belief for what you love
Baiting every hook with filthy lies
Another charlatan to idolize

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is this suppression just in my mind? (Just in my mind?)
No more questions, get back in line! (Just get back in line!)

[Chorus]
You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)

[Verse 2]
The gears forever turn to grind the mice
Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
Power absolutely all for show
The piper blows his flute and off you go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Is this obsession behind your eyes? (Behind your eyes?)
No more questions, get back in line! (Just get back in line!)

[Chorus]
You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)

[Bridge]
Why must the blind always lead the blind?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
Why do I feel like the fault is mine?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
Why must the weakest be sacrificed?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
No more questions, get back in line!
(Just get back in line!)

[Chorus]
Pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away (Wither away)
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (To feed the machine)
To feed the machine"
Middle FingersMISSIO,"[Verse 1]
I am tired of seeing pretty people everywhere
I am not a model, middle fingers in the air
I used to drink whiskey, now I'm stuck with Perrier
I'm an alcoholic, middle fingers in the air

[Chorus]
I'll just keep on throwing middle fingers in the air
I'll just keep on throwing middle fingers in the air

[Verse 2]
I don't like the music other people tend to share
Hate your loser lyrics, middle fingers in the air
I'm a starving artist nowhere close to millionaire
I prefer my Kia, middle fingers in the air

I'll just keep on throwing middle fingers in the air
I'll just keep on throwing middle fingers in the air

Tearing Me UpBob Moses,"[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a little situation
It's been testing my patience, man
She was keeping me up all night
'Cause you only get so far reading faces
We were off to the races
And I thought to myself, ""Hold tight""
You see there was just this one complication
She was already taken
And what was so wrong felt so right
She said, ""No need to be looking over your shoulder
When you could just come over
And we could work this out just fine""

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
Slow me down, playing by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you

[Chorus]
If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
And I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up

[Verse 2]
It all started with a simple conversation
It was all in the making, man
She was talking me up all night
Kept asking if I was only faking
She was there for the taking
Showing me that she was all mine
She told me she lived just around the corner
I wanted to know her
Ya, she was making me lose my mind
I didn't know quite what I was chasing
She had my heart racing
And all it took was just one night

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
Slow me down, playing by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you

[Chorus]
If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
And I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
Slow me down, playing by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you

[Chorus]
If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
And I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up"
Cold Cold ColdCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
Doctor, look into my eyes
I've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life
Doctor, the problem's in my chest
My heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess

[Pre-Chorus]
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind

Darker in the day than the dead of night

Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right

[Verse 2]
Sweet nurse, don't look at me that way
I've seen those eyes before, I can tell you want to play
Counselor, give me some advice
Tell me, how hard will I fall if I live a double life?

[Pre-Chorus]
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast, because there ain't much time

Darker in the day than the dead of night
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right
Something just ain't right

[Bridge]
And as the darkness falls, it fills up both my eyes
My life before me like a flash in the night
With my arms open wide

[Chorus]
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me? Cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right
Something just ain't right"
Lost On YouLP,"[Verse 1]
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers, falling tender
Long before the days of no surrender
Years ago
And well you know?


[Pre-Chorus 1]
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
Cause I don't know how

[Chorus]
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you
Is that lost on you?

[Verse 2]
Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine

[Pre-Chorus]
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around

[Chorus]
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Bridge:
Lost on you
Lost on you

To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Is that lost on you?"
AloneI Prevail,"[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser]
We used to have it all
It was us against the world, but now
I've been sleeping on my own
Spending all these nights alone, knowing you're not coming home

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
'Cause you're running through my dreams
It's like you're on repeat
Feels like eternity
And I can't believe

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone
I let you in, you bled me out
You left me skin and bone, you left me all alone

[Post-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
You left me all alone

[Verse 2: Brian Burkheiser]
I would've gave it all
Truth be told, I can't believe you're gone
Like a dream, I can't recall
Now I gotta face the fact that you're never coming back

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
'Cause you're running through my dreams
It's like you're on repeat
Feels like eternity
And I can't believe

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone
I let you in, you bled me out
You left me skin and bone, you left me all alone
You used to run, run through my veins
And to be honest, I know I'll never be the same
I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone

[Post-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
You left me all alone

[Bridge: Brian Burkheiser]
I see you in my dreams, I can't believe you're gone
When it's too dark to see, I'll leave the light on
I'll leave the light on, I'll leave the light on
When it's too dark to see

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone
I let you in, you bled me out
You left me skin and bone, you left me all alone
You used to run, run through my veins
And to be honest, I know I'll never be the same
I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone"
Moving On And Getting OverJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time

[Verse 2]
Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

[Bridge]
Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

[Verse 3]
Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
And I sure would like to see you one more time

[Outro]
It's taken me so long just to say ""so long""
And baby it's so wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl
A something-I-can-do-girl
To try to get me through, girl
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby
Moving on
Moving on"
HatedBeartooth,"[Intro]
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure?

[Verse 1]
All alone in a wall-less prison
Didn't forget and you’re not forgiven
Live every day with the pain in the back of my mind
Torture doesn't begin to describe it

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't forget
I won't forgive
I won't forget

Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure?
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore

All alone with my own decisions
I try to scream but you never will listen
It took a while but you're finally out of my life
And I swear there's no better feeling

I won't forget
I won't forgive
I won't forget

Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are

In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore"

Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

HelpPapa Roach,"[Intro]
I think I need help
I'm drowning in myself

[Verse 1]
Did someone turn the lights out?
Or is it just another dark cloud in my head?
'Cause I'm cut deep
My heart won't beat
Deep down low, it's killing me
If I wanna scratch out yesterday
I've got so much I need to say
I've got so much I need to say

They're preying on my weakness
Believe it
I'm thinking to myself, no, not again
And I won't keep listening when temptation's creeping in
If I wanna make it another day
I've got so much I need to say
I've got so much I need to say

[Verse 1: Gus Unger-Hamilton]
There was a wayward lad
Stepped out one morning
The ground to be his bed
The sky his awning

[Verse 2: Joe Newman]
Neon, neon, neon
A blue neon lamp in a midnight country field
Cows surround so you lean on, lean on
So much your hugs become hold ons

[Chorus: Joe Newman + Gus Unger-Hamilton]
Oh, these three worn words
Oh, that we whisper
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language

[Verse 3: Joe Newman]
Well, that smell of sex
Good like burning wood
The wayward lad lay claim
To two thirsty girls from Hornsea
Who left a note when morning came:

[Bridge: Ellie Rowsell]
""Girls from the pool say, ""Hi"" (Hi)
The road erodes at five feet per year
Along England's east coastline
Was this your first time?
Love is just a button we pressed
Last night by the camp fire""

Oh, these three worn words
Oh, that we whisper
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language"
HypnotisedColdplay,"[Verse 1]
Been rusting in the rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
Found myself in trouble
Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

Saying float like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

[Verse 2]
It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again, and again

[Chorus]
How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

Yeah I lift to a permanent high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise"

Name For YouThe Shins,"[Verse 1]
My girl, if you're lucky one day
Rolling down the ancient high street you'll find
In the mirror reflects a woman in her prime
Can you make your way out?
In a world dearly won
Well it's yours love
You can move it around
Given all the drops in the ocean
Better take it one sip at a time
Somebody with an antique notion
Comes along to tighten the line
They're just afraid of you speaking your mind

They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name?
They got a name for everything
All of the clothes that you wear
And all of your bits and pieces yeah

You're flipping through the check-stand rags it appears
There ain't no time to waste, you're getting on in years
You can keep your can up
If you just never eat again
It's a means to a terrible end
Even if your plan is successful
Have you really got room in your life?
Yeah and it's a bland kind of torture
You've played the mother and wife
But what do you really dream of at night?

Give me some good news, baby, oh
I need some good news, baby
Give it to me, give it to me

[Outro]
Give it all or give me up
I won't settle for enough
It's the highs and it's the lows we remember, ooh ooh"
BlameBastille,"[Verse 1]
You go sleep with the fishes
There’s no room for you here
There’s no room for you here
Wrap your teeth around the pavement
'Cause your body’s a message
Send my regards to hell

[Chorus 1]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
""This is my body and soul here""
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
""You’ve got the power to control""
Don’t pin it all on me
Don’t pin it all on me!

[Verse 2]
You’ve been granted three wishes
Say goodbye to your mother, your father, your son
I can hear your pulse racing from here
Sitting next to this gun beats your heart in your mouth

[Chorus 1]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
""This is my body and soul here""
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
""You’ve got the power to control""
Don’t pin it all on me
Don’t pin it all on me!

[Bridge]
Blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)

[Chorus 2]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
""This is my body and soul here""
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
""You’ve got the power to control here
This is my body and this is my soul!”
Fall upon your knees, sing:
“This is my body and soul
Don’t pin it all on me
Don’t pin it all on me!

[Outro]
Don’t pin it all on me
Don’t pin it all on me"
Sweet DisasterDREAMERS,"[Verse 1]
Drifting like it's 1974
Dressing like the Rolling Stones
Hey, ho! Let's go, get some more
Like young Ramones

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Some nights feel like every night
This one feels brand new
Only got bad things on my mind
When I'm with you

[Chorus]
And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster
In a river of champagne
Swimming through the morning after
We float away

[Verse 2]
Dreaming like it's 1984
Dancing like the Talking Heads
Last-call 40's at the corner store
To take to bed
Tell me that you need me on the floor
Passed out in your dirty clothes
Ask me what the hell I'm looking for
Like you don't know?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're making it so easy
To throw myself away

[Chorus]
And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster
In a river of champagne
Swimming through the morning after
We float away

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sweet disaster
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sweet disaster
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Some nights feel like every night
This one feels brand new
Only got bad things on my mind
When I'm with you

[Chorus]
And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster
In a river of champagne
Swimming through the morning after
We float away

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sweet disaster
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sweet disaster
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
The PromiseChris Cornell,"[Verse 1]
If I had nothing to my name
But photographs of you
Rescued from the flame
That is all I would ever need
As long as I can read
What's written on your face

The strength that shines behind your eyes
The hope and light that will never die

[Chorus]
And one promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
As we've always done

[Verse 2]
And you said: ""the poison in a kiss is the lie upon the lips""
Truer words were never shared
When I feel like lies are all I hear
I pull my memories near, the one thing they can't take

[Chorus]
And one promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
As we've always done

[Bridge]
The books still open on the table
The bells still ringing in the air
The dreams still clinging to the pillow
The songs still singing in a prayer

[Verse 3]
Now my soul is stretching through the roots
To memories of you
Back through time and space
To carry home
The faces and the names
And photographs of you, rescued from the flames

[Chorus]
One promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
And dare to rise once more
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
And fill the world with life
As we've always done"
Nimble BastardIncubus,"[Verse 1]
Has it come to this?
We're stuck in the weeds
I get it, I'm not perfect
I was never trying to be
But I'm not long for this earth
If we really only ever get one chance to burn
I gotta trip before I can see the finish
How else would I learn?
I wanna know, how is it you do it?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Won't you show, lowly us?
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Verse 2]
I swing and I miss
And then come the creeps
It makes me want to faint
I wanna know, how is it you do it?
How do you spill the paint?
And then fit it into a frame?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us?
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Break]

[Bridge]
Has it come to this?
Has it come to this?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Look out
Won't you show, lowly us?
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Chorus]
You're a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us?
How do you see the stars?"
Hot ThoughtsSpoon,"[Verse One]
Hot thoughts melt in my mind
Could be your accent mixing with mine
You got me uptight, twisting inside
Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, babe

[Chorus]
Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, yeah
Hot thoughts all in, all in my mind, all of the time
(Woo!)

[Verse Two]
Your teeth shining so white
Light up this side street in Shibuya tonight
Hot thoughts melting my cool
Is it your motion signaling cues
Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time
You must be trouble for sure

[Chorus]
Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, yeah
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I tell it to you slow when I want you to know
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Hot thoughts all in, all in my mind all of the time

[Verse Three]
Took time off from my kingdom
Took a break from the war
Took time off from my kingdom
Raise up my creatures
Diamonds from space
Pure facets and features
Last drag drug from your lips
Making you think how good it was to let baby kiss 'em
And those hot thoughts melting your cool
(Hot thoughts all on my mind and all of the time)
Could be that motion signaling cues
You've got

[Chorus]
Hot thoughts all in your mind, all of the time, yeah
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
All that do my rhyme maketh you mine, yeah
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
You know, I think all, I think all your love is enough"
Third Of May / OdaigaharaFleet Foxes,"Third of May

[Verse 1]
Light ended the night, but the song remained
And I was hiding by the stair, half here
Half there, past the lashing rain
And as the sky[e] would petal white, old innocent lies came to mind
As we stood, congregated, at the firing line

[Verse 2]
Night ended the fight, but the song remained
And so I headed to the wall
Turned tail to call to the new domain
As if in the sight of sea, you're suddenly free
But it's all the same...
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

[Refrain 1]
Was I too slow? Did you change overnight?
Second son, on the other line...

[Verse 3]
Now, back in our town as a castaway
I'm reminded of the time it all fell in line, on the third of May
As if it were designed, painted in sand to be washed away
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

[Refrain 2]
Was I too slow? Did I change overnight?
Second son, for the second time...

[Verse 4]
Can I be light and free?
If I lead you through the fury will you call to me?
And is all that I might owe you carved on ivory?

[Refrain 3]
But all will fade. All I say. All I needed
As a flash in the eye, I wouldn't deny, all receded

[Verse 5]
Life unfolds in pools of gold
I am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold
To be held within one's self is deathlike, oh I know

[Refrain 4]
But all will be, for mine and me, as we make it
And the size of the fray, can't take it away, they won't make it

[Outro]
I was a fool
Crime after crime to confess to
But I hold the fleet angel, she'll bless you
Hold fast to the wing. Hold fast to the wing

Ōdaigahara"
Take MeKorn,"[Verse 1]
You bumped into me
I was down, and you took me up past the ceiling
You are the disease
I'm the remedy that numbs all your feelings
You come looking for me
I'm the only one that keeps you sound
Bring it down to your knees
'Cause I'm the only one that makes you, you, you, you

[Chorus]
Take me
Please, take me
It's the only way
Please, take me

[Verse 2]
You came after me
I'm not worth anything if I'm not inside you
Only you can truly see
All the hell you put me through and the vicious feeding
Can't really be free
'Cause every time I run away you hunt me down
I can't ever blame me
'Cause every time I turn around it's you, you, you, it's you

[Chorus]
Take me
Please, take me
It's the only way
Please, take me

[Bridge]
I feel it calling, I feel it holding me
It's taking everything I love away from me
I feel it ripping, I feel it scarring me
That shit has made me blind to all reality
I feel it calling
I feel it calling
It's calling me
Go away, away
Go away, away

[Chorus]
Take me
Please, take me
It's the only way
Please, take me
Take me
Please, take me
It's the only way
Please, take me"
The CureUnspoken,"We're all related
Brothers and strangers
The king and the beggar bleed the same
We've all got a sickness
A terminal condition
We medicate it
But the pain won't go away

See the eyes of a million faces
Lookin' for it in a million places
Only one can save us, Jesus

You are the cure
Everybody's searching for it
Everybody's reaching out
Trying to grab a hold of something real
You are the cure
Only you can satisfy us
Fill up the void inside us
Never been a heart you couldn't heal
You are the cure

You are the doctor
Healer and father
To the orphan without a home
We fell into darkness
We were lost till you found us
You're the remedy we're looking for

You are the cure for the broken
The hope for a hopeless world
The meaning the purpose
The peace that will make us whole
You don't have to search no more"
SilvertongueYoung The Giant,"[Verse 1]
Trying to think of a way to get started
Stutter my flow, train of thought just departed
Taste of Mezcal on my breath
Let me get this off your chest
Open my mouth, all the gems falling out
Make you lose control

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver, silver tongue
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver, got that silver tongue like, ah
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say?
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue

[Verse 2]
Clothes on the floor, but the bed's on the ceiling
Slurring my lines, but I'm nailing the meaning
I'll say what you want me to say
But talk only gets in the way
Rolling our eyes, no more words to describe how we lose control

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver, silver tongue
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver, got that silver tongue like, ah
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say?
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue

[Bridge]
I've got nothing to loose
And all the things you do
Yeah, I've got nothing to loose

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver, silver tongue
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver, got that silver tongue like, ah
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say?
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue"
Too Much To Think311,"[Verse 1]
Back again I'm holed up
In the waiting room again
Focused on the empty
Getting underneath my skin
How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

[Verse 2]
Look at how the time flies
Burning daylight to the ground
Wash away the ashes
Gonna quiet my head down
How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keeping me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

[Verse 3]
Illuminate the shadow
And try to keep the light within (keep the light within)
Avoid another battle
And forget what might have been
How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keeping me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I've had too much to think

[Verse 4]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA
See the faces of the people as they run away
It's a permanent made distraction, the modern reaction
The people don't have to feel the dissatisfaction
It's a slow journey up but a quick ride on down
And nobody here knowing their way around
From the top of the world every which way is down
And who's gonna take the crown?

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're keeping me low (But you're keeping me low)
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I've had too much to think"

There's no stopping now, green lights forever

Hard TimesParamore,"[Verse 1]
All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm all right
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it’s alright
For me to come out

[Chorus]
(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives) And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times)
(Hard times)
And I gotta get to rock bottom (Oof!)

[Verse 2]
Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain’t coming down
Where do I go?
Gimme some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning!
Maybe I’ll come alive

(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives) And I still don't know how I even survive

And I gotta hit rock bottom (Oof!)

Tell my friends I’m coming down

Tell my friends I’m coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
When I hit the ground

When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground

In The BloodJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 2]
How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 3]
How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?"
Good Goode',"[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode"

And the rings I am breakin' are makin' you a personal debt

[Bridge: 2D & Popcaan]
With the holograms beside me, I'll dance alone tonight
In a mirrored world, are you beside me
All my life?
Distortion

[Chorus: 2D & Popcaan]
All my life

And the rings I am breakin' are makin' you a personal debt"
RosieJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Rosie
Come down and get the door for me
I'm drunk again, remember when we used to be?
Rosie
I know you said no more for me
But that was all before this dream that just came to me

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

[Verse 2]
Rosie
You don't have to hide his things
I'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
Whoa-oh-oh, Rosie
Don't you know my love is true
'Perdon' and 'lo siento', see, I learned those words for you

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune"
Still Feel Like Your ManJohn Mayer,"[Intro]
I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man

[Verse 1]
The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can

[Chorus]
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

[Verse 2]
I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there

[Chorus]
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man, oh mama
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man, your man

[Bridge]
(Ever since the day we met, ever since the day we met)
Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, be—

[Chorus]
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
(I still feel like) Still feel like your man (oh honey)
Still feel like your man

I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man (And I don't know why)
Still feel like your man

[Outro]
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still, I still"
Never On The Day You LeaveJohn Mayer,"[Chorus]
No it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave

[Verse 1]
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

[Chorus]
No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave

[Verse 2]
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man

[Chorus]
No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave

[Bridge]
So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave"
AndromedaGorillaz,"[Verse 1: 2-D]
When the pulsing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

[Pre-Chorus: D.R.A.M.]
Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

[Chorus: 2-D]
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Where it all goes down

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
I put it to the right man
He put it back

[Bridge: 2-D]
Caught in your eyes
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

[Chorus: 2-D]
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down

[Outro: 2-D]
Andromeda
Andromeda, Andromeda
Take it in your heart now, lover
Andromeda, Andromeda
Andromeda, Andromeda
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down"
Let Me OutGorillaz,"[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Mama Mavis, oh, Mama, they tried my patience
{Obama} is gone, who is left to save us?
{Orlando,} we mourn, I'm praying for my neighbors
They say the devil's at work and {Trump} is calling favors
You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark, let me out)
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Refrain: 2-D]
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
But until then, I keep my piece in arm's reach

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark) Another night
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change coming
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark) Another night
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change, oh, change is coming
You'd best be ready

[Outro: Mavis Staples]
Be ready, ready for it
Be ready, be ready
(Let me out)"
Don't Take The MoneyBleachers,"[Verse 1: Jack Antonoff]
Somebody broke me once
Love was a currency
A shimmering balance act
I think that I laughed at that
And I saw your face and hands
Coloured in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shave my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
I slept on my own those nights
Was still in my parents' house
And I cut off my t-shirt sleeves
And claim a new continent
'Til I saw your face and hands
Covered in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shake my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money
(I'm in love and you've got me, runaway)
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)

[Bridge: Jack Antonoff]
When you're looking at your shadow
Standing on the edge of yourself
Praying on the darkness
Just don't take the money
Dreaming of an easy
Waking up without weight now
And you're looking at the heartless
Just don't take the money

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff & Lorde]
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Well, don't take the money
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money

[Outro: Jack Antonoff]
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money"

Whiskey soda please, your G&T is empty

To the pool's bottom where we belong

You're Gonna Live Forever In MeJohn Mayer,"[Intro: Whistling]

[Verse 1]
A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Verse 2]
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

[Chorus 2]
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

[Verse 3]
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

[Chorus 3]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

[Interlude: Whistling]

[Verse 4]
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Outro: Whistling]"
HighSir Sly,"[Verse 1]
I’ve been smoking on the peace pipe
I’ve been wondering just what would peace be like
I’ve been staring into headlights
Swallow me whole, finding my peace of mind
I’m just trying to seize the moment
Trying to love the little things, even if they’re hard to love
A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone, “Unwilling to come undone”

[Chorus 1]
It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I’m up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

[Verse 2]
I remember back in Oakland
I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
Moving hotel to hotel
Out on the road, no idea really what’s in store
Light it up just like a flashlight
Let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun
Turn it over and it’s capsized
It’s finally done, the battle's lost, yet I feel I’ve won

[Chorus 1]
It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I’m up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

[Post-Chorus]
It feels good for the first time in a long time now
It feels good to be me

[Chorus 2]
I’m high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I’m along for the ride as I’m taking flight

[Chorus 2]
I’m high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I’m along for the ride as I’m taking flight

[Chorus 1]
It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I’m up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

[Post-Chorus]
It feels good for the first time in a long time to be me
It feels good for the first time in a while I’m free

[Chorus 2]
I’m high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I’m along for the ride as I’m taking flight"

You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya 
They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up

[Refrain: Vince Staples & The Humanz Choir]
The sky's falling, baby

The roof is on fire, she wet like Barbra Streisand
Police everywhere, it's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round Vince on that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit, need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with, them slave bones make Grace Jones
Don't stop, bitch, stay focused, they hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy, them stars falling, don't chase 'em

[Bridge: 2D]
Attack on Iraq, it's on a line
Typing it fast, then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk, I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage 'cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition, well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness and recalling it all
And I’m a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn {Obama} to my partner 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree
(Aghh!)

[Refrain: Vince Staples & The Humanz]
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

Emoji Of A WaveJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Oh honey
You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me
Don't worry
I been thinking bout you too
What do we do

[Pre-Chorus]
Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

[Chorus]
Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

[Verse 2]
Oh honey
I been talking to myself
Just to hear you
And you're saying
Everything I wish you would
And it's so good

It's raining on the mission bell
They're draining out the wishing well
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave

And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on

And sheltered you asleep at night

I know we're gonna be ok

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave

HelplessJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
The same drink that gets me out the door
Is the same drink that puts me on the floor
And the new thing I wanna try some more
Is the same mistake I used to make before

[Chorus]
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

[Verse 2]
The same brain that brings me ecstacy
Is the same pain that gets the best of me
And the one I love the most just said to me
A broken heart is all I'll ever be

[Chorus]
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

Help me
Help me
Help me

If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now

If I'm helpless
If I'm helpless
If I'm helpless

Lights OutRoyal Blood,"[Verse 1]
Every time I'm with it alone
It picks me up
You just send me down
I can feel it rushing under my skin
You're a cage won't you let me in?
On my toes
Lock the door
Pretty face
Through the walls
Don't know if I'd be so sure again

[Chorus]
My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

[Verse 2]
Every time I'm stuck in the ground
Spin me round, won't you spin me round
You're a void, a crack in the mirror
See me now, if you could see me now
You slipped through
The night
Then walked out
Skin tight
But you don't matter that much to me
No you don't matter that much to me

[Chorus]
My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out
So turn the lights out
Just turn the lights out

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out"
ReverendKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
On the lam cut down in the middle of the night caught in a trap
Crushed by the crown of the wandering man who was never coming back
Stuck on the line spending all of his time with his back to the throne
With the flash of the round everybody in town said ""Leave it alone""

[Chorus]
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let it go

[Verse 2]
I got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight facing the ground
Beast of the wild with a porcelain smile as it passes around
The truth in disguise from the billowing eyes isn't working on me
Don't you think you gotta give
Give me something I want
Give me something I need

[Chorus]
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

[Chorus]
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
So my heart will never say so
And my heart will never let you go"
Roll It On HomeJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
One last drink to drink wishful thinkin'
And then another again
The bar is getting brighter
And the walls are closin' in

Journey on the jukebox singin'
Don't let the believin' end
The one that you had eyes for
Had their eyes for your best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

[Chorus]
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

[Verse 2]
The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

[Chorus]
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Drop a couple dollars, bum yourself a light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home

We Got The PowerGorillaz,"[Chorus]
We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that

We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that

And, we dream of home
I dream of life out of here
Their dreams are small
My dreams don't know fear

I got my heart full of hope
I will change everything
No matter what I'm told
How impossible it seems
(We got the power)
We did it before
And we'll do it again

Even when we're tired
And we've been here before
Just you and I
Don't try to rescue me
I don't need to be rescued

But don't forget the machines

Then you'll wake up in the morning
You'll be storming, oh, oh, oh

We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that

ChangingJohn Mayer,"[Chorus]
I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

[Verse]
I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing

Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don’t got one
So we'll build one of our own

Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can’t change my ways

I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing

[Bridge]
Time's been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying “Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart”
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus]
I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
Changing
Changing"
Black Hole SunSoundgarden,"[Verse 1]
In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
The sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

[Chorus]
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

[Verse 2]
Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

[Chorus]
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?

Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?"
Like A StoneAudioslave,"[Verse 1]
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone

[Bridge]
And on I read, until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone"

Want You BackHAIM,"[Verse 1: Danielle]
Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart

[Verse 2: Danielle & Este & Alana]
I said we were opposite lovers
Said it from the beginning
You kept trying to prove me wrong
Said you’d always see it through
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

[Chorus]
But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

[Verse 3: Danielle]
I know it’s hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don’t take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself

[Verse 4: Danielle & Este & Alana]
And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you’d always see me through
All that time is gone, no more fearing control
I’m ready for the both of us now

[Chorus]
So just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back

Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

Fell On Black DaysSoundgarden,"[Verse 1]
Whatsoever I feared has come to light
And whatsoever I've fought off became my life
Just when everyday seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded, now I'm doin' time, now I'm doin' time

[Chorus]
'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

[Verse 2]
Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
And whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
I'm a searchlight soul, they say, but I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking, when I get it right, when I get it right

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

That this could be my fate?
How would I know
That this could be my fate?

And what you wanted to be yours has made it mine
So, don't you lock up somethin' that you wanted to see fly

I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Sure don't mind... sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change

Show Me How To LiveAudioslave,"[Verse 1]
And with the early dawn moving right along
I couldn't buy an eyeful of sleep
And in the aching night under satellites
I was not received
Built with stolen parts, a telephone in my heart
Someone get me a priest
To put my mind to bed this ringing in my head
Is this a cure or is this a disease

[Chorus]
Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live

[Verse 2]
And in the after birth on the quiet earth
Let the stains remind you
You thought you made a man, you better think again
Before my role defines you

[Chorus]
Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live

[Bridge]
And in your waiting hands, I will land
And roll out of my skin
And in your final hours, I will stand
Ready to begin
Ready to begin
Ready to begin
Ready to begin

[Chorus]
Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live

Show me how to live
Show me how to live
Show me how to live

With Or Without YouHunter Plake,"(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Sweeter then a bag of cheva dipped in molasses
The honey blunt got too much resin up on my glasses
You can't see me in the candy store
Got me all off guard forgot why I was here
What I'm shopping for
Candy coated pixie sticks
Hookers by the slurpee machine
Looking to turn tricks
For fix
As I reach up in my belt
And grab out the candy cane
And extract a couple ju-ju bees off into your brain
Watch your frame fall and crumble like peanut brittle
Got you oozing from your walls
Must be caramel in the middle
In the center of your nuget, sits a bullet
And shock tarts spit from trigger
Each time I pull it
I reach for the ginger snaps out the register
Give me all this and a hundred grand mothaf**ker
JD's in the parking lot waiting on me
While R.O.C. is tying up the security

(Chorus)
Bitches, hoes, money and dro
On Halloween I got a sweet tooth for everything
Candy, popcorn and tootsie rolls
On Halloween I got a sweet tooth for everything
Hookers, drugs, pimps and thugs
On Halloween I got a sweet tooth for everything
Serving ugly bitches with a beat down mug
On Halloween I got a sweet tooth for everything

(The R.O.C.)
My hunger pains go deep
Deeper then the core of the Earth
While the planet sleeps
I weep
Brain activity is high on the outcome
Human bodies moving in and out
From the place where they subside
I ride like the wind
Swans
Smoking up their knowledge like
Crumbs
As I fall millions of miles through the core of the Sun
The more light we have come to bring the terror so just run
My chucks are like a utility belt
Detach my tooth
Mamma's know set to blow the roof
My, I spy all the negative energy it radiates profusely
Turn it into misery
Take a piece if you dare
All fifty bags are fixed laced
With the wickedest shit you ever sipped
Now surrender all your smoke to my nigga JD
And blaze with your dead homie
The street creepers

Me and Twiztid made of pure ether
Knocking cop out, they can't reach us
And if you seek us
Catch on up and you'll find
The sweet tooth monstrous internet lines
Are all corroded
Leaving bodies folded
Candy treats frozen
Many flavors posin'
Which will be chosen
They all taste nice
Sweet tooth fiening for your life muthaf**kas

Run your tricks and your treats and your chronic sack

Walking on your porch while I'm spraying my set tag
Dumping out the window of the '65
See the blood splattered postman
It's D's on the ride

I Was WrongJesse Larson,"I flew to Hawaii recently to shoot a film, fresh on the heels of being labeled a homophobic bigot by Andrew Sullivan, Anderson Cooper, and others in the Gay Department of Justice. I wanted to speak with a gay-rights group that I had researched and admired, so I called its local Honolulu branch.

The office number turned out to be some guy’s cell phone. I left him a message—I said, “I’m from out of town, I’m visiting Hawaii on business, I’d like to  get some information on your group.” After two or three more calls, he answered the phone. I said, “Yeah, I’m the guy that called about your organization.” And he said, somewhat impatiently, “Okay, well, what did you want?” I said, “Well, let me put it to you this way, Nick. Your name is Nick? Nick, let me begin by asking you a question. Who would you say, by your estimation, is the most homophobic member of the entertainment industry currently in the media?” And he paused for a long count of four and said, “Um … Alec Baldwin?”

And I said, “Ding, ding, ding, ding! Bingo, Nick, bingo! That’s who you’re talking to.”

He said, “C’mon!”

I said, “Nick, I want to come in and talk.”

I met with Nick and others from two LGBT organizations. We talked for a while about the torment of the LGBT life many of them have lived while growing up in traditional Hawaiian families. Macho fathers. Religious mothers. We talked a lot about words and their power, especially in the lives of young people.

One young man, an F-to-M tranny, said, “Are you here to get dry-cleaned, like Brett Ratner?” Meaning I could do some mea culpa, write them a six-figure check, go to a dinner, sob at the table, give a heartfelt speech, beg for forgiveness. I thought to myself: Beg for forgiveness for something I didn’t do?

I said, “No. I don’t want to get dry-cleaned. I don’t want to be decontaminated by you, Karen Silkwood–wise, scrubbed down. I want to learn about what is hurtful speech in your community. I want to participate in some programs about that. Or underwrite one. And then, like you, I just want to be left alone.”

I’ve read where a number of people have felt that 2013 was a shitty year. For me, it was actually a great year, because my wife and I had a baby. But, yeah, everything else was pretty awful. And I find myself bitter, defensive, and more misanthropic than I care to admit. And I’m trying to understand what happened, how an altercation on the street, in which I was accused—wrongly—of using a gay slur, could have cascaded like this. There’s been a shift in my life. And it’s caused me to step back and say, This is happening for a reason.

I’ve had a relatively charmed life. I loved to be out in the city. New York was my town. I’ve had people come up to me and say, “You’re a great New Yorker. You’ve given your time and money to so many New York charities. You’re a great supporter of the arts. I like some of your movies—and some of your movies suck, actually.” (It’s New York, so people give you their unvarnished opinion.) But people in general had been very kind to me for years.

And then, last November, everything changed.

Am I a homophobe? Look, I work in show business. I am awash in gay people, as colleagues and as friends. I’m doing Rock of Ages one day, making out with Russell Brand. Soon after that, I’m advocating with Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Cynthia Nixon for marriage equality. I’m officiating at a gay friend’s wedding. I’m not a homophobic person at all. But this is how the world now sees me.
I haven’t changed, but public life has.

It used to be you’d go into a restaurant and the owner would say, “Do you mind if I take a picture of you and put it on my wall?” Sweet and simple. Now, everyone has a camera in their pocket. Add to that predatory photographers and predatory videographers who want to taunt you and catch you doing embarrassing things. (Some proof of which I have provided.) You’re out there in a world where if you do make a mistake, it echoes in a digital canyon forever.

And this isn’t the days of Rona Barrett and Ron Galella, who were viewed as outcasts or peripheral at best. Paparazzi today are part of a network that includes the Huffington Post and, much to my dismay, even NBC News, in their reliance on tabloid reporting.

Photographers today get right up in your face, my wife’s, my baby’s. They are baiting you. You can tell they want to get into it with you. Some bump into me or block the entrance to my apartment, frustrating my neighbors (some of whom may regret that I live in their building).

I’m self-aware enough to know that I am to blame for some of this. I definitely should not have reacted the way I did in some of these situations. I don’t have these issues with waiters, traffic cops, store clerks. I know there’s an impression that I’m someone who seeks to have violent confrontations with people. I don’t. Do I regret screaming at some guy who practically clipped my kid in the head with the lens of a camera? Yeah, I probably do, because it’s only caused me problems.

But—I’m sorry, I can’t let go of this—do people really, really believe that, when I shouted at that guy, I called him a “faggot” on-camera? Do you honestly believe I would give someone like TMZ’s Harvey Levin, of all people, another club to beat me with?

What happened is, a TMZ videographer ambushed me as I was putting my family in a car, and I chased him down the block and said, “Cocksucking motherfucker” or whatever (when I have some volatile interaction with these people, I don’t pull out a pen and take notes on what I said). I knew that guy. This was a guy who is on a bike usually, and when we get in a car, he follows us. Very aggressive. The same guy who followed my wife on a bicycle, and when she slipped and fell trying to dodge him and hurt her leg, he laughed at her and said, “See what I made you do?” At my wife. How would that make you feel?

Last year began with making plans to do a play called Orphans, on Broadway. I was filled with hope. I had spent six and a half years on a television sitcom. I won every award you could win in television. I got paid well. And people loved 30 Rock. And I loved 30 Rock. I mean, sometimes you do a show that’s a hit show and you hate it. As my agent used to say, you don’t want to be walking down an alleyway with a flashlight in your hand for ten years, doing some police procedural. We had a ball. And everybody was funny. And I’ll never laugh that way again. And I miss that show terribly. I know we all had to move on because it’s Tina Fey’s show and Tina had worked herself to death. She’s a mom with two kids. Eventually, it had to end. But I’ll never have it that good again, professionally.

Getting back onstage seemed like a good idea. I loved Lyle Kessler’s play and was anxious to work with director Dan Sullivan. Then Shia LaBeouf showed up. I’d heard from other people that he was potentially very difficult to work with, but I always ignore that because people say the same thing about me. When he showed up, he seemed like a lot of young actors today—scattered, as he was coming from making six movies in a row or whatever.

There was friction between us from the beginning. LaBeouf seems to carry with him, to put it mildly, a jailhouse mentality wherever he goes. When he came to rehearsal, he was told it was important to memorize his lines. He took that to heart and learned all his lines in advance, even emailing me videos in which he read aloud his lines from the entire play. To prove he had put in the time. (What else do you do in jail?) I, however, do not learn my lines in advance. So he began to sulk because he felt we were slowing him down. You could tell right away he loves to argue. And one day he attacked me in front of everyone. He said, “You’re slowing me down, and you don’t know your lines. And if you don’t say your lines, I’m just going to keep saying my lines.”

We all sat, frozen. I snorted a bit, and, turning to him in front of the whole cast, I asked, “If I don’t say my words fast enough, you’re going to just say your next line?” I said. “You realize the lines are written in a certain order?” He just glared at me.

So I asked the company to break. And I took the stage manager, with Sullivan, to another room, and I said one of us is going to go. I said, “I’ll tell you what, I’ll go.” I said don’t fire the kid, I’ll quit. They said no, no, no, no, and they fired him. And I think he was shocked. He had that card, that card you get when you make films that make a lot of money that gives you a certain kind of entitlement. I think he was surprised that it didn’t work in the theater.

But firing LaBeouf didn’t help things. Sullivan played both sides. In emails, he coddled Shia. To me, he spoke differently. I was working with an older, more enervated Sullivan, who didn’t have the energy for any of this. I don’t think Sullivan liked the play—I don’t think he liked me. Sullivan agreed to do something that, once he realized what it was, he had lost interest in it. We closed early. I’ll forever be indebted to Ben Foster for stepping in for Shia. He is one of the good guys.

My “career” as a talk-show host started with a perfectly simple ambition. In my WNYC podcast, “Here’s the Thing,” I wanted to conduct interviews based on appreciation of my guests and their work. Or, in the case of those like George Will, a respect for their careers, whether I agreed with them or not. To think that something as uncomplicated and innocent as that led to the MSNBC debacle is still surreal to me. My goal was always to take a talk show to the network. I never wanted to be on MSNBC. My contacts at the network said to me, “We don’t have a slot for you on the network right now.” And I told them that was fine. And they said, “Maybe you go on MSNBC for a year and we’ll hone and refine the show?” And I said okay.

I watched MSNBC, prior to working there, very sporadically. Once I had signed a contract with them, I wanted to see more of what they were about. It turned out to be the same shit all day long. The only difference was who was actually pulling off whatever act they had come up with. Morning Joe was boring. Scarborough is neither eloquent nor funny. And merely cranky doesn’t always work well in the morning. Mika B. is the Margaret Dumont of cable news. I liked Chris Jansing a lot. Very straightforward. I like Lawrence O’Donnell, but he’s too smart to be doing that show. Rachel Maddow is Rachel Maddow, the ultimate wonk/dweeb who got a show, polished it, made it her own. She’s talented. The problem with everybody on MSNBC is none of them are funny, although that doesn’t prevent them from trying to be.

My pitch to them was: I’m going to bring the WNYC podcast to MSNBC. And that show is going to be eclectic—guests who don’t often get the microphone. I want to keep it simple. I get somebody in a chair and I shoot the shit with them for an hour and a half and we cut it into a one-hour show. Dick Cavett was my hero who allowed there to be pauses in the show. He put ­people on who were somewhat unconventional.

So I’m going to go on MSNBC, and people are speculating, “Oh, here he comes! Crazy liberal! And what’s he going to do? Is he going to try to give Bill Maher a run for his money? Is he going to try to give Jon Stewart a run for his money?” And I think, Are you out of your fucking mind? Those men are stars of established, highly successful shows. That’s never going to happen. My show was meant to be as harmless and inoffensive as could be. There was one theme to the 52 episodes of the WNYC podcast and only one way it worked—the show was about appreciation. I wasn’t out to get anybody or make anybody look bad, because I know what that’s like.

MSNBC assigned a producer to me, Jonathan Larsen. Like Sullivan with Orphans, Larsen didn’t get me or the show and didn’t want to be there. When I told him I wanted to interview Debra Winger, Larsen looked like, We’re here on a set, with an expensive crew and studio time, and you want to talk to Debra Winger? There was nothing less interesting to him. Most of the guests I suggested—Ellen Barkin, Neal Barnard from PCRM, JFK-conspiracy icon Mark Lane—he couldn’t care less. As we went along, Larsen would simply stare at me after everything I’d suggest and say, “Well, let’s see what Phil says.” Larsen was sent there to babysit me.

Phil Griffin is the head of MSNBC, and when I saw that Griffin didn’t have a single piece of paper on his desk, meeting after meeting after meeting, that should have been my first indication there was going to be a problem. Phil is a veteran programmer who knows well the corridors and chambers of television programming—and couldn’t give a flying fuck about content. All he wanted to talk about was Giants tickets, Super Bowl tickets, restaurants, movies. The conversations about the set, about the physical production of the show, cameras, lighting—it seemed like he wanted to get those over with as quickly as possible. He didn’t care. He had four monitors on the wall. They were all on, muted. He never listened to them. He never watched them.

The meetings with Phil were brisk and convivial. Eventually, however, we got to the point where he asked, “So you really meant it when you said you wanted to do your podcast on the air, on TV?” And I told him, yes, that was my idea. That was when he explained to me that TV, with its visual component, was different. When viewers turn the channel, they want to see something. They want to see Robert Redford. They want to see Justin Timberlake. TV “captures” the audience with the visual.

He said that we needed to change it up. At first I thought, This is not working. It was a mistake and I need to get out of here. And I told Phil so. Then I stopped and I said to myself, They might be right. I would try it their way.

The first name they came up with was Rob Lowe. They said, Rob Lowe’s going to be in the building. Do you want to interview Rob? I said, “Not particularly.” Rob’s a famous star of films, TV. He’s Rob Lowe. He’s famous. But there’s no shortage of outlets for him. And they looked at me like, You really don’t get it. I think they thought, You should have just said yes, simply to play the game.

I should have simply said, “Sure, bring in Rob Lowe.”

Just prior to all of this, there was Jimmy Gandolfini’s funeral. I was despondent about his death. Jimmy was a “showbiz friend,” one with whom I had worked and greeted warmly whenever our paths crossed. His death hit me somewhat hard, considering his baby daughter and the fact that he was younger than me. I ended up attacking a reporter who wrote in the Daily Mail online that my wife was tweeting from Jimmy’s funeral. He was wrong—in fact, at a later time, she had retweeted items whose original time code matched the time of the funeral.

In my rage, however, I called him a “toxic little queen,” and, thus, Anderson Cooper, the self-appointed Jack Valenti of gay media culture, suggested I should be “vilified,” in his words. I didn’t feel bad about the incident. He lied about my wife. They say this is what comes with stardom—I don’t agree with you. A journalist isn’t supposed to write a lie about you. If he was in New York, I might have had the impulse to beat the shit out of the guy. At the time, I didn’t view “toxic little queen” as a homophobic statement. I didn’t realize how those words could give offense, and I’m sorry for that.

Then this other thing happens with TMZ and then it becomes a one-two punch. All this is based on the fact of them believing what I said on a video.

Harvey Levin exists in his own universe. He’s this kind of cretinous barnacle on the press. Levin told the world that that muffled sound on the video—Levin wanted everyone to know he knows what it is. You don’t know, and I don’t know, but Levin knows, and he tells the world that it’s “faggot.”

I get angry, and I’ve said all sorts of things in anger, but I’d never use that word. Levin has so little regard for the truth, which is odd, knowing he was once a legal correspondent for the CBS affiliate in L.A. He’s also the one who revealed the tape that my ex-wife’s lawyers provided of me yelling at my daughter seven years ago. Knowing that none of it would have transpired if I hadn’t left the message in the first place, I think he hurt my daughter more than anyone.

In the recent video, you see me completely riled up and going after this guy and you hear me saying “cocksucker” and then some bisyllabic word that sounds like “faggot”—but wasn’t. Still, it doesn’t matter. glaad comes after me and Anderson Cooper comes after me and Andrew Sullivan comes after me, all maintaining that I’m a hateful homophobe. All based on what Harvey Levin told them.

Immediately prior to this, I’d go see Phil and I’d say, “What are the ratings?” If I had 15 meetings with Phil Griffin, 5 of them were after the show, with me saying, “What do you make of these ratings?” He’d say, “Don’t worry. It takes time.” (We beat Cooper two of three Fridays at ten.) Although he appeared to have some buyer’s remorse, he told me to hang in there. After the TMZ event, he said, “Don’t worry. I have to suspend you. But this will blow over.” I have all the emails to prove it. And then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, MSNBC said, “You’re fired.”

Once they fired me, a former MSNBC employee I knew emailed me. He said, “You watch now, Phil is going to start leaking left and right to bury you.” When I left, “Page Six” was flooded with lies about me. Another told me, regarding the “toxic little queen” comment, that Rachel Maddow was the prime mover in my firing, as she was aghast that I had been hired and viewed me as equivalent to Mel Gibson. Another source told me, “You know who’s going to get you fired, don’t you? Rachel. Phil will do whatever Rachel tells him to do.” I think Rachel Maddow is quite good at what she does. I also think she’s a phony who doesn’t have the same passion for the truth off-camera that she seems to have on the air.

They invoked a morals clause and refused to pay my contract. Later, when Martin Bashir resigned, I was disappointed. Bashir brought a depth of experience and polish that I imagined might help get MSNBC to a higher place, content-wise, in spite of Griffin and his episodes of Lockup and To Catch a Predator. I suppose the end of the show was inevitable. And the Conan O’Brien treatment came as no surprise. What hurt was that several of the writers and segment producers I worked with were wonderful and talented people. As I meandered through the ill-conceived process, I had grown very fond of them and hopeful about our possibilities once Larsen was replaced.

I went to the opening of the play Machinal, put on by Roundabout, where I’m on the board, and I can’t tell you how frosty the reception was toward me. These are all people who are heavy-hitting theatrical artists in that community and many of them are gay. And I was thinking to myself, These people think I’m a homophobe. And that makes me incredibly sad.
Every time people throw this mud on me, there are very serious consequences in my life. The single most painful episode for me was last year when a New York Post photographer, an ex-cop, accused me of ­calling him a “coon.” This was totally false, as was revealed on his own tape. A D.A. in the hate-crimes unit called me in. At the time, I had just been asked to join the board of the Arthur Ashe Learning Center, so I had to call Jeanne Moutoussamy­-Ashe and ask her, now that I was on the cover of the New York Post labeled as a racist, if she still wanted me to attend a coming event. Jeanne was her ever-gracious self and said yes, but that broke my heart.

I spent 25 years working hard for the issues I care about. When 30 Rock went into syndication, I sensed that I was going to be on TV for a bit, so I crafted my arrangement with Capital One Bank to fund my foundation for charitable giving. They paid me $15 million over nearly five years. After taxes and accounting fees, I will have given all of it, $14.125 million, to charity. After the TMZ event, Capital One did not renew my contract, although it politely said the two things were unrelated. AT&T had booked me for a paid speech in Orlando—and then canceled. WNYC lost funding for my radio show. Bill de Blasio, who apparently gets his news from TMZ, too, distanced himself from me.

Now I loathe and despise the media in a way I did not think possible. I used to engage with the media knowing that some of it would be adversarial, but now it’s superfluous at best and toxic at its worst. If MSNBC went off the air tomorrow, what difference would it make? If the Huffington Post went out of business tomorrow, what difference would it make? Arianna Huffington accomplished what she wanted to accomplish. She created this wonderful thing. And what have they done with that? They want clicks, I get it. They’ve gotta have clicks for their advertisers, so they’re going to need as much Kim Kardashian and wardrobe malfunctions as possible. The other day, they had a thing on the home page about pimples. Tripe. Liberal and conservative media are now precisely equivalent.

I’m aware that it’s ironic that I’m making this case in the media—but this is the last time I’m going to talk about my personal life in an American publication ever again.

When this whole thing happened, Warren Beatty, who is mystifyingly intelligent and wise, said to me: Your problem is a very basic one, and it’s very common to actors. And that’s when we step in front of a camera, we feel the need to make it into a moment. This instinct, even unconsciously, is to make the exchange in front of the camera a dramatic one. Perhaps I fell for that.
In the New Media culture, anything good you do is tossed in a pit, and you are measured by who you are on your worst day. What’s the Boy Scout code? Trustworthy. Loyal. Helpful. Friendly. Courteous. Kind. Obedient. Cheerful. Thrifty. Brave. Clean. Reverent. I might be all of those things, at certain moments. But people suspect that whatever good you do, you are faking. You’re that guy. You’re that guy that says this. There is a core of outlets that are pushing these stories out. Breitbart clutters the blogosphere with “Alec Baldwin, he’s the Devil, he’s Fidel Baldwin.”

Broadway has changed, by my lights. The TV networks, too. New York has changed. Even the U.S., which is so preposterously judgmental now. The heart, the arteries of the country are now clogged with hate. The fuel of American political life is hatred. Who would ever dream that Obama would deserve to be treated the way he has been? The birth-certificate bullshit, which is just Obama’s version of Swiftboating. And all for the electoral nullification that seems like a cancer on the American system. But this is Roger Ailes. And Fox. And Breitbart. And this is all about hate. It’s Hate Incorporated. But the liberals have taken the bait and run in the same direction—and it’s just as corrosive. MSNBC, in its own way, is as full of shit, as redundant and as superfluous, as Fox.

I think America’s more fucked up now than it’s ever been. People are angry that in the game of musical chairs that is the U.S. economy, there are less seats at the table when the music stops. And at every recession, the music is stopping.

Am I bitter about some of the things that have happened to me in the past year? Yes, I’m a human being. I always had big ambitions. I had dreams of running for office at some point in the next five years. In the pyramid of decision-making in New York City politics, rich people come first, unions second, and rank-and-file New Yorkers come dead last. I wanted to change that. I wanted to find a way to lower the cost of the city government and thus reduce New York’s shameful tax burden. I would have decentralized the schools. My father was a public-school teacher. He always told me that although you could encourage a child to work hard, you could only go so far; that half the goal had to be achieved at home. As progressive as I’ve been in my politics, there are other things I don’t think of as liberal or progressive, just common sense. Of course, another thing I would have done—and this will not surprise anyone—is change the paparazzi law.

I’ve lived in New York since 1979. It was a place that they gave you your anonymity. And not just if you were famous. New Yorkers nodded at you. New Yorkers smiled at you at the Shakespeare & Co. bookshop. New Yorkers would make a terse comment to you. “Big fan,” they’d say. “Loved you in Streetcar,” they’d say. They signaled their appreciation of you very politely. To be a New Yorker meant you gave everybody five feet. You gave everybody their privacy. I recall how, in a big city, many people had to play out private moments in public: a woman sobbing at a pay phone (remember pay phones?), someone studying their paperwork, undisturbed, at the Oyster Bar, before catching the train. We allowed people privacy, we left them alone. And now we don’t leave each other alone. Now we live in a digital arena, like some Roman Colosseum, with our thumbs up or thumbs down.

My uncle was a lifelong New Yorker. He said, “New York is the place where if you really are one in a million, there’s seven other people just like you right here in town!” And I used to laugh at that. He’d say, “New York, millionaires and whores shoulder to shoulder on 57th Street. Some of them millionaires and whores!”

There was a time the entire world didn’t have a camera in their pocket—the first thing that cell phones did was to kill the autograph business. Nobody cares about your autograph. There are cameras everywhere, and there are media outlets for them to “file their story.” They take your picture in line for coffee. They’re trying to get a picture of your baby. Everyone’s got a camera. When they’re done, they tweet it. It’s … unnatural.

I did not have a happy family life a few years ago. I was divorced and I was very alienated from my daughter and I was out there cutting every ribbon and running around New York hosting events for different causes to supplant my loss, because I didn’t have a family to go home to. Now I don’t want to be Mr. Show Business anymore. I want the same thing everybody else wants. I want a happy home, and for the first time in my adult life, I have one. I love my wife more than anything in the world and I love my child more than anything else in the world and I don’t want that to change in any way.

I probably have to move out of New York. I just can’t live in New York anymore. Everything I hated about L.A. I’m beginning to crave. L.A. is a place where you live behind a gate, you get in a car, your interaction with the public is minimal. I used to hate that. But New York has changed. Manhattan is like Beverly Hills. And the soul of New York has moved to Brooklyn, where everything new and exciting seems to be. I have to accept that. I want my newest child to have as normal and decent a life as I can provide. New York doesn’t seem the place for that anymore.

It’s good-bye to public life in the way that you try to communicate with an audience playfully like we’re friends, beyond the work you are actually paid for. Letterman. Saturday Night Live. That kind of thing. I want to go make a movie and be very present for that and give it everything I have, and after we’re done, then the rest of the time is mine. I started out as an actor, where you seek to understand yourself using the words of great writers and collaborating with other creative people. Then I slid into show business, where you seek only an audience’s approval, whether you deserve it or not. I think I want to go back to being an actor now.

There’s a way I could have done things differently. I know that. If I offended anyone along the way, I do apologize. But the solution for me now is: I’ve lived this for 30 years, I’m done with it.

And, admittedly, this is how I feel in February of 2014.

Shia LaBeouf went to a film screening recently and he wore a bag over his head and the bag says I AM NOT FAMOUS ­ANYMORE. And there was truly a part of me that felt sorry for him, oddly enough."
I Am The HighwayAudioslave,"[Verse 1]
Pearls and swine
Bereft of me
Long and weary
My road has been
I was lost in the cities
Alone in the hills
No sorrow or pity

Under my heels
And still too close
To you, I feel, yeah

About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of
The optimist in me

But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off

I say ""Well, maybe if you wanna go blind""
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer

Hey, man, we all can't be like you

InvisibleLinkin Park,"[Verse 1]
I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

You didn't get your way
And it's an empty feeling

We're all so fake happy

So I been doin' a good job

ForgivenessParamore,"[Verse 1]
You hurt me bad this time, no coming back
And I cried 'till I couldn't cry, another heart attack
If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up
And I don't pick up when you call
'Cause your voice is a gun
Every word is a bullet hole
Shot a hole in the sun
If I never look up maybe I'll never notice

[Chorus]
And you, you want forgiveness
But I, I just can't do it yet

[Verse 2]
There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line
If I follow it down, will we just be alright?
But it could take me all your life to learn to love
How I thought I could love someone
I haven't even begun
If it's all up to us we might as well give up

[Chorus]
And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
No, it's not forgetting
No, I'll never forget it, no

And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness

The System Only Dreams In Total DarknessThe National,"[Verse 1]
Maybe I listen more than you think
And I can tell that somebody sold you
We said we’d never let anyone in
We said we’d only die of lonely secrets

The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

Now you’re saying that I’m asking for too much attention
Also no other faith is light enough for this place

Right NowHAIM,"[Verse 1]
Gave you my love, you gave me nothing
Said what I gave wasn't enough
You had me feeling I was foolish
For ever thinking this could be the one
I wasn't even in the running
Already had your mind made up
You left me searching for a reason
Why'd you leave? Left me in the dust

And I could see for miles
And I've forgotten every line

Now you're saying that you need me, babe

Feels Like SummerWeezer,"[Verse 1]
Climbing up the tower
Just a boy and his computer
I'm still in my bathrobe
Hiding in the shadows
I'm not used to losing
Bye, bye, sugar blue eyes
You're home with the angels
Thank you for being so kind

[Chorus]
I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go, whoa-oh-oh
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
And she was a lover to me, to me, to me, to me

[Verse 2]
Which way is the graveyard?
I'm an iceberg with a warm heart
I'm spiritual, not religious
I'm a Libra, if it matters
Shattered by an email
Your words will fade away
Castle built in the sand
Will only last one day

I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go, whoa-oh-oh
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
Yeah it feels like summer

26Paramore,"[Verse 1]
Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine, until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

[Verse 2]
You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody

PoolParamore,"[Verse 1]
As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
Could've gotten the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new?
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, would you come through?
Happy second chance or happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

[Chorus]
(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

[Verse 2]
As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

[Chorus]
(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame

You know the situation can't be right
And all you ever do is fight
But there's a reason that the road is long
It take some time to make your courage strong

[Chorus]
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love

[Bridge]
When the wolves come and hunt me down
I will face them off and stand my ground
'Cause there's a fire burnin' in me
They will see my strength in this love I found
Oh

[Chorus]
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love

[Refrain]
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love

[Chorus]
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
'Cause it's a hard love"

There's revival, and it's spreading
Like a wildfire in my heart
Sunday morning, Hallelujah

The ViolenceRise Against,"[Verse 1]
Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or was it all a dream?

The bombs are getting closer everyday
""That can never happen here"" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough or is it all a dream?

[Verse 2]
To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream

So can we break this mold?
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

[Bridge]
Well trodden paths are all we take
We need a storm; let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from the shadows
And into the light

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream..."

[Verse 1: Danko Jones]
Feeling rich, feeling poor, feeling nothing more
Self-destructive on a rollercoaster fireball
Cut her tongue, don't believe a word she says
She's on a hunt, cooking, cooking, cooking misery

[Verse 2: Michael Poulsen]
Left my heart on the shelf for way too long
Sick and tired, picking up from the dirty floor
I saw the line of snakes that came to me

[Chorus: Michael Poulsen]
So innocent were the days
The taste of good memories
A bag full of hope that was only for me and you

[Verse 3: Danko Jones]
No more broken dreams
I feel like a loaded gun
Spitting bullets at your armor of mind control
Cut her tongue, don't believe a word she says
She's on a hunt, cooking, cooking, cooking misery

[Verse 4: Michael Poulsen]
Cannot think, cannot talk, cannot do it right
Can't call the doctor, he's as sick as you and I
I saw the line of snakes that came to me

Please let it grow, where it belongs
There in the dark where the shadows are born

To redeem and blossom

Song #3Stone Sour,"[Verse 1]
If you take a step towards me, you will take my breath away
So I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
No one else has ever loved me, no one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take
Then I saw the worst was over when I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place
Out of all the vast illusions, out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face

[Chorus]
If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too

[Verse 2]
Let me take a step towards you, let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads
There's a darkness down inside me that I know we'll both enjoy
And it's screaming from within to set it free
I have left this bloody nightmare in my wake but out of sight
All I want is deviation by design
Out of all the past confusion, out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours, 'cause you are mine

[Chorus]
And if you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too

[Bridge]
It doesn't really matter what you do or say
I'm never going anywhere anyway
'Cause when I'm dying for you, I've never felt so alive

[Chorus]
If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too

[Outro]
I know you saved me too"
J-BoyPhoenix,"[Verse 1]
Ah!
Something in the middle of the side of the store
Got your attention, you would ask for more
I was excited to be part of your world
To belong, to be lost, to be mostly the two of us
Something I was stealing for no reason at all
They hang me higher than a disco ball
But you talked them into letting me go
It's no Picasso, Michelangelo

Something 'bout the jewels you wear
Shiny, shiny bangles on your wrists
And at the Masquerade ball
You feel trapped in a vault, in an empty aquarium
If suddenly you're out of the woods
Then inside of an alley, you're out of words
Well, I thought it was radium at first

[Chorus]
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than that, we're chained
And there's no else to blame
For us two

[Verse 2]
Some things, they don't matter till they matter to you
They stole that money from a homeless girl
The truth is we're all to blame
There are lies and moral consequences
We started at the end of the line
To end up giving up to a couple, who cares?
When you talked me into letting you go
No more coral on the atoll

Something 'bout how hard you learned
Kamikaze in a hopeless world
Do you remember the last time you laughed
And I laughed and you left and I left?
Send me on the lonely other side of the world
With a couple of guys and no alphabet
Put two and two together
We'll make it last forever

[Chorus]
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than that, we're chained
And there's no else to blame
For us two

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than that, we're chained
And there's no else to blame
For us two"
Now That We're DeadMetallica,"[Verse 1]
When darkness falls, may it be
That we should see the light
When reaper calls, may it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns, may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When we’re seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

[Pre-Chorus]
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

[Chorus 1]
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

[Verse 2]
When all is pain, may it be
It’s all we’ve ever known
When flame consumes, may it be
It warms our dying bones
When loss has won, may it be
It’s you I’m madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be
We walk right through that open door

[Pre-Chorus]
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending

Doing It For The MoneyFoster The People,"[Chorus 1]
Just close your eyes
We’re gonna run this blind
We live our lives
Yeah, we’re not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We’re gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
But we’re not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

[Verse 1]
Is it wrong to write the rules?
We gotta strike a match to light the fuse
Now I’m never looking back
It’s time to leave the future in the past

[Pre Chorus 1]
I said it doesn’t matter where I go I am
Calling all the poets into battle I am
Shouting to the world let them know that we won’t
Be afraid to step into the fight
When we can’t see the light

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
We’re gonna run this blind
We live our lives
Yeah, we’re not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We’re gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can

Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

[Verse 2]
Well, if you’re down then soldier up
You better learn to shoot or learn to duck
There’s no retreat and no escape
If we keep dreaming while we’re wide awake

[Pre Chorus 2]
I said it doesn’t matter where I go I am
Calling all the prophets into battle I am
Never going to change who I am I won’t
Bend under the pressure when my back’s on the ropes
I said it doesn’t matter where I go I am
Staring down the barrel of a gun we are
Shouting to the world let them know that we are
Not afraid to step into the fight
When you can’t see the light

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
We’re gonna run this blind
We live our lives
Yeah, we’re not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We’re gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
But we’re not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

[Bridge]
Well it’s a silicon rush
And I’m addicted
I don’t understand
When it starts I can’t switch
Saying what I won’t do
Well pleasure comes as pain too
But mostly it’s an afterthought
And it’s slowly coming after you

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
We’re gonna run this blind
We live our lives
Yeah, we’re not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We’re gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
But we’re not doing it for the money

I ain't trading my youth for no suit and jacket
I ain't giving my freedom for your money and status
So don't say I'm getting older
Cause I'll say it when I do

And I don't wanna go

Hey, little one
I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only friend
My little one

So I'll pass out, blackout drunk in another bathroom stall

I know that today I lost my only friend
How long must I justify my pain through these songs?

I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only little one

In The EndLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
NumbLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"

Daddy got a shotgun looking for a stork

What I've DoneLinkin Park,"[Verse 1]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done

To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

CrawlingLinkin Park,"[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real"
Somewhere I BelongLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong"
Less ThanNine Inch Nails,"[Verse 1]
Focus?
We didn't even notice
We awake in a place
We can barely recognize
Yeah, hypnosis

[Refrain 1]
And you can justify it all
Your back was up against the wall again

[Verse 2]
Shut up, silence
Add a little violence
And offend and pretend and defend and demand my compliance

[Refrain 2]
And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

[Chorus 1]
So what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Go and look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?

[Verse 3]
Needful
Too many fucking people
You'll have to take care of yourselves
You know I've got my hands full

[Refrain 2]
And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

[Chorus 2]
Oh, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Hey, look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?

[Chorus 2]
So what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than? (Are you less- Are you less than?)
And look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?

One Step CloserLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)

And I'm about to)

Breaking The HabitLinkin Park,"[Verse 1]
Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean

I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean

I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way

I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I’m breaking the habit tonight"
Miracles (Someone Special)Coldplay,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
My father said never give up son
Just look how good Cassius become
Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

[Spoken]
“What if they say I’m no good? What if they say ""Get out of here, kid. You got no future?”

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they’re right
No, I’ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say, ""No, wait, they're wrong""
And get to keep on dancing all life long

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Oh Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

Now you could run and just say they’re right
No I’ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait, they’re wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I’m trying to turn k’s to m’, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Outro: Chris Martin]
In you I see someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong"

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

So for one last time I need y'all to roar

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Outro: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar"

Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around and we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade

My Mind Is For SaleJack Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Well, I heard the blinker's on
I heard we're changing lanes
I heard he likes to race
I heard that six or seven words he likes to use
Are always in bad taste
And I heard that Monday's just a word we say
Every seven times around
And then we pin the tail on Tuesday
Watch those strings go up and down
The elephant in the room begins to dance
The cameras zoom into
His mouth begins to move
Those hateful words he uses

[Chorus]
I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

[Verse 2]
And all the real estate in my mind is for sale
It's all been subdivided
Divided into reasons why
My two opposing thoughts at once are fine
The residue from the price tag
On the tip of my tongue
The words don't come they go
How many likes I gotta get
Before I know the truth
And the truth is
Season three will be a great reason
To forget all about reality's
A slippery slope
Watch the TV scream and shout it

[Chorus]
I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

[Verse 3]
Now I heard the blinker's on
I heard we're changing lanes
I heard we need more space
I heard that six or seven words are in bad taste
It's absurd to believe that we might
Deserve anything
As if its balanced in the end
And the good guys always win

[Chorus]
I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite
With the residue from the price tag
On those two opposing thoughts in my mind
Us against them fearful kind of walls"

Up all night on my mind got me thinking
Wanna stay, can you give me a reason?
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone, but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't be mean, if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?
God, I hope so, but I don't think so

Don't be mean, if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it"
Little Of Your LoveHAIM,"[Intro]
Give me just a little of your love

[Verse 1]
You're just another recovering heart
I wasn't even gonna try
You wouldn't even give the time
Could be so easy, you make it hard
Don't think about love too much
My love is gonna be enough

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're so close now
And I know now

[Chorus]
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

[Verse 2]
Don't it feel like that night was from a dream
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've never felt nothing like that
Looking at you, looking right back
You say nothing is ever as good as it seems
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Stop running your mouth like that
'Cause you know I'm gonna give it right back

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're so close now
(Don't let me down) (Don't let me down)
So don't let me down

[Chorus]
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

[Bridge]
Oh with a little strength baby
Oh, I'll never let you down
With a little love, a little love, a little love, a little love
Give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, give me just a little of your love

[Chorus]
Give me just a little of your love (ha)
Give me just a little of your love (come on)
Give me just a little of your love (baby)
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
Give me just a little of your love (just a little of your love)
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
Give me just a little of your love (just a little of your love)

[Outro]
Give me just a little of your love (ha, ha)
Give me just a little of your love (ha, come on)
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love, give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love, just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love"

And there's a fog from the past that's giving me, giving me
Such a headache

Book TI.I:1-68 The Poet to His Book: Its Nature

Little book, go without me – I don’t begrudge it – to the city.

Ah, alas, that your master’s not allowed to go!

Go, but without ornament, as is fitting for an exile’s:

sad one, wear the clothing of these times.

You’ll not be cloaked, dyed with hyacinthine purple –

that’s no fitting colour to go mourning –

no vermilion title, no cedar-oiled paper,

no white bosses, ‘horns’ to your dark ‘brow’.

Happier books are decorated with these things:

you instead should keep my fate in mind.

No brittle pumice to polish your two edges,

so you’re seen ragged, with straggling hair.

No shame at your blots: he who sees them

will know they were caused by my tears.

Go, book, greet the dear places, with my words:

I’ll walk among them on what ‘feet’ I can.

If, in the crowd, there’s one who’s not forgot me,

if there’s one, perhaps, who asks how I am,

say I’m alive, but deny that I am well:

that I’m even alive is a gift from a god.

Otherwise, be silent – let him who wants more read –

beware of saying by chance what isn’t needed!

The reader, prompted, will soon recall my guilt,

the crowd’s voice make me a common criminal.

Beware of defending me, despite the biting words:

a poor case will prove too much for advocacy.

Find someone who sighs about my exile,

and reads your verses with wet eyes,

and silently wishes, unheard by enemies,

my punishment lightened by a gentler Caesar.

For myself, I wish whomever it is no ill,

who asks the gods to be kind to suffering:

what he wishes, let that be: the Leader’s anger done,

grant me the right to die in my native country.

Though you obey, book, you may still be blamed,

and called inferior to the flower of my genius.

The judge’s duty is to search out time

and circumstance. You’re safe regarding time.

Fine-spun verses come from a tranquil mind:

my days are clouded by sudden miseries.

Verse asks for a writer with leisure and privacy:

I’m tossed by winter gales, the storms, the sea.

Every fear harms verse: I’m lost and always

afraid of a sword slicing at my throat.

Even what I’ve created, will amaze just critics:

they’ll read it, whatever it is, with indulgence.

Set Homer, the Maeonian, in such danger,

his genius would fail among such troubles.

Go then, book, untroubled by fame,

don’t be ashamed to displease the reader.

Fortune’s not so kind to me now

for you to take account of any praise.

Secure, I was touched by desire for fame,

and I burned with ardour to win a name.

Enough now if I don’t hate those studies, verses

that hurt me, so that wit brought me exile.

You go for me, you, who can, gaze at Rome.

If the gods could grant now that I were my book!

And because you’re a foreigner in a mighty city

don’t think you come as a stranger to the crowd.

Though you lack a title, they’ll know the style:

though wishing to deceive, it’s clear you’re mine.

But enter quietly so my verse won’t hurt you,

it’s not as popular as once it was.

If anyone thinks you shouldn’t be read

because you’re mine, and thrusts you away,

say: ‘Look at the title: I’m not love’s master:

that work’s already got what it deserved.’

Book TI.I:70-128 The Poet to His Book: His Works

Perhaps you’re wondering if I’ll send you

to the high Palatine, to climb to Caesar’s house.

That august place and that place’s gods forgive me!

A lightning bolt from that summit fell on my head.

I know there are merciful powers on those heights

but I still fear the gods who bring us harm.

Hawks, the smallest sound of wings brings terror

to the doves your talons wounded.

Nor does the lamb dare stray far from the fold

once torn from the jaws of a hungry wolf.

If Phaethon lived he’d avoid the sky, refuse

to touch the horses he chose, foolishly.

I too confess, I fear what I felt, Jove’s weapon:

I think the hostile lightning seeks me when it thunders.

Every Greek who escaped the Capherean rocks

always turned away from Euboean waters:

and my vessel, shattered by a mighty storm,

dreads to near the place where it was wrecked.

So beware, book, look around with timid mind,

be content to be read by the middle orders.

Seeking too great a height on fragile wings

Icarus gave his name to the salt waters.

It’s hard to say from here, though, whether to use

oars or breeze: take advice from the time and place.

If you can be handed in when he’s at leisure, if

you see all’s calm, if his anger’s lost its bite,

if, while you’re hesitating, scared to go near,

someone will hand you in, with a brief word, go.

On a good day and with better luck than your master

may you land there and ease my distress.

Either no one can help, or in Achilles’s fashion,

only that man can help who wounded me.

Only see you don’t do harm, while you’ve power to help –

since my hope is less than my fear –

beware, while that angry emotion’s quiet don’t rouse it,

don’t you be a second cause for punishment!

Yet when you’re admitted to my inner sanctum,

and reach your own house, the curved bookcase,

you’ll see your brothers there ranged in order,

all, whom the same careful study crafted.

The rest of the crowd will show their titles openly,

carrying their names on their exposed faces:

but you’ll see three hide far off in dark places –

and still, as all know, they teach how to love.

Avoid them, or if you’ve the nerve, call them

parricides, like Oedipus, and Telegonus.

I warn you, if you’ve any care for your father,

don’t love any of those three, though it taught you.

There are also fifteen books on changing forms,

songs saved just now from my funeral rites.

Tell them the face of my own fortunes

can be reckoned among those Metamorphoses.

Now that face is suddenly altered from before,

a cause of weeping now, though, once, of joy.

I’ve more orders for you if you ask me,

but I fear to be any reason for delay:

and, book, if you carried everything I think of,

you’d be a heavy burden to the bearer.

Quick, it’s a long way! I’ll be alive here at the end

of the earth, in a land that’s far away from my land.

Book TI.II:1-74 The Journey: Storm at Sea

Gods of the sea and sky – since what is left but prayer? –

don’t shatter the ribs of our storm-tossed ship,

don’t, I beg you, add to great Caesar’s anger!

Often when one god presses, another brings help.

Mulciber was against Troy, Apollo for her:

Venus was friendly to Trojans, Pallas hostile.

Saturnia hated Aeneas, supported Turnus:

yet he was safe through Venus’s power.

Fierce Neptune often challenged the cunning Ulysses:

Minerva often saved him from her uncle.

And however different I am from them,

who denies a power to me, against the angry god?

A wretch, I’m wasting idle words in vain.

My mouth that speaks is drenched by heavy waves,

and fearful Notus hurls my words away,

and won’t let my prayers reach the gods.

So the same winds drive my sails and prayers

who knows where, so I’m doubly punished.

Ah me! What mountains of water churn!

Now, now you think they’ll touch the highest stars.

What abysses sink beneath the yawning flood!

Now, now you think they’ll touch black Tartarus.

Wherever I look there’s nothing but sea or air,

here swollen waves, there threatening cloud,

between, the roar and humming of the winds.

The ocean waves don’t know what lord to obey.

Now Eurus storms in power from the purple east,

now Zephyrus rushes in from late evening,

Now frozen Boreas raves from dry polar stars,

now Notus wars with his opposing brow.

The helmsman’s unsure of what to shun or where

to steer for: his art is baffled by uncertain evils.

Surely we’re done for, there’s no hope of safety,

while I speak the waves drench my face.

The breakers will crush this life of mine, with lips

praying in vain, I’ll swallow the fatal waters.

But my loyal wife grieves only for my exile:

it’s the only ill of mine she knows, and groans at.

She doesn’t see me hurled through the vast seas,

pursued by the winds, she doesn’t see death nearing.

It’s good that I didn’t allow her to ship with me,

or I, poor wretch, would endure a double death!

Now, though I die, since she is free from danger,

at least the other half of me will survive.

Ah! What a swift flame flashes from the cloud!

What a mighty crash resounds from the ether!

The blow on her planks from the waves is no less

than a siege-gun’s heavy thud against the walls.

Here comes a wave that overtops them all:

after the ninth and before the eleventh.

I don’t fear dying: but this way of dying’s wretched.

Save me from drowning, and death will be a blessing.

A natural death or dying under the blade, at least

your body rests on the solid ground, as you ebb,

and there are requests to others, and hope of a tomb,

not to be food for the fishes in the ocean.

Assume I deserve such a death, I’m not the only

traveller here. Why does my sentence drown the innocent?

Gods above, and you of the green flood, who rule the seas,

both crowds of you, desist from your threats:

an unhappy man, let me carry the life that’s granted

by Caesar’s relenting anger, to the chosen place.

If you wish to punish me with the sentence I merit,

my fault, even to my judge, does not deserve death.

If Caesar had wished to send me to Stygian waters,

he wouldn’t have needed your help in this.

He has a power, not to be grudged, over my life:

he’ll take away what he’s given, when he wishes.

You, I pray, whom surely no offence of mine

has wounded, be content now with my troubles.

Yet, if you’re all willing to save this wretch,

the life that’s ruined can’t now be saved.

Though the seas quieten, and kind winds blow,

though you spare me, I’ll be no less an exile.

Book TI.II:75-110 The Journey: The Destination

I don’t plough the open sea to trade my goods

greedy to acquire wealth without end,

nor to reach Athens, I one sought as a student,

nor the Asian cities, nor places I’ve seen,

nor do I sail to Alexander’s famous city,

to see your pleasures, happy Nile.

I ask for favourable winds – who would credit it? –

to set my sails for the Sarmatian land.

I’m forced to touch the wild left shore of Pontus:

I complain my flight from my native land’s too slow.

I pray for the journey to be shorter,

to see the people of Tomis in their unknown world.

If you love me, hold back these breakers,

and let your powers favour the ship:

or if you hate me deeply, drive me to the land assigned,

part of my punishment is in the place.

Drive my body on swiftly, winds – why linger here? –

Why do my sails desire Italy’s shores?

Caesar does not want this. Why hold one he expels?

Let the land of Pontus see my face.

He orders it, I deserve it: nor do I think it pious

or lawful to defend a guilt he condemns.

Yet if mortal actions never deceive the gods,

you know that crime was absent from my fault.

Ah, if you know it, if my error has misled me,

if my thought was foolish, but not wicked,

if as the humblest may I’ve favoured that House,

if Augustus’s statutory law was enough for me,

if I’ve sung of the happy age with him as Leader,

and offered incense for Caesar and the Caesars –

if such was my intent, spare me, gods!

If not, may a towering wave drown my life!

Am I wrong, or do heavy clouds begin to vanish.

is the wave of the changing sea defeated, humbled?

No accident, but you, called as witness,

whom we cannot deceive, bring me this aid.

Book TI.III:1-46 The Final Night in Rome: Preparation

When the saddest memory comes to mind,

of that night, my last hour in the city,

when I recall that night when I left so much

so dear to me, even now tears fall from my eyes.

The day was already here that Caesar ordered

for my departure beyond Italy’s furthest shores.

There wasn’t time or desire enough to prepare

what was fitting, my heart was numb with long delay.

I’d not thought about slaves or companions,

the clothing or the other needs of an exile.

I was as dazed as a man struck by Jove’s lightning,

who lives, whose life’s unknown to the man himself.

But when grief itself cleared my clouded mind,

and at last my senses began to revive,

I spoke to my sad friends at the end on leaving,

the one or two, of so many once, who remained.

As I wept my loving wife wept more bitterly in my arms,

tears falling endlessly over her guiltless cheeks.

My daughter was far away on the Libyan shore,

and couldn’t be informed of my fate.

Wherever you chanced, grief and mourning sounded,

and inside was the semblance of a noisy funeral.

Women and men, children too, cried at my obsequies,

and every corner of home had its tears.

If one might use a great example for a lesser,

this was the face of Troy when she was taken.

Now the cries of men and dogs grew silent:

the Moon on high steered her midnight horses.

Gazing at her, and, by her light, the Capitol,

close to my house, though that was no use to me,

I prayed: ‘You powers that own these sites nearby,

you temples my eyes will never see again,

gods who possess this great city of Quirinus,

I relinquish, receive my salutation, for all time.

And though I take up the shield too late, wounded,

free this banishment from the burden of hate,

and explain to that man-god what error misled me,

so that he doesn’t think my fault a crime,

so my pain’s author knows what you know, too.

If the god is content I can’t be wretched.’

I spoke to the gods in prayer like this,

my wife more so, sobs choking her half-heard cries.

She threw herself before the Lares, hair unbound,

touching the cold hearth with trembling lips,

poured out words to the Penates, before her,

not destined to help the husband she mourned.

Book TI.III:47-102 The Final Night in Rome: Departure

Now vanishing night denied me more delay,

and the Arcadian Bear had turned about her axle.

What could I do? Sweet love of country held me,

but this was the last night before my decreed exile.

Ah! How often I spoke as someone hastened by:

‘Why hurry? Think where and whence you’re hurrying.’

Ah! How often I said, deceptively, I’d a set time,

an appropriate one for my intended journey.

I touched the threshold three times, was called back

three times, even my feet slow to match my intent.

Often, having said ‘Farewell’, I spoke again at length,

and, as if I was going, I gave the last kisses.

Often I gave the same orders, and deceived myself,

eyes turning back towards my dear ones.

At last I said: ‘Why hurry? I’m off to Scythia,

I’m leaving Rome. Both are good reasons for delay.

Living, my living wife’s denied to me forever,

my house, and the sweet ones in that faithful home,

and the friends that I’ve loved like brothers,

O hearts joined to me by Thesean loyalty!

I’ll hug you while I can: perhaps I’ll never again

be allowed to. This hour given me is so much gained.’

No more delay, I left my words unfinished,

and embraced each one dear to my heart.

While I spoke and we wept, Lucifer had risen,

brightest in the high heavens, baleful star to me.

I was torn, as though I had left my limbs behind,

and half seemed severed from my body.

So Mettus grieved when, punishing his treachery,

the horses were driven in different directions.

Then truly the groans and cries of my people rose,

and grieving hands beat on naked breasts.

Then truly my wife, clinging to me at parting,

mingled these sad words amongst my tears:

‘I can’t be separated. Together, we’ll go together.

I’ll follow you and be an exile’s wife in exile.

There’s a path for me too, the far off land will take me:

my going will add little weight to your fleeing ship.

Caesar’s anger drives you to leave your country,

loyalty orders me. Loyalty will be my Caesar.’

So she tried, as she had tried before,

and, with difficulty, ceased trying for my sake.

I went, like one carried off before his funeral,

bedraggled, hair straggling over unshaven cheeks.

Maddened by grief they say she was overcome

by darkness, and fell half-dead in the midst of the room,

and when she rose, hair fouled with filthy dust,

and lifted her body from the cold ground,

she wept for herself, and the deserted Penates,

and often called her lost husband’s name,

groaning no less than if she’d seen the bodies

of her daughter and me, on the stacked pyre,

and wanted to die, to end those feelings by dying,

yet out of care for me she did not die.

May she live, and, since the fates have willed my absence,

live so as always to help me with her aid.

Book TI.IV:1-28 Troubled Waters

Bootes, the guardian of the Erymanthian Bear, touches

the Ocean and stirs the salt-waters with his stars.

I still plough the Ionian Sea, not by my will,

but forced to bravery through my fear.

Ah me! What winds swell the waves,

and throw up boiling sand from the deep!

The breaker leaps mountain-high on prow

and curving stern, and strikes the painted gods.

The pine planks echo, the rigging’s whipped by the wind,

and the keel itself groans with my troubles.

The sailor, confessing cold fear by his pallor,

defeated, obeys his boat, doesn’t guide it by skill.

As a weak rider lets the useless reins,

fall loosely on his horse’s stubborn neck,

so, I see, our charioteer has given the ship her head,

where the wave’s force drives, not where he wishes.

Unless Aeolus alters the winds he’s sent

I’ll be carried to a place I must not visit.

Now Illyria’s shores are far behind, to larboard,

and forbidden Italy shows herself to me.

I pray the wind ends its effort towards a land

denied me, and obeys, with me, a mighty god.

While I speak, fearful and yet eager to be driven back,

with what power the waves pound at her sides!

Mercy, you gods of the blue-green sea, mercy,

let it be enough that Jove is angry with me.

Rescue my weary spirit from a cruel death,

if one already lost may be un-lost.

Book TI.V:1-44 Loyalty in Friendship

O you who’ll always be named the first among my friends,

you above all who thought it right to make my fate your own

who were the first, carissime, the most dear, I remember

to dare to sustain me with words when the bolt struck,

who gave me the calm advice to go on living

when my wretched heart was filled with desire for death,

truly you know whom I mean, by these tokens of your name,

nor are you unaware, friend, of the service you rendered.

These things will always be fixed in my very marrow,

and I’ll be an eternal debtor for the life that’s mine,

and my spirit will melt away in the empty air,

leaving my ashes on the cooling pyre,

before the memory of your merit leaves my mind.

and loyalty fades away through the long years.

May the gods favour you, grant you good fortune

never to be in need, a fate dissimilar to mine.

Still, if this ship were borne on a favourable breeze,

perhaps your faithfulness would go unacknowledged.

Pirithous would not have felt Theseus’s friendship

as deeply, if he’d not gone down to the infernal waters.

That Phocean Pylades was an instance of true love

was due to the Furies, sad Orestes.

If Euryalus had not fallen among the Rutulian host,

Hyrtacian Nisus would have found no fame.

Just as red gold is assessed in the flames,

faithfulness is tested by hard times.

While Fortune helps us, a smile on her calm face,

all things follow our undiminished powers:

But they flee with the thunder, and no one knows him,

who a moment ago was circled by crowds of friends.

And this, which I once knew from old examples,

I know now to be true from my own troubles.

You, barely two or three of so many friends, are left me:

the rest were Fortune’s crew, not mine.

So, O few, aid my wounded state all the more,

and grant a safe strand for my wreckage.

And don’t be anxious with false fears, trembling,

lest this faithfulness offends the god!

Often Caesar praises loyalty among enemy troops:

he loves it in his own, approves it in opponents.

My case is better, since I was no armed opponent

of his, but earned this exile through naivety.

So keep watch on my affairs, I pray you,

in case the wrath of the god can be lessened.

Book TI.V:45-84 His Odyssey

If anyone wishes to know all my misfortunes,

he asks for more than circumstance allows.

I’ve endured as many evils as stars in the sky,

or as many tiny specks as the dry dust holds:

suffered many greater than you’d credit,

that won’t be believed, though they happened.

One part of it, even, ought to perish with me,

and I wish it could be veiled in concealment.

If I’d an untiring voice, lungs stronger than brass,

and many mouths with many tongues,

I still couldn’t compass all my ills in words,

the content is greater than my powers.

Wise poets, write of my troubles not Ulysses’:

I’ve suffered more than the Neritian.

He wandered a narrow space for many years,

between the palaces of Ithaca and Troy:

after crossing seas whole constellations apart

I’m carried by fate to Getic, and Sarmatian shores.

He had a faithful crew and true companions:

I, in my flight, am deserted by my friends.

Joyful in victory, he sought his native land:

I fled mine, defeated and an exile.

My home’s not Dulichium, Ithaca or Same,

absence from which is no great punishment,

but Rome, that sees the world from her seven hills,

Rome, the place of Empire and the gods.

He had a tough body, enduring toil:

my powers are delicate and slight.

He was always engaged in savage warfare,

I was used to gentler pursuits.

A god crushed me, and no one eased my pain:

Minerva the war-goddess brought him aid.

And as the king of the swollen waves is less than Jove,

Jupiter’s anger oppressed me, Neptune’s him.

And, the most part of his toil is fiction,

there’s no mythology in my troubles.

Finally, he found the household he sought,

reaching the fields he’d aimed at, for so long.

But my native soil’s denied to me forever,

unless the wounded god’s anger lessens.

Book TI.VI:1-36 His Wife: Her Immortality

Lyde was not so dear to Antimachus,

nor Bittis so loved by her Philetas,

as you, my wife, clinging to my heart,

worthy of a happier, not truer husband.

You’re the support on which my ruins rest,

if I’m still anyone, it’s all your gift.

It’s your doing that I’m not despoiled, stripped bare

by those who sought the planks from my shipwreck.

As a wolf raging with the goad of hunger,

eager for blood, catches the fold unguarded,

or as a greedy vulture peers around

to see if it can find an unburied corpse,

so someone, faithless, in my bitter trouble,

would have come into my wealth, if you’d let them.

Your courage, with our friends, drove them off, bravely,

friends I can never thank as they deserve.

So you’re proven, by one who’s as true as he’s wretched,

if such a witness carries any weight.

Neither Andromache, nor Laodamia, companion

of her husband in death, exceeds you in probity.

If you’d been assigned to Homer, the Maonian bard,

Penelope’s fame would be second to yours:

either you owe it to your own self, not being taught loyalty

by some teacher, but through the character granted you at birth,

or, if it’s allowed to compare the small and great,

Livia, first lady, honoured by you all those years,

teaches you to be the model of a good wife,

becoming like her, through long-acquired habit.

Alas, my poetry has no great powers,

my lips are inadequate to sing your worth! –

if I had any inborn vigour long ago,

it’s extinct, quenched by enduring sorrows! –

or you’d be first among the sacred heroines,

seen to be first, for the virtues of your heart.

Yet in so far as my praise has any power,

you will still live, for all time, in my verse.

Book TI.VII:1-40 His Portrait: The Metamorphoses

Whoever has a likeness, an image of my face,

take the ivy, Bacchus’s crown, from my hair.

such tokens of fortune suit happy poets,

a wreath is not becoming to my brow.

Hide it, yet know it, I say this to you, best friend,

who fetch and carry me on your finger,

clasping my semblance in the yellow gold,

seeing all you can of the exile, his dear face.

Perhaps, when you gaze, it will prompt you to say:

‘How far away our friend Ovid is from us!’

Your love is a comfort. Yet my verses are a better

likeness, I ask you to read them such as they are,

verses that speak about altered human forms,

the work cut short by it’s author’s sad flight.

Leaving, mournful, I threw it on the fire, myself,

along with so many other things of mine.

As Althaea, they say, burning the brand, burned

her son, and proved a better sister than a mother,

so I threw the innocent books, that had to die with me,

my vital parts, on the devouring pyre:

because I detested the Muses, my accusers,

or because the poem was rough and still unfinished.

The verses were not totally destroyed: they survive –

several copies of the writings, I think, were made –

Now I pray they live, and with industrious leisure

delight the reader, serve as a reminder of me.

Yet they can’t be read patiently by anyone

whose unaware they lack the final touch.

That work was won from me while on the anvil

and the writing lacks the last rasp of the file.

I ask forgiveness not praise, I’ll be praised in full,

if you don’t despise me, reader.

Have these six lines too, if you think they’re worth

placing at the very front of those books:

‘Whoever touches these volumes, bereft of their author,

at least let them have a place in your city,

a greater favour, since he didn’t publish them,

but they were almost snatched from his funeral.

So whatever weakness this rough work may have,

I’d have amended it, if I’d been allowed.’

Book TI.VIII:1-50 A Friend’s Treachery

From the sea, deep rivers will flow backwards

to their source: the hurrying Sun reverse his wheeling team,

earth will bear stars, and skies be cut by the plough,

water yield flames, and fire yield water:

all things will move against the natural laws,

no part of the universe will hold its course:

now all things will be, that I denied could be,

and there’ll be nothing that you can’t believe.

This I prophesy since I’ve been betrayed by one

whom I thought would bring me help in misery.

Traitor, did you forget me so completely,

or were so afraid to come near my disaster, cruel one,

that you’d no regard, or solace for my downfall,

not even to follow in my funeral train?

Does that sacred and honoured name of friend

lie beneath your feet, a worthless thing?

What effort to visit a comrade, crushed by a mighty blow,

and comfort him, you also, with your words,

and if not to shed a tear at my misfortune

still to offer a few words of feigned distress,

and, at least, say something, as even strangers do,

follow the common speech, public phrases –

see my mournful features, never to be seen again,

while you could, on that final day,

and hear, and return to me, in the same tone,

the never to be repeated, forever, ‘Farewell’?

Others, bound to me by no ties, did this,

and shed tears in token of their feelings.

What, weren’t there powerful reasons for our friendship

in our mutual life and our continuing love?

What, didn’t you share so many of my serious

and trivial moments, and didn’t I share yours?

What, didn’t you not only know me in Rome,

but in so many sorts of foreign places?

Was it all in vain, lost in the ocean winds?

Is it all gone, drowned in Lethe’s waters?

I don’t think of you as born in Quirinus’s tranquil city,

the city my feet must never more re-enter,

but on cliffs, that this sinister Black Sea raises,

or in the wild Scythian or Sarmatian hills,

and your heart circled with veins of flint,

and iron seeded in your rigid breast,

and your nurse a tigress, once, offering

full udders to be drained by your tender throat,

or you’d think my ills less alien to you now,

and wouldn’t stand accused by me of harshness.

But since it is added to my fatal loss,

that those youthful times are discounted, now

endeavour to make me forget this failing, and praise

your efforts with these lips with which I complain.

Book TI.IX:1-66 A Faithful Friend

You who read this work of mine without malice,

may you reach life’s goal without hindrance.

And may my prayers that failed to reach the harsh gods,

on my own behalf, have power for you!

You’ll have many friends while you’re fortunate:

when the weather’s cloudy, you’ll be alone.

See how the doves fly to a whitened dovecote,

but a weathered turret never attracts the birds.

Ants never head for an empty granary:

no friends gather round when your wealth is gone.

As a shadow trails those passing through the sun,

and flies when it’s hidden, weighed down by the cloud,

so the fickle crowd chases the glow of Fortune:

when it’s clothed in night’s veil, the crowd is gone.

I pray this might always prove false for you:

yet it’s truth must be admitted from my case.

While I stood firm, my house was crowded enough,

indeed, well known, though it wasn’t ostentatious.

But when the blow came, they all feared its downfall,

and discreetly turned away, in shared flight.

No surprise, since they fear the savage lightning

whose fires often blast everything nearby.

But Caesar approves of a friend who stays loyal

in hard times, however he hates him as an enemy.

and is never angered – no one shows greater restraint –

when someone loves, in adversity, what they loved.

They say even Thoas approved of Pylades,

hearing the tale about Orestes’s friend.

Patroclus’s constant loyalty to Achilles

was often praised by Hector’s lips.

When faithful Theseus went with his friend to the Shades,

they say Pluto, god of Tartarus, was grieved.

Told of the loyalty of Euryalus and Nisus,

Turnus, we credit your cheeks were wet with tears.

There’s faith even for the miserable, approved even in a foe.

Ah me! How few of you my words can move!

Such is my state, such is my fortune now,

there should be no limit to my tears.

Yet my heart, though grieving at my own disaster,

has been made calmer by your own success.

I knew it would happen, dear friend, far back,

when the wind then drove your sail less swiftly.

If there’s a prize for character, or a faultless life,

no one could be more highly valued:

or if anyone’s climbed high through the liberal arts –

well, every cause is made good by your eloquence.

Straightaway, feeling this, I said to you:

‘My friend, a great stage awaits your talents.’

No sheep’s liver, thunder on the left, or the cry

or the flight of some bird I observed, taught it me:

it was augury, a future prediction, based on reason:

that’s how I divined it, and gained my knowledge.

Now it’s true, I congratulate you with all my heart,

and myself, that your genius is not hidden.

If only mine had been buried in deep darkness!

It would have been best if light had failed my studies.

Just as the serious arts serve you, eloquent one,

so dissimilar arts have injured me.

Yet my life’s known to you. You know their author’s

conduct held those same arts at a distance:

you know those verses were the fun of my youth:

though not worth praising, they were still witty.

So, I think, though my offence can’t be defended

by eloquence, such an excuse for it can be found.

Make that excuse, as far as you can, don’t abandon

a friend’s cause: always go on as well as you’ve begun.

Book TI.X:1-50 Ovid’s Journey to Tomis

Golden-haired Minerva’s protection’s mine, and will be,

I pray, and the ship’s name’s from her painted helm.

Under sail, she runs well before the lightest wind,

if oars are used, the rowers speed her onward.

She’s not content to beat her peers in winged course,

she overhauls boats that set out long before.

She weathers the tides and the leaping billows,

not drenched, or overwhelmed, by wild seas.

I first joined her at Corinthian Cenchrae, and she

was the loyal friend, and guide, of my anxious flight,

made safe by the divine powers of Pallas,

through all event, through waves struck by the wind.

Now, I pray, she may also cleave the gates of wide Pontus,

and reach the waters she seeks, by the Getic shore.

As soon as she brought me into Aeolian Helle’s sea,

and reached the long passage through the narrows,

we changed tack to larboard, and from Hector’s city

came to your port, Imbrian land, from where

we reached the Zerynthian shore with a light breeze,

as our wearied keel touched Samothrace.

It’s only a short leap from there for someone seeking

Tempyra opposite: and as far as she took me.

Now I chose to travel the Bistonian land on foot:

while she sailed back through the Hellespont’s waves

seeking Dardania, named from its founder,

and you, Lampsacus, protected by the rural god, Priapus,

and virgin Helle’s straits, she carried in flight so insecurely,

that separate Sestos from Abydos’ town,

and Cyzicos clinging to Propontis’s shore,

nobly founded by the Haemonian people,

and Byzantium’s shores that guard the jaws of Pontus,

the giant gateway between the twin seas.

I pray she wins by them, and driven on a strong southerly

may she quickly pass the clashing rocks,

the Thynian bay and from there hold her course

past Apollonia and Anchialus’s high walls.

Then Mesembria’s harbour, and Odesos,

and the citadel of Dionysopolis, yours Bacchus,

and the exiles from Alcathous’s walls

who, they say, set their gods down in this place.

From there may she sail in safety to the Milesian city,

Tomis, where the anger of an injured god has sent me.

If that comes to pass, a lamb will fall, deservedly, to Minerva,

my resources won’t stretch to a larger sacrifice.

You too, Tyndaridae, the Gemini, this island honours,

I beg you, guard our separate paths with gentle powers!

One ship’s ready to thread the narrow Symplegades,

mine to plough through the Bistonian waters.

Though we take different routes, let the one

find favourable winds, no less than the other.

Book TI.XI:1-44 Ovid’s Apology for the Work

Every letter you’ve read in this entire volume,

was composed in the troubled days of my journey.

Either the Adriatic saw me scribbling these words

in the midst of the waves, shivering in icy December,

or the verses I wrote to the wild roaring of the sea,

astonished the Aegean Cyclades, I suspect,

when I’d passed the Isthmus and its two gulfs on my way,

and boarded the second ship of my exile’s path.

I marvel myself my skill didn’t fail me

in such a turmoil of seas and feelings,

Whether numbness or madness is the name for such efforts,

all my troubles were eased by these troubles.

Often I was tossed, precariously, by the stormy Kids:

often the sea was menacing under the Pleiades,

or the day was darkened by Bootes, the Bear-herd,

or a southerly drew wintry rain from the Hyades:

Often the sea broke over the ship: still I spun

my verse, such as it is, with shaking hand.

Now the rigging shrieks, taut in a north wind,

and the curving breaker rises like a hillside.

The helmsman himself raises his hands aloft,

begging help, in prayer, forgetting his skills.

Wherever I look, nothing but the shadow of a death

I fear with anxious mind, and pray for in my fear.

If I reach harbour, the harbour itself will scare me:

the land has more terrors than the hostile sea.

I endure the deceptions of waves and men,

and sword and sea double my fears.

The one, by my blood, hopes for plunder, I’m afraid,

the other wants to win notice by my death.

A barbarous coast to port, used to savage rapine,

always full of bloodshed, murder, war,

and though the ocean’s stirred by wintry waves,

my heart is more turbulent than the sea.

So grant them greater forgiveness, honest reader,

if these verses are less than you hoped for, as they are.

They weren’t written in my garden, as once they were,

or while you, my familiar couch, supported me.

I’m tossed on the stormy deep, on a wintry day,

and the paper itself is exposed to the dark waters.

Let the storm defeat the man! Yet, at the same time,

let him halt the music of his songs, as I do mine.

Good TimesAll Time Low,"[Verse 1]
On a fault line, late night
Underneath the stars we came alive
And singing to the sky just felt right
I won't forget the good times
While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times

We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times

When we laughed
When we cried
Those were the days
We owned the nights
Locked away
Lost in time
I found the nerve
To say that

And I'll take you at your word

""There's only one girl in this world for you
And she probably lives in Tahiti""

Go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her

Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weeping in the tropical, moonlit night

Am I hanging around in the rain right here
Trying to pick up a girl?
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world?
Is she lying on some tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun?
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long

[Pre-Chorus]
I should be lying on that sun-swept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year, or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I'd go the whole wide world

Tennessee Mountain TopKid Rock,"Palm trees and beautiful hips
Man it dosen't get any better than this
Sun settin' like fire on the Viper Room
Old Lemmy holed up at the bar
And Johnny Depp pickin' on an old guitar
Man I wish old Keith would've taught em how to keep it in tune

I came here lookin' for love
But all I found was sex and drugs
Strung out, broke down, homesick and thinkin' of you

There ain't nothin' like a Tennessee mountain top
Some straight shootin' neighbors that don't name drop
With a preacher man prayin' for peace but still packin' a gun
Singing karaoke in a double wide
With smoke so thick it'll burn your eyes
Oh oh, my sweet Lord I'll warn ya
Fall in love with an angel
You'll end up in California

High tide I felt so alive
Until I spent six hours on the 405
In a jacked up rocky ridge straight rollin' coal
But then I, I turned up the radio
And hear a bunch of... that's got no soul
All pop and hip-hop but no damn rock n roll

I came here lookin' for love
But ended up on a bathroom rug
On my knees prayin' God please see me through

There ain't nothin' like a Tennessee mountain top
Some straight shootin' neighbors that don't name drop
With a preacher man prayin' for peace but still packin' a gun
Singing karaoke in a double wide
With smoke so thick it'll burn your eyes
Oh oh, my sweet Lord I'll warn ya
Fall in love with an angel
You'll end up in California

There ain't nothin' like a Tennessee mountain top
Some straight shootin' neighbors that don't name drop
With a preacher man prayin' for peace but still packin' a gun
Singing karaoke in a double wide
Some sweet southern sugar right by my side
Oh oh, my sweet Lord I'll warn ya
Fall in love with an angel
Fall in love with an angel, yeah
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, love, love
With an angel"
We Know Where You Fucking LiveMarilyn Manson,"[Verse 1]
Let's make something clear
We're all recording this as it happens
No diamond-bullet storefront-blood-bank
Splinters and stained glass

We don't need to move a single prayer bone
Dodge/burn so loud and sub-low
We don't need to move a single prayer bone
Hi-def is still life

[Pre-Chorus]
""So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?""
""So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?""

[Chorus]
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse

[Verse 2]
The world was stripped
Of its superficial surfaces
We don't intend to just eat the street
The asphalt is the good meat

And we will sleep on the skin of its nightmares
We will sleep on the skin of its nightmares
""It's time to just kill this crowd
And scream as fucking loud""

[Chorus]
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse

I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, I love it
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, I love it

Fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire...

We know where you fucking live

We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse

We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live

American DreamsPapa Roach,"[Verse 1]
It feels like, American Dreams caught on fire
We're tearing down the white picket fences
A soldier bleeds, and a soldier dies
Have you ever thought that war was a sickness?
I’m a son of it, fucked up from it
Casualty of my family cause of it
We dare to dream, or live to die
Reunited by the truth at the right time
Something’s wrong here
Or so it seems
'Cause I’m not sleeping in

[Chorus]
American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it's harder to breathe
When you're buried alive
By American Dreams

[Verse 2]
With every bullet hole, there's a blood stain
Another family that's struggling to keep sane
'Cause their neighborhood ain't a safe place
Got us all wearing black every Sunday
And I'm growing numb to the violence
Sing along to the sounds of the sirens
We're trying to keep ourselves alive
But it's hard to get by when it feels like
Something’s wrong here
Or so it seems
'Cause I'm not sleeping in

[Chorus]
American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it’s harder to breathe
When you're buried alive
By American Dreams

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not sleeping in
American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it's harder to breathe
When you’re buried alive
By American Dreams

Cross My MindA R I Z O N A,"[Chorus]
I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

[Verse 1]
All the days you spend on my mind
All the times that I'd say that we'll be together, we'll be together, oh
All the ways you see through my heart
I know the good intentions, they won't last forever, won't last forever

Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

[Verse 2]
All the hours we've spent on the line
All the times that you'd say that I never listen, I never listen
Through the conversations we've had 'til 4 AM
You say you want something different, want something different

[Chorus]
And I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find

Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

Not a single day goes by where you don't cross my
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind"
Living On The 110Prophets Of Rage,"[Verse 1: B-Real]
Living on the 110
Four sharing one tent
Can't afford no rent
Forgotten by the government
Feels like a life time
Stuck and struck down
Waiting for the right time
Running out of luck now
And it's damn shame
See it from the fast lane
Living in the jungle
Tent city struggle
You drive by see the family camped out
By the underpass
You got your blinders on
You want to hit the gas

[Chorus: B-Real, Chuck D]
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You pretend there's democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You depend on democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality

[Verse 2: B-Real, Chuck D]
I lost my home
So I roam wherever
And my belly's on E
And I gots no cheddar
Life gets no better
And my plate is empty
And my mind is hungry
Ain't got no penny
Sidewalk sleeping
Trying to keep on breathing
The hopeless pray
Trying to keep believing
A ghost you're seeing
Left behind by the system
You can see me southbound on Exposition

[Chorus: B-Real, Chuck D]
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You pretend there's democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You depend on democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality

[Bridge]
You better hope and pray

[Chorus: B-Real, Chuck D]
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You pretend there's democracy, hypocrisy

There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You depend on democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality

[Outro: Chuck D]
Hope and pray
Hope and pray
Hope and pray
You better hope and pray
Hope and pray
Hope and pray
Hope and pray
It might be you some day"
Free FallinTom Petty,"[Verse 1]
She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
It's a long day, livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway, runnin' through the yard

Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell

Mary Jane's Last DanceTom Petty And The Heartbreakers,"[Verse 1]
She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on""

[Chorus]
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

[Refrain]
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

[Chorus]
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

[Verse 3]
There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon

[Refrain]
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

[Chorus]
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again"
Learning To FlyTom Petty And The Heartbreakers,"[Verse 1]
Well, I started out down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, the world got still

[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

[Verse 2]
Well, the good old days may not return
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings (Learning to fly)
Coming down (Learning to fly)
Is the hardest thing (Learning to fly)

[Verse 3]
Well, some say life will beat you down
Break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there

[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down

[Outro]
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
Around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)

You Don't Know How It FeelsTom Petty,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me

[Chorus 1]
But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

[Verse 2]
People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

[Chorus 2]
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

[Verse 3]
My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill

[Chorus 2]
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me"
Los AgelessSt. Vincent,"[Verse 1]
In Los Ageless, the winter never comes
In Los Ageless, the mothers milk their young
But I can keep running
Oh I can keep running
The lost sages hang out by the bar
Burn the pages of unwritten memoirs
But I can keep running
Oh I can keep running

[Chorus]
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too?
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too?

[Verse 2]
The last days of the sunset superstars
Girls in cages playing their guitars
But how can I leave?
I just follow the hood of my car
In Los Ageless, the waves they never break
They build and build until you don't have no escape
But how can I leave?
I just follow my hood to the sea, go to sleep

[Chorus]
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too?
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too?

Oh my Lola, we really did it now
I'm a monster and you're my sacred cow
Oh I can keep running
No I can keep on running

How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too?
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind?

[Outro]
I guess that's just me, honey, I guess that's how I'm built
I try to tell you I love you and it comes out all sick
I guess that's just me, honey, I guess that's how I'm built
I try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament
I guess that's just me, honey, I guess that's how I'm built
I try to tell you I love you but it comes out all sick
I guess that's just me, honey, I guess that's how I'm built
I try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament
I try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament
I try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament"
Love FallsHellYeah,"[Verse 1]
Have you cried yourself to sleep?
Have you felt this incomplete?
Have you ever cut yourself so deep
To see if you still bleed?
Do you ever feel wanted?
Do you ever feel needed?
Do you ever feel happy?
Or are you just like me?

[Chorus]
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
Love falls out of me

[Verse 2]
Have you ever wished for death?
And prayed all night for your last breath?
Have you ever wanted to forget
The failure of your dreams?
Because I've never felt wanted
And I've never felt needed
And I'll never be happy
But I guess that's just me

[Chorus]
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me

[Bridge]
I'll never forget the day I died
The memories frozen and denied
Flower of my heart withered and dried

[Chorus]
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me

[Chorus/Outro]
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
Love falls out of me"

Rise UpImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
I've been shaken, waking in the night light
I've been breaking, hiding from the spotlight
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always looking up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season

I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been living, but I was never breathing

Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

[Verse 2]
I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
My, my, how the seasons go by
I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
You know that's how the story goes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

[Chorus 2]
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

[Pre-Chorus 2]
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

[Chorus 2]
My ex’s and the oh, oh, oh’s they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make ‘em oh, oh, oh
They won’t let go
Ex’s and the oh, oh, oh’s they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make ‘em oh, oh, oh

Stressed Outtwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[Outro]
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah"

She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ""Ooh hoo

Oh, we were bound to get together

IrresistibleFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA

[Chorus]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name

[Chorus]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

[Bridge]
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey, I don't know
What you're doing to me,  mon chéri
But the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war

[Chorus]
And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby"

May nothing but death do us part

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part

Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way

Let It GoJames Bay,"[Verse 1]
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

[Breakdown]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

[Outro]
Come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

UGH!The 1975,"[Verse 1]
Hey, boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
""Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself""
It's just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Verse 2]
This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm giving it up, giving it up again

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

Oh, the kick won't last for long but the song only lasts 3 minutes
I think I've lost my phone so won't you call it up for me?
Oh the kick won't last for long but the song only lasts 3 minutes
And I know it's wrong but give me one

And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time

The Sound Of SilenceDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence"""

EverglowColdplay,"[Verse 1]
Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

[Verse 2]
Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don’t slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should, but I can’t let you go

[Chorus 1]
But when I’m cold, cold
When I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feeling within me, everglow

[Verse 3]
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night, we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I’m gonna miss you, I know

[Chorus 2]
But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

[Bridge]
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

Fire And The FloodVance Joy,"[Verse 1]
I was only walking through your neighborhood
Saw your light on
Honey, in the cold I stood
Anywhere I go, there you are
Anywhere I go, there you are
I've been getting used to waking up with you
I've been getting used to waking up here
Anywhere I go, there you are
Anywhere I go, there you are
There you are, there you are, mm

[Chorus]
You're the fire and the flood
And I always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

[Verse 2]
Since we met, I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles away, but I still feel you
Anywhere I go, there you are (anywhere)
Anywhere I go, there you are
Late at night, when you can't fall asleep
I'll be lying right beside you, counting sheep
Anywhere I go, there you are (anywhere)
Anywhere I go, there you are
There you are, there you are

[Chorus]
You're the fire and the flood
And I always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

[Bridge]
""Now, listen here,"" she said
""Boy, when you know, you'll know""
And I know

[Chorus]
You're the fire and the flood
And I always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine
You're the fire and the flood"

The LightDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
Turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You waited, hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow reckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away

[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light

[Verse 2]
An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid to turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind and
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory

[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light

[Bridge]
Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you

[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
Don't ignore
Listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light"
ThroneBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!

[Verse 2]
The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my… throne

[Bridge]
I'll leave you chokin' on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)
I'll leave you chokin' on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

[Chorus]
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne"

Up on my family
Up on your social disease

Up on democracy
Done with all your hypocrisy

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the chaos
And all of the lies
I hate it

[Chorus]
I'm wasting here
Can anyone wash it all away
I'm waiting here
For anyone to wash it all away

Feeds my brutality
Fuck what you think about me

I hate it

I'm wasting here
Can anyone wash it all away

On everything
Up on everything
Up on everything

I'm wasting here
Can anyone wash it all away

I'm wasting here
With everyone just wash it all away
I'm waiting here
For anyone to wash it all away
Wash it all away

Let me tell ya, I'm vicious, not pass-aggressive

You gotta feel courage, embrace possession

Be a fighter, backbone, desire
Complicated and it stings, but we both know what it means, and it's time to get real and inspired

So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten

The Ghosts Of Beverly DriveDeath Cab For Cutie,"[Verse 1]
If only you had known me before the accident
For with that grand collision, came a grave consequence
Receptors overloaded; they burst and disconnect
Til there was little feeling, please work with what is left

[Verse 2]
Oh, I need not be flattered, that you've never been here before
So there’s no need to mention, that you've no firsts anymore
But if you let me be your skyline, I’ll let you be the wave
That reduces me to rubble, but looked safe from far away

[Chorus]
I don’t know why, I don’t know why I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I expect to find
Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

[Bridge]
You wanna teach but not be taught
And I wanna sell but not be bought
So let us not be lonesome
So let us not be lonesome
Lost in between our needs and wants
Our needs and wants

I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I expect to find
Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

A Head Full Of DreamsColdplay,"[Ambience]

[Verse]
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

[Chorus]
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I’ve just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words

Into life I’ve just been woken

The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

It’s time to get down, dirty up our knees in the battle

Mountain At My GatesFoals,"[Verse 1]
I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
What I give, it takes away
Whether I go or when I stay
I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
I see a fire out by the lake
I'll drive my car without the brakes
I see a mountain in my way
It's looming larger by the day
I see a darkness in my fate
I'll drive my car without the brakes

Oh, gimme some time
Show me the foothold from which I can climb
Yeah, when I feel low
You show me a signpost for where I should go

And my desire wears a dark dress
Ah, each day, I see you less

Yeah, when I feel low
You show me a signpost for where I should go

Fire lake and far flame
Go now but come again

Will I run or stand my ground?

Show me the mountain so far behind
Yeah, it's farther away
Its shadow gets smaller day after day

Been standing in the corner, studying the lights
The dreaming of escape will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up and got me in the rays
So I guess I’d better stay
‘Uh uh no come on’ you say

It's a fools gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start 'What if
I won’t see you again’
Around here you never want to sleep all night

Come on and raise this noise for the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on it’s not over if you mean it, say loud
Come on all for love, out from the underground

Won’t you take me too?

Nearly Forgot My Broken HeartChris Cornell,"[Verse 1]
Every time I stare into the sun
Trying to find a reason to go on
All I ever get is burned and blind
Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain

When you came along, the time was right
Pulled me like an apple, red and ripe
Wasn't very long, you took a bite
And did me wrong, and it serves me right

[Chorus]
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go 'round, again
Again

[Verse 2]
Every little key unlocks the door
Every little secret has a lie
Try to take a picture of the sun
And it won't help you to see the light

Every little word upon your lips
Makes a little cut where blood pours out
Every little drop of blood, a kiss
That I won't miss, not for anything

[Chorus]
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go 'round, again

[Bridge]
Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole in the head

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole...

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go 'round, again
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go 'round, again

Here we go 'round, again
Here we go 'round, again
Here we go 'round, again"
PrideAmerican Authors,"[Verse 1]
My home don't feel the same
Last year flew by; goodbye to the good vibes
What we thought were the best times
Nights out with the people I love
Now I'm lost in the neighborhood
That raised me, praised me, made me who I am
But my father was twice the man
And now that pain's resurfacing

Brooklyn don't feel the same
Maybe I'm the one who's changed or the one to blame
Another drink down the drain
Ten more before I get on that plane
I swear I knew just what to say
It's all there on the tip of my tongue
But I don't feel good enough for anyone

Pushed out of the family tree
Upside down, but it was a good life

Staring down all who generalize well
A chemical change of the spirit
Will be the exchange for our visit

Putting  more makeup on the masks that we wear
Turning our nightlights on in the daytime to scare

If it's a game, well (We want it)

If we enter through the front door
With the keys we stole the night before
Are we afraid  to be the masters
Of the tingles of disaster

Someone said they left together, I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor, not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together, you should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together, oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Chorus 1]
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It's not now or never, wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never, just don't make me wait forever""

Thank God For GirlsWeezer,"[Verse 1]
The girl in the pastry shop with the net in
Her hair is making a cannoli for you
To take on your hiking trip in the woods with
Your bros that you’ve known since second grade
And you may encounter dragons or ruffians and be
Called upon to employ your testosterone
In a battle for supremacy and access
To females glued to the TV
And even if you are victorious
You may receive many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
And when you come home she will
Be there waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove in your mouth
And that's why you

[Chorus]
Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe

Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day

She’s so strong
She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls
Thank God for girls

[Verse 2]
I'm so glad I got a girl to think of even though she isn't mine
I think about her all the day and all the night
It's enough to know that she's alive
She says I give her sweaty palms
She almost had a heart attack
The truth is that I’m just as scared I don’t know how to act
I wish that I could get to know her better
But meeting up in real life would cause the illusion to shatter
I carved her name into all the trees
Sang a song down on one knee
Looking at the underwear page of the Sears catalog
Like when I was 14
I’m levitating like a magnet turned the wrong way around
I’m like an Indian Fakir tryna’ meditate on a bed of nails with my pants pulled down

[Chorus]
Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe
From Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day
You better bow down and pray

She’s so strong
She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls

Thank God for girls (Thank God for girls)

[Coda]
God took a rib from Adam, ground it up in a centrifuge machine
Mixed it with cardamom and cloves, microwaved it on the popcorn setting
While Adam was like “that really hurts”
Going off into the tundra, so pissed at God
And he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
Messing with the bees who were trying to pollinate the echinacea
Until God said, “I'm a smite you with loneliness
And break your heart in two”
And Adam wept and wailed, tearing out his hair
Falling on his knees, looked to the sky and said
“Thank God”"

And you could call this the funeral

And you can play this at my funeral

Might go to hell and there ain't no stopping
Might be a sinner and I might be a saint
I'd like to be proud but somehow I'm ashamed
Sweet little baby in a world full of pain
I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it
Everybody's talkin' but what's anybody saying?
Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah

Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars
Throw me in a box with the oxygen off
You gave me the key and you locked every lock
When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop
When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop

Now I'm aware and driving my thoughts, wow

Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it for others to use it
You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here but you comment below
When the comments below has become common
Motivation to promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment
But you and I know it gets better when mornin' finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the mornin' is when night is dead

See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it’s mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

[Guitar Solo 1: Jonny Buckland]

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Guitar Solo 2: Noel Gallagher]

[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, whoa, oh

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough
Don’t ever give up
Don't ever give up

Hotel CaliforniaEagles,"[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!""

Walking On A DreamEmpire Of The Sun,"[Verse 1]
Walking on a dream
How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?

[Pre-Chorus]
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

[Chorus]
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

[Verse 2]
Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

Catch me, I'm falling down
Catch me, I'm falling down

So come on, deliver from inside
All we got is tonight, that is right till first light

Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it

[Verse 1]
Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky
With the best of the best, pull my heart out my chest
So that you can see it too

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck
How do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

[Verse 2]
I'm cutting my mind off
Feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just wanna be served
And when you think of me
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck
How do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo
How could I ask for more?

At the expense of the death of a bachelor

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows

Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

[Verse 1]
Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough
(Don't think I'll ever get enough)

[Audio sample from B52's ""Rock Lobster""]

[Chorus]
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart

Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now
(Don't think I'll ever get it now)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt

And we all fell down
When the sun came up
I think we've had enough

One says she's a friend of mine

Mmm

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it

Oh, whoa whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, whoa, whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty

[Verse 1]
Truth is that it was always going to end
The symphony buzzing in my head
Took a market of filth and sold like summer
True, all of the good girls act so good
'Til one of them doesn't wait their turn
Turn the memory to stone and carve your shoulder
Hey, holy roller

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty

[Verse 2]
I know what it's like to have to trade
The ones that you love for the ones you hate
Don't think I've ever used a day of my education
There's only two ways that these things can go
Good or bad and how was I to know
That all your friends won't hold any grudges
I got the final judgement

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty

[Bridge]
And you been gone so long
I forgot what you feel like
But I'm not gonna think about that right now
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
And all our friends want us to fall in love

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

BlackstarDavid Bowie,"[Intro]
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
​
[Bridge I]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

[​Bridge II]
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar)
​
I can't answer why (I'm a blackstar)
Just go with me (I'm not a filmstar)
I'ma take you home (I'm a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (I'm not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo (I'm a blackstar)
You're a flash in the pan (I'm not a marvel star)
I'm the Great I Am (I'm a blackstar)
​
I'm a blackstar, way up, on money, I've got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a star's star, I'm a blackstar)
I can't answer why (I'm not a gangstar)
But I can tell you how (I'm not a flam star)
We were born upside-down (I'm a star's star)
Born the wrong way 'round (I’m not a white star)
I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar
I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar
I'm not a pornstar, I'm not a wandering star
I'm a blackstar, I’m a blackstar

In the villa of Ormen stands a solitary candle

Golden DaysPanic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
I found a pile of Polaroids in the crates of a record shop
They were sexy, sexy looking back
From a night that time forgot (ooh-oh)
Boy, he was something, debonair in 1979
And she had Farrah Fawcett hair
Carafes of blood red wine

[Pre-Chorus]
In the summertime, in the summertime

[Chorus]
Oh, don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change
We'll stay drunk, we'll stay tan, let the love remain
And I swear that I'll always paint you

[Post-Chorus]
Golden days, golden days, golden days, golden days

[Verse 2]
I bet they met some diplomats on Bianca Jagger's new yacht
With their caviar and dead cigars
The air was sauna hot
I bet they never even thought about the glitter dancing on the skin
The decades might've washed it out
As the flashes popped like pins

[Pre-Chorus]
In the summertime, in the summertime

[Chorus]
Oh, don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change
We'll stay drunk, we'll stay tan, let the love remain
And I swear that I'll always paint you

[Post-Chorus]
Golden days, golden days, golden days, golden days

Time can never break your heart, but it'll take the pain away
Right now our future's certain, I won't let it fade away

Impossible YearPanic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
There's no sunshine, this impossible year
Only black days and sky grey and clouds full of fear
And storms full of sorrow that won't disappear
Just typhoons and monsoons, this impossible year

[Verse 2]
There's no good times, this impossible year
Just a beachfront of bad blood and a coast that's unclear
All the guests at the party, they're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude, this impossible year

[Verse 3]
There's no you and me, this impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak and gin made of tears
The bitter pill I swallow,  the scar's souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise, this impossible year

[Bridge]
There's never air to breathe, there's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on past the dream...

[Outro]
There's no sunshine...
There's no you and me...
There's no good times...
This impossible year..."
Genghis KhanMiike Snow,"[Verse 1]
I know there's no form
And no labels to put on
To this thing we keep
And dip into when we need
And I don't have the right
To ask where you go at night
But the waves hit my head
To think someone's in your bed

[Chorus]
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
I don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me

[Verse 2]
And the lights, they glow
Like I've just lost the World War
And the scene slips away
To the evenness I fake
It's a shit old world
Cause I don't really want you, girl
But you can't be free
Cause I'm selfish, I'm obscene

I get a little bit Genghis Khan
I don't want you to get it on

In The Dark3 Doors Down,"[Verse 1]
Whenever the lights go down
That's when she comes alive
Ooh ooh
Maybe it's just something that you can only see in the light
Ooh ooh
A pretty little vixen dancing out on the scene
But the lights are shining, so she's keeping it clean
Don't get too close
Boy, don't touch her skin
Or you'll never feel the same way again

[Chorus 1]
If everything you see is what you're believing
Then she'll be holding your heart
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She likes to do it in the dark
She likes to do it in the dark, oh

[Verse 2]
Whenever the darkness comes, she'll have you right where she wants
Ooh ooh
Just when you think it's all over
It's where it all starts
It sounds like an angel is calling my name
It might be the devil, but they all sound the same
And all her moves won't let you get away
She's gonna make your mind come with you to stay

[Chorus 1]
If everything you see is what you're believing
Then she'll be holding your heart
And by the time the sun goes down

You won't know who you are

Start A RiotBANNERS,"[Verse 1]
I will march down an empty street like a ship into the storm
No surrender, no retreat
I will tear down every wall
Just to keep you warm
Just to bring you home
I will burn this city down for a diamond in the dust
I will keep you safe and sound when there's no one left to trust
Will you take my hand?
We can make our stand

[Chorus]
If your world falls apart
I'd start a riot
If night falls in your heart
I'd light the fire
In the dark, when you sound the alarm
We'll find each other's arms
For your love, all you are
I'd start a riot

[Verse 2]
I will wade through the fire and smoke like sunlight through the haze
I will fight till the flag waves white until my dying days
Through the bombs and blasts
We will take it back

If your world falls apart
I'd start a riot
If night falls in your heart
I'd light the fire
In the dark, when you sound the alarm

Viva La VidaColdplay,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Don't Wanna FightAlabama Shakes,"[Verse 1]
Ooh
My line, your line
Don't cross them lines

Attacking, defending
Until there's nothing left, worth winning
Your pride and my pride
Don't waste my time

I take from my hand
Put in your hands
The fruit of all my grief
Lying down ain't easy
When everyone needs pleasing
I can't get no relief
Living ain't no fun
The constant dedication
Keeping the water and power on
There ain't no money left
Why can't I catch my breath?
I'm gonna work myself to death

ClocksColdplay,"[Verse 1]
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing—

[Chorus]
You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singin'

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing—

No, there ain't nothing that I gotta prove
You think your words will make me black and blue
But I, I think I'm pretty with these old boots on
I think it's funny when I drink too much, hey
You try and change me, you can go to hell
Cause I don't want to be nobody else
I like the chip I got in my front teeth
And I got bad tattoos you won't believe

[Pre-Chorus]
So kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock and roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight

[Chorus]
What do you want from me? I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me, I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they say I'm too loud for this town
So I lit a match and burned it down
What do you want from me, I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway

[Verse 2]
My hands are dirty and my heart is cold
The boys I've been with say I got no soul
When I, I meet another honey at the bar
I'll think it's funny when I break his heart, mmm now
My kind of medicine is whiskey straight
I got a mouth to put you in your place
And they, they said I'll never be the poster type
But they don't make posters of my kind of life

And in time
As one reminds the other of the past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?

A broken house
Another dry month waiting for the rain
And I had been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same

[Hook]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

[Verse 2]
Fragile sound
The world outside just watches as we crawl
Crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time

And so I cry
As I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?

[Hook]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

[Bridge]
Where I used to end was where you start
You were the only one
And now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one

[Verse 3]
Careful hands
And wandering without that much to say
Your words are empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Oh love, is there another way?

[Hook]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

Thomas said stay home

Keeping it secret
Taking your word for truth

Expect the worst of everyone I meet
Count the clock 'cause I can't fucking sleep
Shooting pain like a heart attack
Call my friends, I might not make it back

Unknown numbers been blowing up my phone
I'm hearing footsteps outside of my house
I'm afraid someone's trying to take me out

Can I fucking live?

Tried every door, don't know who I'm looking for
And I've made up my mind over and over

It's all the same sound and my ears are burning
In some strange home, don't know who I'm working for

Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody waiting
Getting sick of your surroundings
All you want is some attention

You can tell the truth
You can tell the lie
Say anything you want to say
Are we all just lost in time

Is there reason not to change
Stay the same, become a new thing
Walk backwards, step beyond
Never forget where we come from

You can tell the truth
You can tell the lie
Wonder with what anyone says
We will be alright

Fall down thinking about you

Where your horses run free

Let's Go CrazyPrince And The Revolution,"[Spoken Intro]
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!

Darling NikkiPrince And The Revolution,"[Verse 1]
I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said ""How'd you like to waste some time?""
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

[Verse 2]
She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

[Chorus]
Nikki

[Verse 3]
The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her loving will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sure enough, sure enough
Show you how to grind

[Chorus]
Darling Nikki, oh

[Verse 4]
Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you wanna grind

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikki, oh
Come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wants to grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'Cause I know

Hey

Just try your best
Try everything you can

Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride

The Sound Of SilenceSimon,"[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence."""

Took me a minute to clear my head
I try recalling, but the blanks won't fill
Camera was rolling, but I forgot the film

Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you could slow me down?
There ain't no turning back

It don't take much for the beast to bolt
A split second too late to bring it to a halt
You're hypnotized, your feet follow your shoes
It's kinda like, a cigarette smokin' you

When you start it's just a matter of time
Any minute you will cross that line

AmerikaYoung The Giant,"[Intro]
And so I've arrived
With gold in my eyes
Are you paying attention?

[Chorus 1]
I was searching for something as I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone? As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for

I've been looking for so long in America
Throw my hands in the air...

[Verse 1]
Flash faded
Say you care, but you don't
You know I hate it
It’s a rich kid game, didn't grow up with a throne— it's all it really is

[Chorus 2]
I was searching for something as I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone? As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for

Always talking about one day in America
Same old story, oh: you want glory, son
I've been looking for so long, but you cut me out
Throw my hands in the air 'cause I...

[Verse 2]
Your palace
All the friends you own
So jealous
Felt that rich kid pain, what it is to be alone— it’s all it really is

[Chorus 3]
I was searching for something as I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone? As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for

Always talking about one day in America
Same old story, oh: you want glory, son...

Falling from the sky, they're cast out from the heaven's light
Drenching the soil with blood, baptized in the fire hole

Descending angels and fallen kings

They gathered all the children outside the church
And never would they know what went on in there
Close the door and hear all the angels scream
""Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, oh mercy, please!""
Down, down, down
Down below you can hear his hoof digging through the ground
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord
The horned one is back and he wants his crown!

Descending angels and fallen kings
Raise your hands, what do you hold?

Ain't No ManThe Avett Brothers,"[Chorus]
There ain't no man-can save me
There ain't no man-can enslave me

Cause I got only love to share
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there

[Verse 1]
You got to serve something, ain't that right?
I know it gets dark, but there's always a light
You don't have to buy in to get into the club
Trade your worries

If it matters to you ma', it matters to me
I'm going to fall hard, yeah I know I am
When the clowns crack up, I laugh with them

[Verse 3]
You got to go somewhere, ain't that true?
Not a whole lotta time for me or you
Got a whole lotta reasons to be mad; let's not pick one
I live in a room at the top of the stairs
I got my windows wide open and nobody cares
And I got no choice but to get right up when the sun comes through

[Chorus]
Ain't no man-can save me
There ain't no man-can enslave me
There ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in
(That can change the shape my soul is in)
There ain't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear
Cause I got only love to share

If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there

To please her, make her want to stay in my arms she'd rest
But I don't have a sweetheart yet

It was a pistol, a Smith & Wesson, holy, holy shit

Already wear the scars

There's nowhere left to run

Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

The whispers turn into a scream
And I... I'm not coming home

Rescuing a tiger from a tree

Don't you say, don't you say it
Don't say, don't you say it
One breath, it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river

[Chorus]
Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver
Holy hands, will they make me a sinner?
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver
One last breath 'til the tears start to wither
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Like a river, like a river, sh-
Like a river, like a river, sh-
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Hey! Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh!
Hey! Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh! (Like a river)
Hey! Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! (Like a river)

Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver (Like a river, like a river)
Holy hands, will they make me a sinner? (Like a river, like a river)
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver (Like a river, like a river)
One last breath 'til the tears start to wither (Like a river, like a river)
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river"

Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up
Giddy up, giddy up

[Verse 1]
Wanna move into a fool's gold room
With my pulse on the animal jewels
Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose
With the luminous moves
Bored of these limits, let me get, let me get it like—

Live it once, can't live it twice

Smooth like a tidal wave, take you on a getaway

Livin' every day like it's just about to end
Now we're pissin' in the wind 'cause it's so pine fresh

It's your life
Falling like a hot knife
Call your wife; secular times, these times
My demon's on the cell phone
To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong
It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes, ""Boom,""
Standing on the lawn doin' jiu jitsu
Girl in a bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu

[Bridge]
It's your life
You gotta try to get it right
Look around, don't forget where you came from
It's just another perfect night
We're gonna take it around the world

We're gonna take it around the world
(Wow!)
Ride these wild horses

We're gonna take it around the world

Dear head, shut up
I can't listen no more
It's late, so shut up
Is one night too much to ask for?

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
You are a haunted house
You're superstitious
You are the coldest stone carved marble faces

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole"
So AliveGoo Goo Dolls,"[Verse 1]
Feeling like a hero, but I can't fly
No, you never crash if you don't try
Took it to the edge, now I know why
Never gonna live if you're too scared to die
Gonna disconnect from the hardwire
Time to raise a flag for the ceasefire
Staring down the hole inside me
Looking in the mirror
Making peace with the enemy

You can make it on a wish if you want to

Open up my heart like a shotgun
Blinded by the light of a new sun
Get up, get up, get out and get done
For the first time I feel like someone
Breaking down the walls in my own mind
Keeping my faith for the bad times
Get up, get up, stand like a champion
Take it to the world
Gonna sing it like an anthem

God, don't let me lose my mind

Trouble on my left, trouble on my right

We Turn RedRed Hot Chili Peppers,"[Intro]
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen

[Verse 1]
Lost my mind 'cause I'm on the plastic
Who knew it's so damn drastic
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all her teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans?
Do you want to get up early in the morning?
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

[Verse 2]
Mexico, you are my neighbor
Home of the let's be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago?
Trinidad's got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah, a desparado

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind
Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I'm the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide?

We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannonball
We turn red and we turn green

There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back

Asking For ItShinedown,"[Verse 1]
Can I have a moment of your time?
Just a single second so you see that indeed we’ll be leaving you behind Far across that line
Turn it up so you can hear the bells, crashing through the clouds as it rain down the drain
We know all too well, it’s a living hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Careful what you say and who you say and who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say it to

[Chorus]
Maybe you talk too much and you were asking for it, asking for it, asking
You can blame bad luck but you were asking for it, asking for it, asking
When all is said and done, you need to tie your tongue
'Cause when you spit on everyone
You are, you are, you know you're asking for it, asking for it, asking

[Verse 2]
Caught up in the gutter once again
Crashing through the mud, throwing lies, cutting ties 'til the sidewalk ends
And the truth begins
Power through the point of no return
Famously deranged all the same, hope you change if the world is gonna turn
It’s none of my concern

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Oooh hoo hoo oooh hoo hoo oh
Oooh hoo hoo oooh hoo hoo oh

You are, you are, you are, you are, you are, asking for it
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are, asking for it

You know you’re asking for it, asking for it
You know you’re asking for it, asking!"
WinterbreakMUNA,"[Verse 1]
You say I'd best be going cause it's getting late
And I say
Why don't I walk you home cause it's on the way
But the last time
That we made love, you left in tears
So this time
You're wondering how to leave it here
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that I broke your heart
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know that I took it hard

[Chorus]
Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

[Verse 2]
You pull
That face like, 'here we go again'
So I pull
A flask out the back of my jeans
And then you take a pull
And in my mind we're in my bed
And I'm pulling
Your sweater up over your head
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that you hate how that went
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know what's happening

[Chorus]
Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

[Bridge]
Oh it's magnetic, isn't it?
The sense of something underneath the surface
When you're laying on thin ice
Just a little bit masochistic
A tentative ellipses
The parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
But I think I'm gonna kiss you

[Chorus]
All despite
What we both know

This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try"

Cover up that you're ruthless
Nobody, nobody
Nobody's ever gonna notice
And I am catching on and I am seeing red
How about I prove I'm right
And raise it overhead?

Everything you do is a farce!

[Verse 1]
Talking television at the casual party
Here's some brand new friends to get you started off
So start it off
Since Ben got that he's a sociopath
He's only playing games, don't be distracted
It's all or nothing, all or nothing
So you really got something to lose
It's coming around as it did before
Or it's gettin' your attention, but where's the door
I can't locate it, where's it located?
I got plenty to live for

Blind faith don't sit right
You got rage, wound so tight
I wanna leave, best get out of the way

Awful conversation at the casual party
The jobs, babble on, the recreational hobbies
No, it never stops
Kids and the dog, a freshly mowed lawn
Retirement plans for a mountain home
Been arrested, lived in Texas

Life ItselfGlass Animals,"[Verse 1]
Daddy was dumb, said that I’d be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic

[Chorus]
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

[Verse 2]
I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe"

Singing oh, happiness
Singing oh, happiness

[Verse 1]
I got a homesick heart but a long ways left to go
I've been doing my part but I ain't got much to show
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

[Verse 2]
Chasing that life, moving on cause I had to prove
There ain't no life worth doing what I did to you
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

[Chorus]
I got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night
Telling me I wasn't made for the simple life
There's a light I see, but it's far in the distance
I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Singing oh, happiness
Singing oh, happiness

[Verse 3]
I've been working all night, maybe you could help me to believe
This song ain't nothing if this song can't set you free
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

I got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night
Telling me I wasn't made for the simple life
There's a light I see, but it's far in the distance
I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Singing oh, happiness
Singing oh, happiness

[Bridge]
Sometimes you leave the ones you love
But if it's love, they won't give up
'Cause they know a war's raging and you gotta choose
These days are tough, these days are long
Sometimes it's hard, you carry on
But I hear a voice singing and I know it's true

[Chorus]
I got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night
Telling me I wasn't made for the simple life
There's a light I see, but it's far in the distance
I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness, yeah

Singing oh, happiness (Happiness, happiness)
Oh, happiness (I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing)

There is a time, a time to cry

There is a time, a time to sing
A time to love

And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you

Why do I keep falling?

That's right, you're right, we will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It's time, you're fine, just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend we would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go, you show me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination

Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

Another place maybe another time

Complete repeat sittin' in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel, take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound, turn it up and no we can’t be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep, find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend

Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried

Burn The WitchRadiohead,"[Verse 1]
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up
This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes

[Chorus]
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live

[Verse 2]
Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes

Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live"

Life Can't Get Much BetterGood Charlotte,"[Verse 1]
One promise we made it
We said we’d never break it
Don’t look down be honest
Tell me has it changed
One life that we’re living
We’re somewhere unforgiven
Don’t look down be real now
Tell me has it changed
I just want to see you laugh again

[Chorus]
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay together
These scars are tokens of promises broken
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay forever
We’ve got to hold on we’ve waited so long

[Verse 2]
If I knew we’d end up this way
Do you really think I wouldn’t have tried
If I knew it would break us down
Do you really think I would’ve lied
Now I try to forget the past but it’s all that’s on my mind
I’d give it all if I could get you back
I’d give it all if you were mine
I just want to see you here sometime

[Chorus]
Cause life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay together
These scars are tokens of promises broken
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay forever
We’ve got to hold on we’ve waited so long

[Bridge]
Don’t give up on us, on us
Don’t give up on, on us
Tell me that you meant every word you said
In the text you sent I was going to bed
The girl with the blue eyes
With the blue eyes
It ain’t right it was fuckin’ with me last night

[Chorus]
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay together
These scars are tokens of promises broken
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay forever
We’ve got to hold on we’ve waited so long

Tell me that you meant every word you said
In the text you sent I was going to bed
The girl with the blue eyes
With the blue eyes
It ain’t right it was fuckin’ with me last night
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay together
These scars are tokens of promises broken"

That's All I NeedThe Dirty Heads,"[Verse]
When I was 12, I got baptized
But I've been runnin from Heaven since
Half the time, I wonder, ""Does it even exist?""
I constantly cross the line between pleasure and sin
I try, but sometimes, it seems I just can’t repent
I wonder if my Grandma's lookin down on me with a frown or a grin
Or maybe she's just dirt in the ground, and that’s how it ends
I was so strong in my beliefs as a kid
Now it feels wrong though to believe in this
It's been so long since Jesus made me see He exists
Why can't just send one sign, one time?
Please, just one line- that's all I need
And then I'm confined and reformed
Please, just bend the rules this one time
I need more
I need to know that you are out there listening
I need to know that there is something else
I need to know that there is more then glistening
I need to know that I'm not by myself
That's what the world wants to hear me say
But I know that I'm saved by eternal grace
And the day that I get to the pearly gates
My grandma’s gonna meet me and say my name
The world’s gotten so backwards
Everybody roots for you to fail
And God's the last thing that matters (We’ve got a pulse)
No wonder it's a living Hell! (What's goin on?)
Laying on this operating table- it's impossible to save me
And I’m probably fading into the dark
Hated for the thoughts that I'm saying
I know what confidence waiting
And my haters are praying I don't see tomorrow
Cause they know if I don't make it then I'm not in their way
And their journey to the top would be easier to make
But secretly they wanna peep into the operating procedure
Just to see if there is still a piece of my brain
And they can take it, but wouldn't know what to do with it
They're not creative enough to make the music I did
With the same beats, same bars, same rhymes, same flows
I would kill em all, but the fuckin' ruined the shit
And they're too stubborn to admit that I'm influencing them
Too busy judging me, while I'm making some moves in this bitch
Because I'm careful at who I choose who to include in this crypt
I'd rather be judged by 12, than be carried by 6
So many haters are waiting in the Emergency Room
They wanna see the doctor come out and say I'm not pullin through
Well, I'm pullin through, and the ER is crowded
There's so much noise but no damn talent
I lay down brain dead on the steel table
The top of my head's cut off- it's no fable
My toe tag has got no name label
My cold raps were just dang hateful, woo!
I think it's kinda funny- all these muthafuckas are waiting on me to die
But even if I die, I'm always livin in your mind
My name is Crypt, bitch- I've been dead this whole time
On the inside, when I'm writing my rhymes, bitch, it feels like I can almost fly
But then, I realize no one likes anytime that I spit
But fuck it- I keep it real cause it feels right
When I write down all of my rhymes
No matter what I do, somebody will cry
""You're too offensive, you're non-inclusive""
But it's none of your business how I write my music
Stop trynna change me to fit your vision- I won't do it, I will just refuse it
If you don't like it, then don't fuckin' listen
There's plenty other people out there that do this
No matter what I do, I should've zigged when I zagged
Everybody tells me, I should try something different
But when I do, they tell me that they miss how I rap
It's a catch 22 so, tell me, what's the difference?
If you do what you want, then I won't like it
If I do what I want, then you won't like it
If I do what they want, then no one likes it
The only option is to just stay silent!"

Well, the best kind of loving is the one that hurts
You can get your kicks, but I'll get mine first
I can take you down when the damned get wild
There's a whole lot of sinning but they're greener for miles
Three hits on the 6, there's a number that you dial
You can be like me but I'm a real brat child

UFO obliterate the way that I feel

You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it takes four
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is

[Chorus]
Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it takes four
You don't get me high anymore

[Outro]
(High anymore)
(You don't get me, you don't get me high anymore)
You don't get me high anymore
(High anymore)
(You don't get me, you don't get me high anymore)
You don't get me high anymore"
SoberBlink-182,"[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

[Verse 1: Matt Skiba]
I woke up in the pouring rain
West side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye
Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you really got me now
Black Sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober
When I'm sober
When I'm sober

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell on to the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside
And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me, then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

[Bridge]
Sober
Sober

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober
When I'm sober
When I'm sober
When I'm sober
When I'm sober"
Ashes Of EdenBreaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
Will the faithful be rewarded
When we come to the end?
Will I miss the final warning
From the lie that I have lived
Is there anybody calling?
I can see the soul within
And I am not worthy
I am not worthy of this

[Chorus]
Are you with me after all?
Why can't I hear you?
Are you with me through it all?
Then why can't I feel you?
Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the ashes of Eden fall

[Verse 2]
Will the darkness fall upon me
When the air is growing thin?
Will the light begin to pull me
To its everlasting will?
I can hear the voices haunting
There is nothing left to fear
And I am still calling
I am still calling to you

[Chorus]
Are you with me after all?
Why can't I hear you?
Are you with me through it all?
Then why can't I feel you?
Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the Ashes of Eden fall

[Outro]
Don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
Why can't I hear you?
Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the Ashes of Eden fall
Heaven above me, take my hand
(Stay with me, don't let me go)
Shine until there's nothing left but you
Heaven above me, take my hand
(Stay with me, don't let me go)
Shine until there's nothing left but you"
Take Me DownThe Pretty Reckless,"[Verse 1]
Been waitin' at these crossroads
Forever and a day
On a guy to buy my soul
I spend all night and day
How much harder can I play?
You know I gave my life to rock n' roll
Here we go

[Verse 2]
Mama begged me please
Yes, she got down on her knees
Said ""you'll burn in that Mississippi sun""
But I'm the only one that's standing here
So mama don't you have no fear
I'm either last or I've already won
Here I go

[Chorus]
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

[Verse 3]
Standing at the crossroads
A dried up pen in hand
The conversation went like this
""Tell me your desire why you pulled me from the fire and we'll seal the deal with a kiss""
Said ""I wanna raise the dead
Find a note that I can shred
On my walls I scrawl my gods
Don't care what happens when I die
As long as I'm alive
All I wanna do is rock, rock, rock""

[Chorus]
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

[Bridge]
Oh, sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!

[Chorus]
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

[Outro]
Take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil)
Take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil, oh)
Won't you take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil)

CynicalBlink-182,"[Prelude: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
You said everything you'll ever say
There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring
Anxiety's calling in my head
Is it back again? Are you back again?

[Verse: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
Don't wake me up before you leave
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed?
Woah, ohh
I feel your hand unlock the door
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil
Woah, ohh

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
What's the point of saying sorry now?
Lost my voice while fighting my way out
While fighting my way out
What's the point of saying sorry now?
Not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry
Lost my voice while fighting my way out
Not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now"
No FutureBlink-182,"[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
She said tonight's a waste of time
The next day the sun will always rise
Every day that you waste
Every promise you break
Slips beneath the floor
It's a permanent state
From a moment's mistake
But life's worth so much more

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
And they don't care about you
(No future!)
Let the music seal your fate, yeah
You can run, but life won't wait, yeah
They don't care about you
(No future!)

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
She said that it's too late to try
Someday I'll smile and say goodbye
Every night that you fight
Every demon in sight
Sleeping on the floor
Wide awake from the dream
With a shake and a scream
Hope for so much more

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
And they don't care about you
(No future!)
Let the music seal your fate, yeah
You can run, but life won't wait, yeah
They don't care about you
(No future!)

[Post Chorus: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
Na, na na, na na, na na na
Na, na na, na na, na na na
They don't care about you
Na, na na, na na, na na na
Na, na na, na na, na na na
They don't care about you

[Bridge: Matt Skiba]
Where did she go?
And what did she hope to find there?
Where did she go? (Where did she go, did she go?)
And what did she hope to find there?
Where did she go, did she go, did she go?
Where did she go to find it?
Where did she go, did she go, did she go?
Where did she go to find it?

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
And they don't care about you
(No future!)
Let the music seal your fate, yeah
You can run, but life won't wait, yeah
They don't care about you
(No future!)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
Na, na na, na na, na na na
Na, na na, na na, na na na
They don't care about you (They don't care)
Na, na na, na na, na na na
Na, na na, na na, na na na
They don't care about you (They don't care)"
I Was WrongA R I Z O N A,"[Verse 1]
Oh, I can see the doubt in those eyes
Even though you try to hide it
There’s not much to figure out
Cause I know why
And I won't try to fight it, try to fight it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ll be the first to tell you
You were right
Oh, you were right, oh, you were right
Won't try to say I'm sorry, this time

[Chorus]
But I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know
Oh I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know

[Verse 2]
Used to be so warm, those days
I try not to remember
I got lost in the storm of my ways
Couldn’t pull myself together, 'self together

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ll be the first to tell you, you were right
Oh, you were right, oh, you were right
Won't try to say I'm sorry, this time

[Chorus]
But I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know
Oh I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
And just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know

And I'll be the first to tell you, you were right
Oh you were right, oh you were right
Won't try to say I'm sorry this time
But I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know
Oh I want you to know that I was wrong
I know, I know
I just wanna say that I was wrong
I know, I know"
"Standing In The RainAction Bronson, Mark Ronson","[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand
And I'll never be the same

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
You can see me on the riviera dressed like a Playboy
Or you can catch me up in Rivieras Tuesday night
Pillow fights with Dominican mothers
That's what happens when theres suede on the roof
Swervin' lane to lane in a coupe
Shit, if I crash it, I'll probably just leave it as a token
That your boy coulda died right there, no jokin'
Uh, eating well so my foot's swollen
Fuck it man I'm rollin', you rollin' or not?
The boat plane's waiting at the dock
I wonder if he let me fly it, but it's a long shot
The money eases everybody's mind
Put kids through school, new titties on wives
New tits for the mistress
Fuck it, new titties for everybody, it's Christmas, yeah

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand
And I'll never be the same no

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I use milfhunter.com to ease the pain
It was ninety-two degrees with rain
Right before the seasons changed
On trees just a little bit of leaves remain
My heart broke when his cock was in your throat
But fuck that laid top out on the boat
Heard you fucked Ryan Philippine at 1 OAK
My man seen you both at the Sunoco
Kissing and touching, lied and said that this was your cousin
Shit, I should have known when you stole money
Bitch called the cop and rolled on me
So good, I got old money
To lay on any motherfucking beach on the planet
With equestrian colored salmon
We examine my life and make sure I'm never dumb again
But first, slide your panties to the side girl, I'm comin' in

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand and I'll never be the same, no
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand and I'll never be the same no"
This House Is Not For SaleBon Jovi,"[Verse 1]
These four walls have got a story to tell
Oh-oh, oh-oh
The door is off the hinges, there's no wish in the well
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Outside the sky is coal black, the streets are on fire
The picture window's cracked, and there's nowhere to run
I know, I know, this house is not for sale

[Chorus]
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

[Verse 2]
Drove a spike into the ground and I staked my claim
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Standing on the dirt where they'll dig my grave
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now what built these walls is in my veins
No time for lookin' back, the wolf is at the door
This heart, this soul, this house is not for sale

[Chorus]
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

[Bridge]
This house was built on trust
That's what it is, and always was
No wrecking ball could knock it down
This house was built on higher ground

[Chorus]
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

[Outro]
Coming home, I'm coming home
(This house is not for sale)
Coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm) coming home, I'm coming home
(This house is not for sale)"
Too Much Is Never EnoughFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
And the crown, it weighs heavy
'Til it's banging on my eyelids
Retreating in covers and closing the curtains
One thing's for certain, oh
A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, who decides from where up high?
I couldn't say ""I need more time""
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
Or one more day inside this life

[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough

[Verse 2]
Oh, you wondrous creature
Coming up who we are
'Cause I'm retreating in covers and closing the curtains
One thing's for certain, oh
A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And who decides from where up high?
(What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field)
I couldn't say ""I need more time""
([They all called my name?], felt it let go of me)
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
(What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field)
Or one more day inside this life
([They all called my name?], felt it let go of me)

[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough

[Bridge]
And who cares about the thing I did that night?
So what? Maybe Luna had it right
And who cares if I'm coming back alive?
So what? 'Least I have the strength to fight

[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough

[Outro]
What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field
[They all called my name?], felt it let go of me
What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field
[They all called my name?], felt it let go of me
A hundred flags flying in a field
[They all called my name?], felt it let go of me
What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field
[They all called my name?], felt it let go of me"
Medieval WarfareGrimes,"[Verse 1]
Baby I've been lookin' for a diamond
I could never touch it and it shines like ice
Everything is written in the sky and
Baby you can have it if you say it nice
Come on, baby, let's do somethin' ugly
Somethin' you would never touch yourself
Now let it bleed from me
I just wanna see it come out

[Chorus]
Are you big? Are you ugly?
Can you kill a man with your hands?
Are you hot? Do you want me?
Think I don't understand?

[Verse 2]
Baby I've been sleepin' with a rifle
Shotgun, grapeshot, tryptophobe
Baby I got somethin' you can stifle
Tie me, I won't leave
Come on, baby, let's do somethin' pretty
Somethin' you would never touch yourself
Just let it bleed from me
I just wanna make you come out

[Chorus]
Are you big? Are you ugly?
Can you kill a man with your hands?
Are you hot? Do you want me?
Think I don't understand?
Are you big? Are you ugly?
Can you kill a man with your hands?
Are you hot? Do you want me?
Think I don't understand?
Are you big? Are you ugly?
Can you kill a man with your hands?
Are you hot? Do you want me?
Think I don't understand?
Are you big? Are you ugly?
Can you kill a man with your hands?
Are you hot? Do you want me?
Think I don't understand?"

Rotting In VainKorn,"[Verse 1]
I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

[Chorus 1]
Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
You're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

[Chorus 2]
Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in…

[Bridge]
I can't hear this (scat singing)
I can't fuck it (scat singing)
I can't take this (scat singing)
I hate (scat singing)

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in…
Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain"

Gemini FeedBanks,"[Intro]
And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it, you just wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow, you could've kept my love

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes
There's nothing on my body left to see
I tried a thousand times
I tried to say ""I love you"", but you didn't hear me
And you're passive-aggressive
Convinced me other people, they don't care about me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're passive-aggressive
You're passive-aggressive
You're passive-aggressive, hey

[Chorus]
And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it, that you wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow, you could've kept my love

[Verse 2]
Ode to my two thighs
I still want you to kiss 'em 'cause they're lonely
And why you so surprised
That when I said ""I miss you"", you never believed me?
And we were so depressive
You and me together, we were Gemini feed

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And we were so depressive
We were so depressive
We were so depressive, hey

And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water

Take the anchors off my lungs
Take me broken and make me one
Break the silence and make it a song

[Chorus]
Life is short; I wanna live it well

And you're the one I'm living for
Awaken all my soul
Every breath that you take is a miracle
Life is short; I wanna live it well, yeah

Even if some notes come out right and some come out wrong
Cause I can't take none of that through the door
Yeah, I'm living for more than just a funeral
I wanna burn brighter than the dawn

Life is short; I wanna live it well

Joyride (Omen)Chevelle,"[Verse 1]
Oh, I've heard about the joyrides and I want in
It's fair to say it's in the past, if you're kidding
And you're kidding, and you're kidding
Like a God awful omen
Just hit, stabs like some voodoo hex
And like a seventh sign; one double cross
This is it
This is it

[Chorus 1]
Late night
This heart needs pumping
Joyride
And infamous lies

[Verse 2]
Angel eyes, gotta feed, taking aim, none of these
Pull right out
Didn't lie, didn't like, none of these
New revenge, odd events, catching hell, evidence
Chase you down

[Chorus 2]
Late night
This heart needs something
Joyride
And famous lies

[Bridge]
We almost always open up
We're almost always laughing over
Almost never open up
Chase them ghosts
Pigheaded
Your joyride

This heart needs pumping

And famous lies
Joyride, oh
And infamous lies"

Scream, with your hands up in the sky

Sing, like a rebel's lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated
We will be seen but not be heard

[Chorus]
We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control'
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline 'Legalize the truth'

[Verse 2]
Give me rage, like there’s tear gas in the crowd
Do you wanna live out loud?
But the air is barely breathing
Rise of the slums to the obsolete
The dawn of the new airwaves for the anti-social media

[Chorus]
We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control'
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline 'Legalize the truth'

We will be seen but not be heard
We are the songs of the disturbed

We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control'
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline

And the headline 'Legalize the truth'"

We can lay together
We're closer than we've ever been
Stay right here forever

Where we're going, that promised land
We made that promise, you gave me your hand
All that talkin', it pulled us in
Say you'd never leave, can we promise that?

Close these green eyes and watch over as I sleep
Through my darkest of dreams

Hold me closer than anyone before

HomeBlue October,"I'll smile if I want to
I'm not afraid, gonna flaunt it too
What a glow when you're living true
Yeah

I'm living for the right now
I had a few friends show me how
I take a deep breath and blow it out
Let it go

But listen, I
I can't wait to see what's around the corner
I can't wait to soar
Baby, I lie awake and I watch you sleeping, thinking
It's the little things that make a home

Like dancing in the kitchen in the pale moonlight
Only care in the world is that our kids are alright
Daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again
So smile at me, baby, take my breath away
With the good Lord willing, I'll be happy to say
That daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again

I feel like I'm gonna win
And I'm as proud as I've ever been
Cause I'm surrounded with some good friends
Yeah, good friends, good friends

I'm forever like a tattoo, yeah
I stay sticky 'cause I gotta be the glue for
My girl, my friends, my home, family, I do it all

Truly, I can't wait
To see what's around the corner
I can't wait to soar

That daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again

We found our home
Something we can build for years
The young and old
I'll be there to wipe your tears

We all get to see who we grow up to be
And anchor when in doubt, an ocean when in drought
We aim for it all, we lift up these walls
To make this house our home

Dancing in the kitchen in the pale moonlight
Only care in the world is that our kids are alright
Daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again
So smile at me, baby, take my breath away
With the good Lord willing, I'll be happy to say
That daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again

Dancing in the kitchen in the pale moonlight
Only care in the world is that our kids are alright
Daddy loves momma and momma loves him
Tomorrow, we get to do it over again
So smile at me, baby, take my breath away
With the good Lord willing, I'll be happy to say

Tomorrow, we get to do it over again"
American MoneyBORNS,"[Verse 1]
I was there when you fell from the clouds
And landed in the desert
There was a thunder inside of my heart
There was a wonderful pleasure
And like a stallion racin' the rain
You rode on the back of my bike
I knew from the song that you sang
You were my lover for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

[Verse 2]
So we took to the calico road
Running from the weather (Uh-oh)
There was a highway inside of her eyes
There was a buried treasure
And we got caught in the storm
You started flying a kite
At the end was the key to my heart
You were my lover for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's no time to sleep (There's no time to sleep)
Oh, living in a dream

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

[Bridge]
We carved our love in the mountainside
We soaked our hearts in the rain
And I, waited my whole life, for you

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money"

Drive around, night time, nowhere to go
Melt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes
Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low
And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this

[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it

[Verse 2]
Show me joy, flower through disarray
Let's destroy, each mistake that we made
Then restore the color back to the grey
There's no pride in sharing scars to prove it

[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it

[Bridge]
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it"

(When we leave this room it's gone)

[Verse 1]
Is the company stalling?
We had what we wanted: your eyes
(When we leave this room it's gone)
With no word from the former
I'd be happy as hell if you stayed for tea
(I know so well that this is all there is)
This is how we grow now, woman
A child ignored
These will just be places to me now
The foreman is down
(When we leave this room it's gone)
We're rising the stairs

[Pre-Chorus]
​I find God
And religion, too...

[Chorus]
Staying at the Ace Hotel
If the calm would allow
Then I would just be floating to you now
It would make me pass to let it pass on
I'm climbing the dash, that skin

[Post-Chorus]
(Here in this room, this narrow room
Where life began when we were young last night)

[Verse 2]
Well we walked up on that bolt in the street
After you tied me in in the driveway of the apartment of his bede
Sent your sister home in a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I woulda walked across any thousand lands
(No not really if you can't)
I didn't need you that night
Not gonna need you anytime
Was gonna take it as it goes
I could go forward in the light
Well I better fold my clothes

[Chorus]
(I've been looking through your mind)
All my goodness
(I've been looking through your mind)
(I've been looking through your mind)
All my goodness to show

"New Person, Same Old MistakesTame Impala","[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
I know, feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late) I know
(There's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I don't care, I'm in love

Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?

Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking that the only option)
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?

And I know it's hard to describe

Gotta break away

Exposed to the demons around you?

SuzanneLeonard Cohen,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On Our Lady of the Harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind"
The Show Must Go OnBilly Gilman,"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

PAUL GREGORY HOUSE, PETITIONER v. RICKY
BELL, WARDEN
on writ of certiorari to the united states court ofappeals for the sixth circuit
[June 12, 2006]

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

Some 20 years ago in rural Tennessee, Carolyn Muncey was murdered. A jury convicted petitioner Paul Gregory House of the crime and sentenced him to death, but new revelations cast doubt on the jury’s verdict. House, protesting his innocence, seeks access to federal court to pursue habeas corpus relief based on constitutional claims that are procedurally barred under state law. Out of respect for the finality of state-court judgments federal habeas courts, as a general rule, are closed to claims that state courts would consider defaulted. In certain exceptional cases involving a compelling claim of actual innocence, however, the state procedural default rule is not a bar to a federal habeas corpus petition. See Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 319–322 (1995) . After careful review of the full record, we conclude that House has made the stringent showing required by this exception; and we hold that his federal habeas action may proceed.

I

We begin with the facts surrounding Mrs. Muncey’s disappearance, the discovery of her body, and House’s arrest. Around 3 p.m. on Sunday, July 14, 1985, two local residents found her body concealed amid brush and tree branches on an embankment roughly 100 yards up the road from her driveway. Mrs. Muncey had been seen last on the evening before, when, around 8 p.m., she and her two children—Lora Muncey, age 10, and Matthew Muncey, age 8—visited their neighbor, Pam Luttrell. According to Luttrell, Mrs. Muncey mentioned her husband, William Hubert Muncey, Jr., known in the community as “Little Hube” and to his family as “Bubbie.” As Luttrell recounted Mrs. Muncey’s comment, Mr. Muncey “had gone to dig a grave, and he hadn’t come back, but that was all right, because [Mrs. Muncey] was going to make him take her fishing the next day,” App. 11–12. Mrs. Muncey returned home, and some time later, before 11:00 p.m. at the latest, Luttrell “heard a car rev its motor as it went down the road,” something Mr. Muncey customarily did when he drove by on his way home. Record, Addendum 4, 5 Tr. of Evidence in No. 378 (Crim. Ct. Union County, Tenn.) 641–642 (hereinafter Tr.). Luttrell then went to bed.

Around 1 a.m., Lora and Matthew returned to Luttrell’s home, this time with their father, Mr. Muncey, who said his wife was missing. Muncey asked Luttrell to watch the children while he searched for his wife. After he left, Luttrell talked with Lora. According to Luttrell:

“[Lora] said she heard a horn blow, she thought she heard a horn blow, and somebody asked if Bubbie was home, and her mama, you know, told them—no. And then she said she didn’t know if she went back to sleep or not, but then she heard her mama going down the steps crying and I am not sure if that is when she told me that she heard her mama say—oh God, no, not me, or if she told me that the next day, but I do know that she said she heard her mother going down the steps crying.” App. 14–15.

While Lora was talking, Luttrell recalled, “Matt kept butting in, you know, on us talking, and he said—sister they said daddy had a wreck, they said daddy had a wreck.” Id., at 13.

At House’s trial, Lora repeated her account of the night’s events, this time referring to the “wreck” her brother had mentioned. To assist in understanding Lora’s account, it should be noted that Mrs. Muncey’s father-in-law—Little Hube’s father—was sometimes called “Big Hube.” Lora and her brother called him “Paw Paw.” We refer to him as Mr. Muncey, Sr. According to Lora, Mr. Muncey, Sr. had a deep voice, as does petitioner House.

Lora testified that after leaving Luttrell’s house with her mother, she and her brother “went to bed.” Id., at 18. Later, she heard someone, or perhaps two different people, ask for her mother. Lora’s account of the events after she went to bed was as follows:

“Q    Laura [sic], at some point after you got back home and you went to bed, did anything happen that caused your mother to be upset or did you hear anything?

“A    Well, it sounded like PawPaw said—where’s daddy at, and she said digging a grave.

“Q    Okay. Do you know if it was PawPaw or not, or did it sound like PawPaw?

“A    It just sounded like PawPaw.

“Q    And your mother told him what?

“A    That he was digging a grave.

“Q    Had you ever heard that voice before that said that?

“A    I don’t remember.

“Q    After that, at some point later, did you hear anything else that caused your mother to be upset?

“A    Well, they said that daddy had a wreck down the road and she started crying—next to the creek.

“Q    Your mother started crying. What was it that they said?

“A    That daddy had a wreck.

“Q    Did they say where?

“A    Down there next to the creek.” Id., at 18–19.

Lora did not describe hearing any struggle. Some time later, Lora and her brother left the house to look for their mother, but no one answered when they knocked at the Luttrells’ home, and another neighbor, Mike Clinton, said he had not seen her. After the children returned home, according to Lora, her father came home and “fixed him a bologna sandwich and he took a bit of it and he says—sissy, where is mommy at, and I said—she ain’t been here for a little while.” Id., at 20. Lora recalled that Mr. Muncey went outside and, not seeing his wife, returned to take Lora and Matthew to the Luttrells’ so that he could look further.

The next afternoon Billy Ray Hensley, the victim’s first cousin, heard of Mrs. Muncey’s disappearance and went to look for Mr. Muncey. As he approached the Munceys’ street, Hensley allegedly “saw Mr. House come out from under a bank, wiping his hands on a black rag.” Id., at 32. Just when and where Hensley saw House, and how well he could have observed him, were disputed at House’s trial. Hensley admitted on cross-examination that he could not have seen House “walking up or climbing up” the embankment, id., at 39; rather, he saw House, in “[j]ust a glance,” id., at 40, “appear out of nowhere,” “next to the embankment,” id., at 39. On the Munceys’ street, opposite the area where Hensley said he saw House, a white Plymouth was parked near a sawmill. Another witness, Billy Hankins, whom the defense called, claimed that around the same time he saw a “boy” walking down the street away from the parked Plymouth and toward the Munceys’ home. This witness, however, put the “boy” on the side of the street with the parked car and the Munceys’ driveway, not the side with the embankment.

Hensley, after turning onto the Munceys’ street, continued down the road and turned into their driveway. “I pulled up in the driveway where I could see up toward Little Hube’s house,” Hensley testified, “and I seen Little Hube’s car wasn’t there, and I backed out in the road, and come back [the other way].” Id., at 32. As he traveled up the road, Hensley saw House traveling in the opposite direction in the white Plymouth. House “flagged [Hensley] down” through his windshield, ibid., and the two cars met about 300 feet up the road from the Munceys’ driveway. According to Hensley, House said he had heard Mrs. Muncey was missing and was looking for her husband. Id., at 33. Though House had only recently moved to the area, he was acquainted with the Munceys, had attended a dance with them, and had visited their home. He later told law enforcement officials he considered both of the Munceys his friends. According to Hensley, House said he had heard that Mrs. Muncey’s husband, who was an alcoholic, was elsewhere “getting drunk.” Ibid.

As Hensley drove off, he “got to thinking to [him]self—he’s hunting Little Hube, and Little Hube drunk—what would he be doing off that bank … .” Ibid. His suspicion aroused, Hensley later returned to the Munceys’ street with a friend named Jack Adkins. The two checked different spots on the embankment, and though Hensley saw nothing where he looked, Adkins found Mrs. Muncey. Her body lay across from the sawmill near the corner where House’s car had been parked, dumped in the woods a short way down the bank leading toward a creek.

Around midnight, Dr. Alex Carabia, a practicing pathologist and county medical examiner, performed an autopsy. Dr. Carabia put the time of death between 9 and 11 p.m. Mrs. Muncey had a black eye, both her hands were bloodstained up to the wrists, and she had bruises on her legs and neck. Dr. Carabia described the bruises as consistent with a “traumatic origin,” i.e., a fight or a fall on hard objects. 7 id., at 985–986. Based on the neck bruises and other injuries, he concluded Mrs. Muncey had been choked, but he ruled this out as the cause of death. The cause of death, in Dr. Carabia’s view, was a severe blow to the left forehead that inflicted both a laceration penetrating to the bone and, inside the skull, a severe right-side hemorrhage, likely caused by Mrs. Muncey’s brain slamming into the skull opposite the impact. Dr. Carabia described this head injury as consistent either with receiving a blow from a fist or other instrument or with striking some object.

The county sheriff, informed about Hensley’s earlier encounter with House, questioned House shortly after the body was found. That evening, House answered further questions during a voluntary interview at the local jail. Special Agent Ray Presnell of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) prepared a statement of House’s answers, which House signed. Asked to describe his whereabouts on the previous evening, House claimed—falsely, as it turned out—that he spent the entire evening with his girlfriend, Donna Turner, at her trailer. Asked whether he was wearing the same pants he had worn the night before, House replied—again, falsely—that he was. House was on probation at the time, having recently been released on parole following a sentence of five years to life for aggravated sexual assault in Utah. House had scratches on his arms and hands, and a knuckle on his right ring finger was bruised. He attributed the scratches to Turner’s cats and the finger injury to recent construction work tearing down a shed. The next day House gave a similar statement to a different TBI agent, Charles Scott.

In fact House had not been at Turner’s home. After initially supporting House’s alibi, Turner informed authorities that House left her trailer around 10:30 or 10:45 p.m. to go for a walk. According to Turner’s trial testimony, House returned later—she was not sure when—hot and panting, missing his shirt and his shoes. House, Turner testified, told her that while he was walking on the road near her home, a vehicle pulled up beside him, and somebody inside “called him some names and then they told him he didn’t belong here anymore.” App. 89. House said he tried to ignore the taunts and keep walking, but the vehicle pulled in behind him, and “one of them got out and grabbed him by the shoulder … and [House] swung around with his right hand” and “hit something.” Ibid. According to Turner, House said “he took off down the bank and started running and he said that he—he said it seemed forever where he was running. And he said they fired two shots at him while he took off down the bank … .” Ibid. House claimed the assailants “grabbed ahold of his shirt,” which Turner remembered as “a blue tank top, trimmed in yellow,” and “they tore it to where it wouldn’t stay on him and he said—I just throwed it off when I was running.” Id., at 91. Turner, noticing House’s bruised knuckle, asked how he hurt it, and House told her “that’s where he hit.” Id., at 90. Turner testified that she “thought maybe my ex-husband had something to do with it.” Ibid.

Although the white Plymouth House drove the next day belonged to Turner, Turner insisted House had not used the car that night. No forensic evidence connected the car to the crime; law enforcement officials inspected a white towel covering the driver seat and concluded it was clean. Turner’s trailer was located just under two miles by road, through hilly terrain, from the Muncey residence.

Law enforcement officers also questioned the victim’s husband. Though Mrs. Muncey’s comments to Luttrell gave no indication she knew this, Mr. Muncey had spent the evening at a weekly dance at a recreation center roughly a mile and a half from his home. In his statement to law enforcement—a statement House’s trial counsel claims he never saw—Mr. Muncey admitted leaving the dance early, but said it was only for a brief trip to the package store to buy beer. He also stated that he and his wife had had sexual relations Saturday morning.

Late in the evening on Monday, July 15—two days after the murder—law enforcement officers visited Turner’s trailer. With Turner’s consent, Agent Scott seized the pants House was wearing the night Mrs. Muncey disappeared. The heavily soiled pants were sitting in a laundry hamper; years later, Agent Scott recalled noticing “reddish brown stains” he “suspected” were blood. Id., at 274–275. Around 4 p.m. the next day, two local law enforcement officers set out for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D. C., with House’s pants, blood samples from the autopsy, and other evidence packed together in a box. They arrived at 2:00 a.m. the next morning. On July 17, after initial FBI testing revealed human blood on the pants, House was arrested.

II

The State of Tennessee charged House with capital murder. At House’s trial, the State presented testimony by Luttrell, Hensley, Adkins, Lora Muncey, Dr. Carabia, the sheriff, and other law enforcement officials. Through TBI Agents Presnell and Scott, the jury learned of House’s false statements. Central to the State’s case, however, was what the FBI testing showed—that semen consistent (or so it seemed) with House’s was present on Mrs. Muncey’s nightgown and panties, and that small bloodstains consistent with Mrs. Muncey’s blood but not House’s appeared on the jeans belonging to House.

Regarding the semen, FBI Special Agent Paul Bigbee, a serologist, testified that the source was a “secretor,” meaning someone who “secrete[s] the ABO blood group substances in other body fluids, such as semen and saliva”—a characteristic shared by 80 percent of the population, including House. Id., at 55. Agent Bigbee further testified that the source of semen on the gown was blood-type A, House’s own blood type. As to the semen on the panties, Agent Bigbee found only the H blood-group substance, which A and B blood-type secretors secrete along with substances A and B, and which O-type secretors secrete exclusively. Agent Bigbee explained, however—using science an amicus here sharply disputes, see Brief for Innocence Project, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 24–26—that House’s A antigens could have “degraded” into H, App. 57–58. Agent Bigbee thus concluded that both semen deposits could have come from House, though he acknowledged that that the H antigen could have come from Mrs. Muncey herself if she was a secretor—something he “was not able to determine,” id., at 58—and that, while Mr. Muncey was himself blood-type A (as was his wife), Agent Bigbee was again “not able to determine his secretor status,” id., at 57. Agent Bigbee acknowledged on cross-examination that “a saliva sample” would have sufficed to determine whether Mr. Muncey was a secretor; the State did not provide such a sample, though it did provide samples of Mr. Muncey’s blood. Id., at 62.

As for the blood, Agent Bigbee explained that “spots of blood” appeared “on the left outside leg, the right bottom cuff, on the left thigh and in the right inside pocket and on the lower pocket on the outside.” Id., at 48. Agent Bigbee determined that the blood’s source was type A (the type shared by House, the victim, and Mr. Muncey). He also successfully tested for the enzyme phosphoglucomutase and the blood serum haptoglobin, both of which “are found in all humans” and carry “slight chemical differences” that vary genetically and “can be grouped to differentiate between two individuals if those types are different.” Id., at 49–50. Based on these chemical traces and on the A blood type, Agent Bigbee determined that only some 6.75 percent of the population carry similar blood, that the blood was “consistent” with Mrs. Muncey’s (as determined by testing autopsy samples), and that it was “impossible” that the blood came from House. Id., at 48–52.

A different FBI expert, Special Agent Chester Blythe, testified about fiber analysis performed on Mrs. Muncey’s clothes and on House’s pants. Although Agent Blythe found blue jean fibers on Mrs. Muncey’s nightgown, brassier, housecoat, and panties, and in fingernail scrapings taken from her body (scrapings that also contained trace, unidentifiable amounts of blood), he acknowledged that, as the prosecutor put it in questioning the witness, “blue jean material is common material,” so “this doesn’t mean that the fibers that were all over the victim’s clothing were necessarily from [House’s] pair of blue jeans.” 6 Tr. 864–865. On House’s pants, though cotton garments both transfer and retain fibers readily, Agent Blythe found neither hair nor fiber consistent with the victim’s hair or clothing.

In the defense case House called Hankins, Clinton, and Turner, as well as House’s mother, who testified that House had talked to her by telephone around 9:30 p.m. on the night of the murder and that he had not used her car that evening. House also called the victim’s brother, Ricky Green, as a witness. Green testified that on July 2, roughly two weeks before the murder, Mrs. Muncey called him and “said her and Little Hube had been into it and she said she was wanting to leave Little Hube, she said she was wanting to get out—out of it, and she was scared.” 7 id., at 1088. Green recalled that at Christmastime in 1982 he had seen Mr. Muncey strike Mrs. Muncey after returning home drunk.

As Turner informed the jury, House’s shoes were found several months after the crime in a field near her home. Turner delivered them to authorities. Though the jury did not learn of this fact (and House’s counsel claims he did not either), the State tested the shoes for blood and found none. House’s shirt was not found.

The State’s closing argument suggested that on the night of her murder, Mrs. Muncey “was deceived … . She had been told [her husband] had had an accident.” 9 id., at 1226. The prosecutor emphasized the FBI’s blood analysis, noting that “after running many, many, many tests,” Agent Bigbee:

“was able to tell you that the blood on the defendant’s blue jeans was not his own blood, could not be his own blood. He told you that the blood on the blue jeans was consistent with every characteristic in every respect of the deceased’s, Carolyn Muncey’s, and that ninety-three (93%) percent of the white population would not have that blood type… . He can’t tell you one hundred (100%) percent for certain that it was her blood. But folks, he can sure give you a pretty good—a pretty good indication.” Id., at 1235–1236.

In the State’s rebuttal, after defense counsel questioned House’s motive “to go over and kill a woman that he barely knew[,] [w]ho was still dressed, still clad in her clothes,” Id., at 1274, the prosecutor referred obliquely to the semen stains. While explaining that legally “it does not make any difference under God’s heaven, what the motive was,” App. 106, the prosecutor told the jury, “you may have an idea why he did it,” ibid.:

“The evidence at the scene which seemed to suggest that he was subjecting this lady to some kind of indignity, why would you get a lady out of her house, late at night, in her night clothes, under the trick that her husband has had a wreck down by the creek? … Well, it is because either you don’t want her to tell what indignities you have subjected her to, or she is unwilling and fights against you, against being subjected to those indignities. In other words, it is either to keep her from telling what you have done to her, or it is that you are trying to get her to do something that she nor any mother on that road would want to do with Mr. House, under those conditions, and you kill her because of her resistance. That is what the evidence at the scene suggests about motive.” Id., at 106–107.

In addition the government suggested the black rag Hensley said he saw in House’s hands was in fact the missing blue tank top, retrieved by House from the crime scene. And the prosecution reiterated the importance of the blood. “[D]efense counsel,” he said, “does not start out discussing the fact that his client had blood on his jeans on the night that Carolyn Muncey was killed… . He doesn’t start with the fact that nothing that the defense has introduced in this case explains what blood is doing on his jeans, all over his jeans, that is scientifically, completely different from his blood.” Id., at 104–105. The jury found House guilty of murder in the first degree.

The trial advanced to the sentencing phase. As aggravating factors to support a capital sentence, the State sought to prove: (1) that House had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence; (2) that the homicide was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind; and (3) that the murder was committed while House was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing from the commission of, rape or kidnaping. See Tenn. Code Ann. §§39–2–203(i)(2), (5), (7) (1982) (repealed 1989); compare §§39–13–204(i)(2), (5), (7) (2003). After presenting evidence of House’s parole status and aggravated sexual assault conviction, the State rested. As mitigation, the defense offered testimony from House’s father and mother, as well as evidence, presented through House’s mother, that House attempted suicide after the guilt-phase verdict. Before the attempt House wrote his mother a letter professing his innocence.

In closing the State urged the jury to find all three aggravating factors and impose death. As to the kidnaping or rape factor, the prosecution suggested Mrs. Muncey was “decoy[ed] or entic[ed] … away from her family, and confin[ed] her against her will because you know that as she was being beaten to death.” 10 Tr. 1410. “We also think,” the prosecutor added, “the proof shows strong evidence of attempted sexual molestation of the victim to accompany the taking away and murdering her.” Id., at 1410–1411. Later the prosecutor argued, “I think the proof shows in the record that it is more likely than not that having been through the process before and having been convicted of a crime involving the threat of violence, or violence to another person, aggravated sexual assault, that the defendant cannot benefit from the type of rehabilitation that correction departments can provide.” Id., at 1413. The jury unanimously found all three aggravating factors and concluded “there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to outweigh the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances.” Id., at1454. The jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial judge imposed.

III

The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed House’s conviction and sentence, describing the evidence against House as “circumstantial” but “quite strong.” State v. House, 743 S. W. 2d 141, 143, 144 (1987). Two months later, in a state trial court, House filed a pro se petition for postconviction relief, arguing he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. The court appointed counsel, who amended the petition to raise other issues, including a challenge to certain jury instructions. At a hearing before the same judge who conducted the trial, House’s counsel offered no proof beyond the trial transcript. The trial court dismissed the petition, deeming House’s trial counsel adequate and overruling House’s other objections. On appeal House’s attorney renewed only the jury-instructions argument. In an unpublished opinion the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, and both the Tennessee Supreme Court and this Court, House v. Tennessee, 498 U. S. 912 (1990) , denied review.

House filed a second postconviction petition in state court reasserting his ineffective-assistance claim and seeking investigative and/or expert assistance. After extensive litigation regarding whether House’s claims were procedurally defaulted the Tennessee Supreme Court held that House’s claims were barred under a state statute providing that claims not raised in prior postconviction proceedings are presumptively waived, Tenn. Code Ann. §40–30–112 (1990) (repealed 1995), and that courts may not consider grounds for relief “which the court finds should be excluded because they have been waived or previously determined,” §40–30–111 (repealed 1995). See House v. State, 911 S. W. 2d 705 (Tenn. 1995). This Court denied certiorari. House v. Tennessee, 517 U. S. 1193 (1996) .

House next sought federal habeas relief, asserting numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, though deeming House’s claims procedurally defaulted and granting summary judgment to the State on the majority of House’s claims, held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether House fell within the “actual innocence” exception to procedural default that this Court recognized as to substantive offenses in Schlup and as to death sentences in Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992) . Presenting evidence we describe in greater detail below, House attacked the semen and blood evidence used at his trial and presented other evidence, including a putative confession, suggesting that Mr. Muncey, not House, committed the murder. The District Court nevertheless denied relief, holding that House had neither demonstrated actual innocence of the murder under Schlup nor established that he was ineligible for the death penalty under Sawyer.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a certificate of appealability under 28 U. S. C. §2253(c) as to all claims in the habeas petition. On the merits a divided panel affirmed, but its opinion was withdrawn and the case taken en banc. A divided en banc court certified state-law questions to the Tennessee Supreme Court. House v. Bell, 311 F. 3d 767 (CA6 2002). Concluding that House had made a compelling showing of actual innocence, and recognizing that in Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390 (1993) , this Court assumed without deciding that “in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of ‘actual innocence’ made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenue open to process such a claim,” id., at 417, the six-judge majority certified questions to the State Supreme Court, 311 F. 3d, at 777–778. The questions sought “to ascertain whether there remains a ‘state avenue open to process such a claim’ in this case.” Id., at 768. Four dissenting judges argued the court should have reached the merits, rather than certifying questions to the state court; these judges asserted that House could not obtain relief under Schlup, let alone Sawyer and Herrera. 311 F. 3d,at 780–781 (Boggs, J., dissenting). A fifth dissenter explained that while he agreed with the majority that House “presents a strong claim for habeas relief, at least at the sentencing phase of the case,” he objected to the certification of questions to the Tennessee high court. Id., at 787 (opinion of Gilman, J.). This Court denied certiorari. Bell v. House, 539 U. S. 937 (2003) .

The State urged the Tennessee Supreme Court not to answer the Court of Appeals’ certified questions, and the state court did not do so. The case returned to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. This time an eight-judge majority affirmed the District Court’s denial of habeas relief. 386 F. 3d 668 (2004). Six dissenters argued that House not only had met the actual innocence standard for overcoming procedural default but also was entitled to immediate release under Herrera. 386 F. 3d, at 708 (Merritt, J., dissenting). A seventh dissenter (the same judge who wrote separately in the previous en banc decision) described the case as “a real-life murder mystery, an authentic ‘who-done-it’ where the wrong man may be executed.” Id., at 709 (opinion of Gilman, J.). He concluded such grave uncertainty necessitated relief in the form of a new trial for House. Id., at 710.

We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. ___ (2005), and now reverse.

IV

As a general rule, claims forfeited under state law may support federal habeas relief only if the prisoner demonstrates cause for the default and prejudice from the asserted error. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 485 (1986) ; Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129 (1982) ; Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977) . The rule is based on the comity and respect that must be accorded to state-court judgments. See, e.g., Engle, supra, at 126–129; Wainwright, supra, at 89–90. The bar is not, however, unqualified. In an effort to “balance the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case,” Schlup, 513 U. S., at 324, the Court has recognized a miscarriage-of-justice exception. “ ‘[I]n appropriate cases,’ ” the Court has said, “the principles of comity and finality that inform the concepts of cause and prejudice ‘must yield to the imperative of correcting a fundamentally unjust incarceration,’ ” Carrier, supra, at 495 (quoting Engle, supra, at 135).

In Schlup, the Court adopted a specific rule to implement this general principle. It held that prisoners asserting innocence as a gateway to defaulted claims must establish that, in light of new evidence, “it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” 513 U. S., at 327. This formulation, Schlup explains, “ensures that petitioner’s case is truly ‘extraordinary,’ while still providing petitioner a meaningful avenue by which to avoid a manifest injustice.” Ibid. (quoting McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 494 (1991) ). In the usual case the presumed guilt of a prisoner convicted in state court counsels against federal review of defaulted claims. Yet a petition supported by a convincing Schlup gateway showing “raise[s] sufficient doubt about [the petitioner’s] guilt to undermine confidence in the result of the trial without the assurance that that trial was untainted by constitutional error”; hence, “a review of the merits of the constitutional claims” is justified. 513 U. S.,at 317.

For purposes of this case several features of the Schlup standard bear emphasis. First, although “[t]o be credible” a gateway claim requires “new reliable evidence—whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence—that was not presented at trial,” id., at 324, the habeas court’s analysis is not limited to such evidence. There is no dispute in this case that House has presented some new reliable evidence; the State has conceded as much, see infra, at 20–21. In addition, because the District Court held an evidentiary hearing in this case, and because the State does not challenge the court’s decision to do so, we have no occasion to elaborate on Schlup’s observation that when considering an actual-innocence claim in the context of a request for an evidentiary hearing, the District Court need not “test the new evidence by a standard appropriate for deciding a motion for summary judgment,” but rather may “consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of the affiants bear on the probable reliability of that evidence.” 513 U. S., at 331–332. Our review in this case addresses the merits of the Schlup inquiry, based on a fully developed record, and with respect to that inquiry Schlup makes plain that the habeas court must consider “ ‘all the evidence,’ ” old and new, incriminating and exculpatory, without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under “rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.” See id., at 327–328 (quoting Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970)). Based on this total record, the court must make “a probabilistic determination about what reasonable, properly instructed jurors would do.” 513 U. S., at 329. The court’s function is not to make an independent factual determination about what likely occurred, but rather to assess the likely impact of the evidence on reasonable jurors. Ibid.

Second, it bears repeating that the Schlup standard is demanding and permits review only in the “ ‘extraordinary’ ” case. Id., at 327 (quoting Zant, supra, at 494); see also 513 U. S., at 324 (emphasizing that “in the vast majority of cases, claims of actual innocence are rarely successful”). At the same time, though, the Schlup standard does not require absolute certainty about the petitioner’s guilt or innocence. A petitioner’s burden at the gateway stage is to demonstrate that more likely than not, in light of the new evidence, no reasonable juror would find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt—or, to remove the double negative, that more likely than not any reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt.

Finally, as the Schlup decision explains, the gateway actual-innocence standard is “by no means equivalent to the standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979) ,” which governs claims of insufficient evidence. Id., at 330. When confronted with a challenge based on trial evidence, courts presume the jury resolved evidentiary disputes reasonably so long as sufficient evidence supports the verdict. Because a Schlup claim involves evidence the trial jury did not have before it, the inquiry requires the federal court to assess how reasonable jurors would react to the overall, newly supplemented record. See ibid. If new evidence so requires, this may include consideration of “the credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.” Ibid.; see also ibid. (noting that “[i]n such a case,the habeas court may have to make some credibilityassessments”).

As an initial matter, the State argues that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, has replaced the Schlup standard with a stricter test based on Sawyer, which permits consideration of successive, abusive, or defaulted sentencing-related claims only if the petitioner “show[s] by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law,” 505 U. S., at 336. One AEDPA provision establishes a similar standard for second or successive petitions involving no retroactively applicable new law, 28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii); another sets it as a threshold for obtaining an evidentiary hearing on claims the petitioner failed to develop in state court, §2254(e)(2). Neither provision addresses the type of petition at issue here—a first federal habeas petition seeking consideration of defaulted claims based on a showing of actual innocence. Thus, the standard of review in these provisions is inapplicable. Cf. Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 324 (1996) (“[D]ismissal of a first federal habeas petition is a particularly serious matter”).

The State also argues that the District Court’s findings in this case tie our hands, precluding a ruling in House’s favor absent a showing of clear error as to the District Court’s specific determinations. This view overstates the effect of the District Court’s ruling. Deference is given to a trial court’s assessment of evidence presented to it in the first instance. Yet the Schlup inquiry, we repeat, requires a holistic judgment about “ ‘all the evidence,’ ” 513 U. S., at 328 (quoting Friendly, supra, at 160), and its likely effect on reasonable jurors applying the reasonable-doubt standard. As a general rule, the inquiry does not turn on discrete findings regarding disputed points of fact, and “[i]t is not the district court’s independent judgment as to whether reasonable doubt exists that the standard addresses,”513 U. S., at 329. Here, although the District Court attentively managed complex proceedings, carefully reviewed the extensive record, and drew certain conclusions about the evidence, the court did not clearly apply Schlup’s predictive standard regarding whether reasonable jurors would have reasonable doubt. As we shall explain, moreover, we are uncertain about the basis for some of the District Court’s conclusions—a consideration that weakens our reliance on its determinations.

With this background in mind we turn to the evidence developed in House’s federal habeas proceedings.

DNA Evidence

First, in direct contradiction of evidence presented at trial, DNA testing has established that the semen on Mrs. Muncey’s nightgown and panties came from her husband, Mr. Muncey, not from House. The State, though conceding this point, insists this new evidence is immaterial. At the guilt phase at least, neither sexual contact nor motive were elements of the offense, so in the State’s view the evidence, or lack of evidence, of sexual assault or sexual advance is of no consequence. We disagree. In fact we consider the new disclosure of central importance.

From beginning to end the case is about who committed the crime. When identity is in question, motive is key. The point, indeed, was not lost on the prosecution, for it introduced the evidence and relied on it in the final guilt-phase closing argument. Referring to “evidence at the scene,” the prosecutor suggested that House committed, or attempted to commit, some “indignity” on Mrs. Muncey that neither she “nor any mother on that road would want to do with Mr. House.” 9 Tr. 1302–1303. Particularly in a case like this where the proof was, as the State Supreme Court observed, circumstantial, State v. House, 743 S. W. 2d, at 143, 144, we think a jury would have given this evidence great weight. Quite apart from providing proof of motive, it was the only forensic evidence at the scene that would link House to the murder.

Law and society, as they ought to do, demand accountability when a sexual offense has been committed, so not only did this evidence link House to the crime; it likely was a factor in persuading the jury not to let him go free. At sentencing, moreover, the jury came to the unanimous conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the murder was committed in the course of a rape or kidnaping. The alleged sexual motivation relates to both those determinations. This is particularly so given that, at the sentencing phase, the jury was advised that House had a previous conviction for sexual assault.

A jury informed that fluids on Mrs. Muncey’s garments could have come from House might have found that House trekked the nearly two miles to the victim’s home and lured her away in order to commit a sexual offense. By contrast a jury acting without the assumption that the semen could have come from House would have found it necessary to establish some different motive, or, if the same motive, an intent far more speculative. When the only direct evidence of sexual assault drops out of the case, so, too, does a central theme in the State’s narrative linking House to the crime. In that light, furthermore, House’s odd evening walk and his false statements to authorities, while still potentially incriminating, might appear less suspicious.

Bloodstains

The other relevant forensic evidence is the blood on House’s pants, which appears in small, even minute, stains in scattered places. As the prosecutor told the jury, they were stains that, due to their small size, “you or I might not detect[,] [m]ight not see, but which the FBI lab was able to find on [House’s] jeans.” App. 11. The stains appear inside the right pocket, outside that pocket, near the inside button, on the left thigh and outside leg, on the seat of the pants, and on the right bottom cuff, including inside the pants. Due to testing by the FBI, cuttings now appear on the pants in several places where stains evidently were found. (The cuttings were destroyed in the testing process, and defense experts were unable to replicate the tests.) At trial, the government argued “nothing that the defense has introduced in this case explains what blood is doing on his jeans, all over [House’s] jeans, that is scientifically, completely different from his blood.” Id., at 105. House, though not disputing at this point that the blood is Mrs. Muncey’s, now presents an alternative explanation that, if credited, would undermine the probative value of the blood evidence.

During House’s habeas proceedings, Dr. Cleland Blake, an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Tennessee and a consultant in forensic pathology to the TBI for 22 years, testified that the blood on House’s pants was chemically too degraded, and too similar to blood collected during the autopsy, to have come from Mrs. Muncey’s body on the night of the crime. The blood samples collected during the autopsy were placed in test tubes without preservative. Under such conditions, according to Dr. Blake, “you will have enzyme degradation. You will have different blood group degradation, blood marker degradation.” Record, Doc. 275, p. 80 (hereinafter R275:80). The problem of decay, moreover, would have been compounded by the body’s long exposure to the elements, sitting outside for the better part of a summer day. In contrast, if blood is preserved on cloth, “it will stay there for years,” ibid.; indeed, Dr. Blake said he deliberately places blood drops on gauze during autopsies to preserve it for later testing. The blood on House’s pants, judging by Agent Bigbee’s tests, showed “similar deterioration, breakdown of certain of the named numbered enzymes” as in the autopsy samples. Id., at 110. “[I]f the victim’s blood had spilled on the jeans while the victim was alive and this blood had dried,” Dr. Blake stated, “the deterioration would not have occurred,” ibid., and “you would expect [the blood on the jeans] to be different than what was in the tube,” id., at 113. Dr. Blake thus concluded the blood on the jeans came from the autopsy samples, not from Mrs. Muncey’s live (or recently killed) body.

Other evidence confirms that blood did in fact spill from the vials. It appears the vials passed from Dr. Carabia, who performed the autopsy, into the hands of two local law enforcement officers, who transported it to the FBI, where Agent Bigbee performed the enzyme tests. The blood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither preservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were stored in a styrofoam box, but nothing indicates the box was kept cool. Rather, in what an evidence protocol expert at the habeas hearing described as a violation of proper procedure, the styrofoam box was packed in the same cardboard box as other evidence including House’s pants (apparently in a paper bag) and other clothing (in separate bags). The cardboard box was then carried in the officers’ car while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee to the FBI lab. Dr. Blake stated that blood vials in hot conditions (such as a car trunk in the summer) could blow open; and in fact, by the time the blood reached the FBI it had hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the time the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert, roughly a vial and a half were empty, though Agent Bigbee testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood, moreover, had seeped onto one corner of the styrofoam box and onto packing gauze inside the box below the vials.

In addition, although the pants apparently were packaged initially in a paper bag and FBI records suggest they arrived at the FBI in one, the record does not contain the paper bag but does contain a plastic bag with a label listing the pants and Agent Scott’s name—and the plastic bag has blood on it. The blood appears in a forked streak roughly five inches long and two inches wide running down the bag’s outside front. Though testing by House’s expert confirmed the stain was blood, the expert could not determine the blood’s source. Speculations about when and how the blood got there add to the confusion regarding the origins of the stains on House’s pants.

Faced with these indications of, at best, poor evidence control, the State attempted to establish at the habeas hearing that all blood spillage occurred after Agent Bigbee examined the pants. Were that the case, of course, then blood would have been detected on the pants before any spill—which would tend to undermine Dr. Blake’s analysis and support using the bloodstains to infer House’s guilt. In support of this theory the State put on testimony by a blood spatter expert who believed the “majority” of the stains were “transfer stains,” that is, stains resulting from “wip[ing] across the surface of the pants” rather than seeping or spillage. App. 293–294. Regarding the spillage in the styrofoam box, the expert noted that yellow “Tennessee Crime Laboratory” tape running around the box and down all four sides did not line up when the bloodstains on the box’s corner were aligned. The inference was that the FBI received the box from Tennessee authorities, opened it, and resealed it before the spillage occurred. Reinforcing this theory, Agent Bigbee testified that he observed no blood spillage in the styrofoam box and that had he detected such signs of evidence contamination, FBI policy would have required immediate return of the evidence.

In response House argued that even assuming the tape alignment showed spillage occurring after FBI testing, spillage on one or more earlier occasions was likely. In fact even the State’s spatter expert declined to suggest the blood in the box and on the packing gauze accounted for the full vial and a quarter missing. And when the defense expert opened the box and discovered the spills, the bulk of the blood-caked gauze was located around and underneath the half-full vial, which was also located near the stained corner. No gauze immediately surrounding the completely empty vial was stained. The tape, moreover, circled the box in two layers, one underneath the other, and in one spot the underlying layer stops cleanly at the lid’s edge, as if cut with a razor, and does not continue onto the body of the box below. In House’s view this clean cut suggests the double layers could not have resulted simply from wrapping the tape around twice, as the spatter expert claimed; rather, someone possessing Tennessee Crime Lab tape—perhaps the officers transporting the blood and pants—must have cut the box open and resealed it, possibly creating an opportunity for spillage. Supporting the same inference, a label on the box’s lid lists both blood and vaginal secretions as the box’s contents, though Agent Bigbee’s records show the vaginal fluids arrived at the FBI in a separate envelope. Finally, cross-examination revealed that Agent Bigbee’s practice did not always match the letter of FBI policy. Although Mrs. Muncey’s bra and housecoat were packed together in a single bag, creating, according to Agent Bigbee, a risk of “cross contamination,” id., at 286, he did not return them; nor did he note the discrepancy between the “[b]lood and [v]aginal secretions” label and the styrofoam box’s actual contents, though he insisted his customary practice was to match labels with contents immediately upon opening an evidence box. Id., at 287.

The State challenged Dr. Blake’s scientific conclusions, and to do so it called Agent Bigbee as a witness. Agent Bigbee defended the testimony he had given at the trial. To begin with, he suggested Dr. Blake had misconstrued the term “inc” in Agent Bigbee’s trial report, interpreting it to mean “incomplete” when it in fact meant “inconclusive.” Id., at 254–256, 282. Dr. Blake, however, replied “[s]ame difference” when asked whether his opinion would change if “inc” meant “inconclusive.” Id., at 256; see also 6 Tr. 906 (Bigbee trial testimony) (“You will notice I have INC written under the transparent, that is the symbol that I use to mean the test was incomplete”). Agent Bigbee further asserted that, whereas Dr. Blake (in Bigbee’s view) construed the results to mean the enzyme was not present at all, in fact the results indicated only that Bigbee could not identify the marker type on whatever enzymes were present. App. 282. Yet the State did not cross-examine Dr. Blake on this point, nor did the District Court resolve the dispute one way or the other, so on this record it seems possible that Dr. Blake meant only to suggest the blood was too degraded to permit conclusive typing. The State, moreover, does not ask us to question Dr. Blake’s basic premise about the durability of blood chemicals deposited on cotton—a premise Agent Bigbee appeared to accept as a general matter. Given the record as it stands, then, we cannot say Dr. Blake’s conclusions have been discredited; if other objections might be adduced, they must await further proceedings. At the least, the record before us contains credible testimony suggesting that the missing enzyme markers are generally better preserved on cloth than in poorly kept test tubes, and that principle could support House’s spillage theory for the blood’s origin.

In this Court, as a further attack on House’s showing, the State suggests that, given the spatter expert’s testimony, House’s theory would require a jury to surmise that Tennessee officials donned the pants and deliberately spread blood over them. We disagree. This should be a matter for the trier of fact to consider in the first instance, but we can note a line of argument that could refute the State’s position. It is correct that the State’s spatter expert opined that the stains resulted from wiping or smearing rather than direct spillage; and she further stated that the distribution of stains in some spots suggests the pants were “folded in some manner or creased in some manner” when the transfers occurred, id., at 296. While the expert described this pattern, at least with respect to stains on the lap of the pants, as “consistent” with the pants being worn at the time of the staining, ibid., her testimony, as we understand it, does not refute the hypothesis that the packaging of the pants for transport was what caused them to be folded or creased. It seems permissible, moreover, to conclude that the small size and wide distribution of stains—inside the right pocket, outside that pocket, near the inside button, on the left thigh and outside leg, on the seat of the pants, and on the right bottom cuff, including inside the pants—fits as well with spillage in transport as with wiping and smearing from bloody objects at the crime scene, as the State proposes. (As has been noted, no blood was found on House’s shoes.)

The District Court discounted Dr. Blake’s opinion, not on account of Blake’s substantive approach, but based on testimony from Agent Scott indicating he saw, as the District Court put it, “what appeared to be bloodstains on Mr. House’s blue jeans when the jeans were removed from the laundry hamper at Ms. Turner’s trailer.” Id., at 348. This inference seems at least open to question, however. Agent Scott stated only that he “saw reddish brownish stains [he] suspected to be blood”; he admitted that he “didn’t thoroughly examine the blue jeans at that time.” R276:113–114. The pants were in fact extensively soiled with mud and reddish stains, only small portions of which are blood.

In sum, considering “ ‘all the evidence,’ ” Schlup, 513 U. S., at 328 (quoting Friendly, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev., at 160), on this issue, we think the evidentiary disarray surrounding the blood, taken together with Dr. Blake’s testimony and the limited rebuttal of it in the present record, would prevent reasonable jurors from placing significant reliance on the blood evidence. We now know, though the trial jury did not, that an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner believes the blood on House’s jeans must have come from autopsy samples; that a vial and a quarter of autopsy blood is unaccounted for; that the blood was transported to the FBI together with the pants in conditions that could have caused vials to spill; that the blood did indeed spill at least once during its journey from Tennessee authorities through FBI hands to a defense expert; that the pants were stored in a plastic bag bearing both a large blood stain and a label with TBI Agent Scott’s name; and that the styrofoam box containing the blood samples may well have been opened before it arrived at the FBI lab. Thus, whereas the bloodstains, emphasized by the prosecution, seemed strong evidence of House’s guilt at trial, the record now raises substantial questions about the blood’s origin.

A Different Suspect

Were House’s challenge to the State’s case limited to the questions he has raised about the blood and semen, the other evidence favoring the prosecution might well suffice to bar relief. There is, however, more; for in the post-trial proceedings House presented troubling evidence that Mr. Muncey, the victim’s husband, himself could have been the murderer.

At trial, as has been noted, the jury heard that roughly two weeks before the murder Mrs. Muncey’s brother received a frightened phone call from his sister indicating that she and Mr. Muncey had been fighting, that she was scared, and that she wanted to leave him. The jury also learned that the brother once saw Mr. Muncey “smac[k]” the victim. 7 Tr. 1087–1088. House now has produced evidence from multiple sources suggesting that Mr. Muncey regularly abused his wife. For example, one witness—Kathy Parker, a lifelong area resident who denied any animosity towards Mr. Muncey—recalled that Mrs. Muncey “was constantly with black eyes and busted mouth.” App. 235. In addition Hazel Miller, who is Kathy Parker’s mother and a lifelong acquaintance of Mr. Muncey, testified at the habeas hearing that two or three months before the victim’s death Mr. Muncey came to Miller’s home and “tried to get my daughter [Parker] to go out with him,” R274:47. (Parker had dated Mr. Muncey at age 14.) According to Miller, Muncey said “[h]e was upset with his wife, that they had had an argument and he said he was going to get rid of that woman one way or the other.” App. 236.

Another witness—Mary Atkins, also an area native who “grew up” with Mr. Muncey and professed no hard feelings, R274:10, 16—claims she saw Mr. Muncey “backhan[d]” Mrs. Muncey on the very night of the murder. App. 226, 228. Atkins recalled that during a break in the recreation center dance, she saw Mr. Muncey and his wife arguing in the parking lot. Mr. Muncey “grabbed her and he just backhanded her.” Id., at 228. After that, Mrs. Muncey “left walking.” Id., at 229. There was also testimony from Atkins’ mother, named Artie Lawson. A self-described “good friend” of Mr. Muncey, id., at 231, Lawson said Mr. Muncey visited her the morning after the murder, before the body was found. According to Lawson, Mr. Muncey asked her to tell anyone who inquired not only that she had been at the dance the evening before and had seen him, but also that he had breakfasted at her home at 6 o’clock that morning. Lawson had not in fact been at the dance, nor had Mr. Muncey been with her so early.

Of most importance is the testimony of Kathy Parker and her sister Penny Letner. They testified at the habeas hearing that, around the time of House’s trial, Mr. Muncey had confessed to the crime. Parker recalled that she and “some family members and some friends [were] sitting around drinking” at Parker’s trailer when Mr. Muncey “just walked in and sit down.” R274:37. Muncey, who had evidently been drinking heavily, began “rambling off … [t]alking about what happened to his wife and how it happened and he didn’t mean to do it.” Ibid. According to Parker, Mr. Muncey “said they had been into [an] argument and he slapped her and she fell and hit her head and it killed her and he didn’t mean for it to happen.” Id., at 38. Parker said she “freaked out and run him off.” Ibid.

Letner similarly recalled that at some point either “during [House’s] trial or just before,” id., at 30, Mr. Muncey intruded on a gathering at Parker’s home. Appearing “pretty well blistered,” Muncey “went to crying and was talking about his wife and her death and he was saying that he didn’t mean to do it.” App. 232. “[D]idn’t mean to do what[?],” Letner asked, R274:33, at which point Mr. Muncey explained:

“[S]he was ‘bitching him out’ because he didn’t take her fishing that night, that he went to the dance instead. He said when he come home that she was still on him pretty heavily ‘bitching him out’ again and that he smacked her and that she fell and hit her head. He said I didn’t mean to do it, but I had to get rid of her, because I didn’t want to be charged with murder.” App. 232–233.

Letner, who was then 19 years old with a small child, said Mr. Muncey’s statement “scared [her] quite badly,” so she “got out of there immediately.” Id., at 233. Asked whether she reported the incident to the authorities, Letner stated, “I was frightened, you know… . I figured me being 19 year old they wouldn’t listen to anything I had to say.” R274:31. Parker, on the other hand, claimed she (Parker) in fact went to the Sherriff’s Department, but no one would listen:

“I tried to speak to the Sheriff but he was real busy. He sent me to a deputy. The deputy told me to go upstairs to the courtroom and talk to this guy, I can’t remember his name. I never did really get to talk to anybody.” App. 234.

Parker said she did not discuss the matter further because “[t]hey had it all signed, sealed and delivered. We didn’t know anything to do until we heard that they reopened [House’s] trial.” R274:45. Parker’s mother, Hazel Miller, confirmed she had driven Parker to the courthouse, where Parker “went to talk to some of the people about this case.” App. 237.

Other testimony suggests Mr. Muncey had the opportunity to commit the crime. According to Dennis Wallace, a local law enforcement official who provided security at the dance on the night of the murder, Mr. Muncey left the dance “around 10:00, 10:30, 9:30 to 10:30.” R274:56–57. Although Mr. Muncey told law enforcement officials just after the murder that he left the dance only briefly and returned, Wallace could not recall seeing him back there again. Later that evening, Wallace responded to Mr. Muncey’s report that his wife was missing. Muncey denied he and his wife had been “a fussing or a fighting”; he claimed his wife had been “kidnapped.” Id., at 58. Wallace did not recall seeing any blood, disarray, or knocked-over furniture, although he admitted he “didn’t pay too much attention” to whether the floor appeared especially clean. According to Wallace, Mr. Muncey said “let’s search for her” and then led Wallace out to search “in the weeds” around the home and the driveway (not out on the road where the body was found). Id., at 58, 60, 63.

In the habeas proceedings, then, two different witnesses (Parker and Letner) described a confession by Mr. Muncey; two more (Atkins and Lawson) described suspicious behavior (a fight and an attempt to construct a false alibi) around the time of the crime; and still other witnesses described a history of abuse.

As to Parker and Letner, the District Court noted that it was “not impressed with the allegations of individuals who wait over ten years to come forward with their evidence,” especially considering that “there was no physical evidence in the Munceys’ kitchen to corroborate [Mr. Muncey’s] alleged confession that he killed [his wife] there.” App. 348. Parker and Letner, however, did attempt to explain their delay coming forward, and the record indicates no reason why these two women, both lifelong acquaintances of Mr. Muncey, would have wanted either to frame him or to help House. Furthermore, the record includes at least some independent support for the statements Parker and Letner attributed to Mr. Muncey. The supposed explanation for the fatal fight—that his wife was complaining about going fishing—fits with Mrs. Muncey’s statement to Luttrell earlier that evening that her husband’s absence was “all right, because she was going to make him take her fishing the next day,” id., at 11–12. And Dr. Blake testified, in only partial contradiction of Dr. Carabia, that Mrs. Muncey’s head injury resulted from “a surface with an edge” or “a hard surface with a corner,” not from a fist. R275:72. (Dr. Carabia had said either a fist or some other object could have been the cause.)

Mr. Muncey testified at the habeas hearing, and the District Court did not question his credibility. Though Mr. Muncey said he seemed to remember visiting Lawson the day after the murder, he denied either killing his wife or confessing to doing so. Yet Mr. Muncey also claimed, contrary to Constable Wallace’s testimony and to his own prior statement, that he left the dance on the night of the crime only when it ended at midnight. Mr. Muncey, moreover, denied ever hitting Mrs. Muncey; the State itself had to impeach him with a prior statement on this point.

It bears emphasis, finally, that Parker’s and Letner’s testimony is not comparable to the sort of eleventh-hour affidavit vouching for a defendant and incriminating a conveniently absent suspect that Justice O’Connor described in her concurring opinion in Herrera as “unfortunate” and “not uncommon” in capital cases, 506 U. S., at 423; nor was the confession Parker and Letner described induced under pressure of interrogation. The confession evidence here involves an alleged spontaneous statement recounted by two eyewitnesses with no evident motive to lie. For this reason it has more probative value than, for example, incriminating testimony from inmates, suspects, or friends or relations of the accused.

The evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey is by no means conclusive. If considered in isolation, a reasonable jury might well disregard it. In combination, however, with the challenges to the blood evidence and the lack of motive with respect to House, the evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey likely would reinforce other doubts as to House’s guilt.

Other Evidence

Certain other details were presented at the habeas hearing. First, Dr. Blake, in addition to testifying about the blood evidence and the victim’s head injury, examined photographs of House’s bruises and scratches and concluded, based on 35 years’ experience monitoring the development and healing of bruises, that they were too old to have resulted from the crime. In addition Dr. Blake claimed that the injury on House’s right knuckle was indicative of “[g]etting mashed”; it was not consistent with striking someone. R275:63. (That of course would also eliminate the explanation that the injury came from the blow House supposedly told Turner he gave to his unidentified assailant.)

The victim’s daughter, Lora Muncey (now Lora Tharp), also testified at the habeas hearing. She repeated her recollection of hearing a man with a deep voice like her grandfather’s and a statement that her father had had a wreck down by the creek. She also denied seeing any signs of struggle or hearing a fight between her parents, though she also said she could not recall her parents ever fighting physically. The District Court found her credible, and this testimony certainly cuts in favor of the State.

Finally, House himself testified at the habeas proceedings. He essentially repeated the story he allegedly told Turner about getting attacked on the road. The District Court found, however, based on House’s demeanor, that he “was not a credible witness.” App. 329.

Conclusion

This is not a case of conclusive exoneration. Some aspects of the State’s evidence—Lora Muncey’s memory of a deep voice, House’s bizarre evening walk, his lie to law enforcement, his appearance near the body, and the blood on his pants—still support an inference of guilt. Yet the central forensic proof connecting House to the crime—the blood and the semen—has been called into question, and House has put forward substantial evidence pointing to a different suspect. Accordingly, and although the issue is close, we conclude that this is the rare case where—had the jury heard all the conflicting testimony—it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror viewing the record as a whole would lack reasonable doubt.

V

In addition to his gateway claim under Schlup, House argues that he has shown freestanding innocence and that as a result his imprisonment and planned execution are unconstitutional. In Herrera, decided three years before Schlup, the Court assumed without deciding that “in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of ‘actual innocence’ made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenue open to process such a claim.” 506 U. S., at 417; see also id., at 419 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“I cannot disagree with the fundamental legal principle that executing the innocent is inconsistent with the Constitution”). “[T]he threshold showing for such an assumed right would necessarily be extraordinarily high,” the Court explained, and petitioner’s evidence there fell “far short of that which would have to be made in order to trigger the sort of constitutional claim which we have assumed, arguendo, to exist.” Id., at 417, 418–419; see also id., at 427 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (noting that because “[p]etitioner has failed to make a persuasive showing of actual innocence,” “the Court has no reason to pass on, and appropriately reserves, the question whether federal courts may entertain convincing claims of actual innocence”). House urges the Court to answer the question left open in Herrera and hold not only that freestanding innocence claims are possible but also that he has established one.

We decline to resolve this issue. We conclude here, much as in Herrera, that whatever burden a hypothetical freestanding innocence claim would require, this petitioner has not satisfied it. To be sure, House has cast considerable doubt on his guilt—doubt sufficient to satisfy Schlup’s gateway standard for obtaining federal review despite a state procedural default. In Herrera, however, the Court described the threshold for any hypothetical freestanding innocence claim as “extraordinarily high.” 506 U. S., at 417. The sequence of the Court’s decisions in Herrera and Schlup—first leaving unresolved the status of freestanding claims and then establishing the gateway standard—implies at the least that Herrera requires more convincing proof of innocence than Schlup. It follows, given the closeness of the Schlup question here, that House’s showing falls short of the threshold implied in Herrera.

*  *  *

House has satisfied the gateway standard set forth in Schlup and may proceed on remand with procedurally defaulted constitutional claims. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life"

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 1]
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Bridge]
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries"

Stolen DanceMilky Chance,"[Verse 1]
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind
But now they’ve brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

[Chorus]
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor

So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night

Yellow Flicker BeatLorde,"[Produced by Paul Epworth]
[Written by Lorde and Joel Little]

[Verse 1]
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, I’m quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I’m done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Verse 2]
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I’m done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Outro]
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat"

From up above I heard
The angels sing to me these words
And sometimes, in your eyes
I see the beauty in the world

[Chorus]
Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and she lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
Eyes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the stars decide
To reflect in puddles in the dirt
When I look in your eyes
I forget all about what hurts

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry

The Kids Aren't AlrightFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

[Verse 2]
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

[Bridge]
Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright"

Something From NothingFoo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
Give me the flammable life
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
So here I go
Here lies a city on fire
Singing along, the arsonist choir
Now here I go
It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now, here I go
There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now, here I go, well

[Bridge]
Oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way
But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go, well
Oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
You had no choice you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
You took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

[Chorus]
But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now ain't that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
It goes oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It goes oh, oh, oh

No you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now wait that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

Did you stand there all alone?

I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
Do do do do do do

[Chorus 2]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

The Blower's DaughterMatt McAndrew,"And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me

The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes

And so it is
The colder water

The pupil in denial

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes

Did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind?

Lampshades On FireModest Mouse,"We're all going, we're all going

Well, the lampshade's on fire when the lights go out
The room lit up and we ran about
Well, this is what I really call a party now
Packed up our cars, move to the next town

Well, the lampshade's on fire when the lights go out
This is what I really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
This one's done so where to now?

Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
Shaved off my eyebrows, let 'em fall to the ground
So I can't look surprised right now

Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Burn it up or just chop it down
But this one's done so where to now?

Buh buh buh buh buh buh ba-da-dah

But this one's done so where to now?

Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
The room lights up, well, we're still dancing around
We're having fun, having some fun now

Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Open one up and let it fall to the ground
Pile out the door when it all runs out

We're all going, we're all going

We have spines and other bones
We'll eat your food, we'll throw stones
Well, this is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go

Well, we're the human race
We're going to party at this place
And then move on
(Tough luck)

We'll kill you off and then make a clone
Yeah, we got spines, yeah, we have bones
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go

As our feelings are getting hurt
Oh, we want you to do the work
Our ass looks great inside these jeans
Well, we want just our water clean

This is how it's always been
And this is how it's going to be
So you just move on

The air's on fire so we're moving on
Better find another one cause this one's done
Waiting for the magic of the scientist's glove
To push, push, push, push, pull us up

Spend some time, float in outer space
Find another planet, make the same mistakes
Our mind's all shattered when we climb aboard
Hoping for the scientists to find another door"
ReflectionsMisterWives,"[Verse 1]
You didn't close the door
Left a crack open, I couldn't ignore
The faint possibility
Of having hope in this insanity
That we still could be
But we're stuck floating in between

[Chorus]
Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you

[Verse 2]
Our eyes were closed with hearts open wide
Dismissed every rule to abide by
Our bodies undressed the layers of shy
Revealing the truth that was buried inside
Filled up of feelings
That now are bursting at the seams

[Chorus]
Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you

[Bridge]
Unsure of what are my dreams, it seems
You've stolen my slumber and awakened another
Life within me that is better than any other
Reaching endless heights in never-ending nights
That can't be seen, put to bed this dream
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you"
Wrong Side Of HeavenFive Finger Death Punch,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I spoke to God today
And she said that she's ashamed
What have I become?
What have I done?
I spoke to the devil today
And he swears he's not to blame
And I understood
'Cause I feel the same

[Chorus]
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side... the righteous side of Hell

[Verse 2]
I heard from God today
And she sounded just like me
What have I done
And who have I become
I saw the devil today
And he looked a lot like me
I looked away
I turned away

[Chorus]
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell

And the righteous side... the righteous side of Hell

I'm not defending
Downward descending
Falling further and further away
Getting closer every day
I'm getting closer every day
To the end
To the end, the end, the end
I'm getting...) closer every day

[Chorus]
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
(I’m on)The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell

[Outro]
(I’m on)The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side... the righteous side of Hell"

Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?

Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No ""Who cares?"", no vacant stare
No time for me

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

[Verse 2]
Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?

Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
To hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword

Work SongHozier,"[Verse 1]
Boys, workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat

There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Verse 2]
Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib

And I was burning up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Bridge]
My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me

When I was kissin' on my baby
And she'd put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamp light, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her"

WarriorsImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away

That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

Above the rest and prove yourself

I Am MachineThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
Here's to bein' human
All the pain and sufferin'
There's beauty in the bleedin'
At least you feel somethin'
I wish I knew what it was like
To care enough to carry on
I wish I knew what it was like
To find a place where I belong

[Chorus]
But I am machine, I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'
I am machine, I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken

Wishes I could just feel somethin'

Here's to bein' human
Takin' it for granted
The highs and lows of livin'

Find a place where I belong

Come Join The MurderThe White Buffalo,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a black bird perched outside my window
I hear him calling
I hear him sing
He burns me with his eyes of gold to embers
He sees all my sins
He reads my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
One day that bird, he spoke to me
Like Martin Luther
Like Pericles

[Chorus]
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human trap
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king

On a blanket made of woven shadows
Flew up to heaven
On a raven's glide
These angels have turned my wings to wax now
I fell like Judas grace denied

On that day that he lied to me
Like Martin Luther
Like Pericles

Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human trap

Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king

I walk among the children of my fathers
The broken wings, betrayal's cost
They call to me but never touch my heart, no
I am too far
I'm too lost

All I can hear is what he spoke to me
Like Martin Luther
Like Pericles

Come join the murder

So now I curse that raven's fire
You made me hate, you made me burn

Come join the murder
Come fly with black

Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human trap
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings

DrownBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growin' deeper an' deeper
And I can't take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is hauntin' me
An' the weight of the world's gettin' harder to hold up

If beauty is on the inside
Why do they hand us mirrors?
If perfection is impossible
Then why is weakness feared?

[Chorus]
I wanna be somebody not based on who the world says I should be
'Cause in those eyes, I'm not good enough, good enough
I've heard a million voices, there's only one that I believe
And in those eyes, I am good enough, good enough

And I've tried to fit their image
Imagine all the time I waste
Trying to paint this perfect picture of myself

Like Real People DoHozier,"[Verse 1]
I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?

I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

Angel Of Small Death And The Codeine SceneHozier,"[Verse 1]
I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths

Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Verse 2]
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene"

Then pray for the sun to come again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never thought I could feel so small
But you're the one that can't live without attention
I never thought I would lose this all
But you're the one who needs the fucking intervention

[Chorus]
Now I'm reliving my whole damn life
And it's a shame that I can't remember
And now I'm living the same damn lie
And it's a shame, but nothing's forever

[Verse 2]
With every new regret I start to wear down
Then pray for the pain to go away
I need an amulet, I need a new sound
I know everything remains the same

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I never thought I could feel so small
I'm the one who will suffer this detention
I never thought I would lose this all
But I accept this is my new education

[Chorus]
Now I'm reliving my whole damn life
And it's a shame that I can't remember
And now I'm living the same damn lie
And it's a shame, but nothing's forever
Now I'm reliving my whole damn life
And it's a shame that I can't remember
And now I'm living the same damn lie
And it's a shame, but nothing's forever

[Break for Guitar riff]

[Chorus]
Now I'm reliving my whole damn life
And it's a shame that I can't remember
And now I'm living the same damn lie
And it's a shame, but nothing's forever
Now I'm reliving my whole damn life
And it's a shame that I can't remember
And now I'm living the same damn lie
And it's a shame, but nothing's forever

They keep calling
But there's no answer
Cuz it's the weekend

Working class to the bone
And I know you're tired of hearing it

This right here is the D.O. proletariat
It's the weekend
Come on the weekend

Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started

Rest when we're old
Should do as we're told
But I just can't help it
I'll reach for the stove
The night closes in
Now for the second act
Tell our friends go ahead
Cause we're hanging back
Youth like a spark
It lights up the dark
We unlock the mystery
I knew that you'd miss me
My mouth on your neck
Your touch on my cheek
Let hands guide the way
As we play hide and seek

[Bridge]
Oh baby please stay true
What you gonna do when I come for you uh oh
Oh baby please stay true
What you gonna do
My arrows shoot for you
My arrow shoots so true
These arrows shoot for you
My arrow shoots so true

Hell yeah I just got paid

Fools GoldFitz And The Tantrums,"[Intro]
Oh maybe I just wasn't good enough
To blow your mind
You know I tried
Them silver lines, they cut like blades of glass
Not worth the blood we've shed for love

[Pre Chorus]
So give it up
Stop beating
Hearts have gone cold
Had enough repeating
It's all been done before
Give it up
Start heating
Hearts have gone cold
Hey now
When we gonna wake up

[Chorus]
But fool's gold shines like diamonds in her eyes
Thought we had a million
But baby we got nothing
But fool's gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging
Find us something better for the next time
Next time
Something better for the next time/next time

[Verse 2]
So maybe I was just not strong enough
To tow the lines
Make truth the lies
The fortune made now it's all locked away
We lost the key
How to believe

[Pre-Chorus]
So give it up
Start heating
Hearts have gone cold
Had enough bleed
Bleeding
It's all been done before
Give it up
Start heating
Hearts have gone cold
Hey now
When we gonna wake up

But fool's gold shines like diamonds in her eyes
Thought we had a million
But baby we got nothing
But fool's gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging
Find us something better for the next time
Next time
Something better for the next time/next time

Oh baby I just wasn't good enough
Maybe I wasn't strong enough

Jackie And WilsonHozier,"[Verse 1]
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

[Verse 2]
She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And lord, she found me just in time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Verse 3]
Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues"
Every Other Frecklealt-J,"[Verse 1]
I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
(Do, do, do-do-do-do-do)
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet

[Verse 2]
You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole!)
I want to be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
Gonna paw, paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woollen jumper

Oh...Devour me
Oh...Lou, Lou, let the cover girls sing!

All handclaps, you will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room!)
I want to be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you

I'm gonna kiss you
Like the sun browns you

Oh...If you really think that you can stomach me

Kansas CityThe New Basement Tapes,"I listen to you time and time again
While you tell me just what’s right
And you tell me a thousand things a day
Then sleep somewhere’s else at night
I’m going back to Kansas City

And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
I’m going back to Kansas City

And you call me to come, then I do
And you say you made some mistake
You invite me into your house
Then you say you gotta pay for what you break
I’m going back to Kansas City

And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
I’m going back to Kansas City

Gypsy woman, you know every place I go
Even a thousand miles away from home
You don’t care if I’m asleep or I’m awake
This fickle heart just turn to stone
I’m going back to Kansas City

And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
I’m going back to Kansas City

And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
And I love you dear, but just how long
Can I keep singing the same old song
I’m going back to Kansas City"
Cherry WineHozier,"[Verse 1]
Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh, but she burns
Like rum on the fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me

[Chorus]
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Verse 2]
Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

[Chorus 2]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Verse 3]
Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh, but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

[Chorus 2]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine"
"God, If You Are Above...Falling In Reverse","[Verse 1]
God cannot save my soul, it's straight to hell for me, I know
And when I get there, at least I found a place to call my home
But they say the truth will set you free, then why am I still here?
I've got no truth left, don't you see? Am I making myself clear?

[Pre-Chorus]
Resolution, no solution

[Chorus]
God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?

[Verse 2]
The spirit's stuck between two roads and waiting there on me
The first path is the way to go, the life I wanna lead
The second road's my crazy past, the darkest parts I try to mask
The drugs, the guns, the lies, the love, the dreams I had of waking up

[Pre-Chorus]
Resolution, no solution

[Chorus]
God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?

[Bridge]
Don't tell me I'm not worth the time
I will be fine
All these prayers have gone unanswered
Where were you? Where were you?

[Chorus]
God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?
God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?"
Something DifferentGodsmack,"[Chorus]
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Something black, something light, something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
Something black, something light, something different
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?

[Verse 1]
All this noise in my head
Ringing through and echoing
Simple things just take too long, long, long
It's not like I'm not listening
But you just keep on flipping it
And maybe one day I'll be gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Something black, something light, something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
Something black, something light, something different
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
To me that way

[Verse 2]
Try to leave the past behind me
But you just keep reminding me
And threw it in my face so wrong, wrong, wrong
I try to see things your way
But something changes every day
And every question way too long, long, long

[Chorus]
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Something black, something light, something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
Something black, something light, something different
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
To me that way
To me that way

[Bridge]
I've been missing yesterday
Taking me so far away from where I've been gone, yeah
Making me someone I've never known

[Chorus]
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Something black, something light, something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
Something black, something light, something different
Something wrong, something right, something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
To me that way
To me that way"
Flashed Junk MindMilky Chance,"[Bridge]
When we were young souls
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine
I feel your heartbeat
All the time

[Chorus]
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

And we were young souls

Someone NewHozier,"[Verse 1]
Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

[Verse 2]
There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

The Only Way OutBush,"[Verse 1:]
Follow me down to the water
Through the trip wires in your head
Through the seven layers
Of your holy bed
Where there is no one God
But a series of systems
I wanna be your savior
I wanna be your seasons

The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you
The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you

Follow me down to the freeway
Where the beat goes on
And a heatwave blast the night
Say what you will but we pray
To the God's of our own demise
All the time

We'll stay warm in the night time
Warm in the night time

Fourth Of JulyFall Out Boy,"[Intro]
You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire

[Chorus]
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Verse 1]
I'll be as honest as you'll let me
I miss your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite what if
You are my best I'll never know
And I'm starting to forget
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

[Chorus]
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Verse 2]
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Bridge]
I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July"
Blank SpaceI Prevail,"[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

Hey, hey

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the good girls bad for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your... name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the Queen, baby, I'm your King
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
But, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is he? Who is he?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name...

[Bridge]
Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far

Jet Pack BluesFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy, the kind that makes June
Feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent

[Pre-Chorus]
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

[Chorus]
And I remember, ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) Did you ever love her? Do you know?
(I remember) Or did you never want to be alone?
(I remember) And she was singing, ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""

[Verse 2]
I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight
And just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our heads were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

[Chorus]
And I remember, ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) Did you ever love her? Do you know?
(I remember) Or did you never want to be alone?
(I remember) And she was singing, ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""

[Pre-Chorus]
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

[Chorus]
And I remember, ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) Did you ever love her? Do you know?

First KissKid Rock,"[Verse 1]
I remember waiting for the school bus
Jenny Clayton was my first crush
And neither one of us had a clue
An old Cheyenne it was my first truck
Rusted, rough and kinda beat up
But when she jumped in it felt brand new

[Pre-Hook]
And now these days when I drive through a small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

Just to love you again

[Verse 2]
I remember drinking from the same cup
We’d break up just to make up
I remember falling in love with you
Smokin’ cigarettes on the tailgate
Man it seems like it was yesterday
When Main Street felt like Park Avenue

[Pre-Hook 2]
And when I’m driving through any ol’ small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those times that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

[Bridge]
When forever felt like it would never come
And we never thought we’d turn 21
So young we thought this could never end
Oh how I wish we could go back again

[Verse 3]
And now that time has taken over
And we can’t fight this getting older
But somehow baby we made it through
And every time I’m a lookin’ at you

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

[Outro]
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time"
NovocaineFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
This is a black, black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch

[Pre-Chorus]
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

[Chorus]
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you

[Verse 2]
I’m just a problem that doesn't want to be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream

[Pre- Chorus]
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

[Chorus]
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you

[Bridge]
Ooooh, I say one day the valley's gonna swallow me whole
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)
I feel like a photo that’s been overexposed
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)

[Chorus]
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you"
Twin's Skeleton's (Hotel In NYC)Fall Out Boy,"[Chorus]
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Verse 1]
I just need enough of you to dull the pain
Just to get me through the night 'till we're twins again
'Til we're stripped down to our skeletons again
'Til we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble 'til you find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you, you shrug that

[Chorus]
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
A birth and a death on the same day
And, honey, I only appeared so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck
But I can string enough to show my face in the light again

[Chorus]
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Outro]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on"
Favorite RecordFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
Do you, do-do you remember
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night
And we danced, we danced to Rancid
And we danced, we danced
And I confessed, confessed
To you riding shot-gun
Underneath the purple skies
And we danced, we danced
With windows down
And we danced, we danced

All Bad ThingsMotley Crue,"""That's one thing you'll never get out of us; we'll never water ourselves down
I mean, we'd rather just break up than be bland.""


You saw this coming like a freight train
You mother-fuckers saw the writing on the wall
We were the bottom of the food chain
We never said we loved each other after all

Lethal injections and electric chairs
A thousand ways to die
We don't care
We're just here for our crucifixion

All bad things must end, all bad things must die
Even the devil's gotta pay for his crime
Aa-aa-aa-aa-ah, aa-aa-aa-aa-ah
All bad things must end, all bad things must die

Even the angels wanna cry
Cause all bad things must die

So here we are, beat up and bloody
We fought each other from the gutter to the top
Not sentimental in the least way
Let's pull the plug on this before it starts to rot

Execution by a hangman's noose
A thousand ways to die, you can choose
We're just here for our crucifixion

All bad things must end, all bad things must die
Even the devil's gotta pay for his crime
Aa-aa-aa-aa-ah, aa-aa-aa-aa-ah
All bad things must end, all bad things must die

It's been one hell of a ride, it's been one hell of a night
It's been a damn good life, this ain't farewell, it's goodbye
It's been a hell of a ride

All bad things
We don't care
All bad things

All bad things must end, all bad things must die
Even the devil's gotta pay for his crime
Aa-aa-aa-aa-ah, aa-aa-aa-aa-ah
All bad things must end, all bad things must die

It's been one hell of a ride, it's been one hell of a night
It's been a damn good life, this ain't farewell, it's goodbye
It's been one hell of a ride, it's been one hell of a night
It's been a damn good life, this ain't farewell, it's goodbye
It's been a hell of a ride

All bad things must die"
Something's Gotta GiveAll Time Low,"[Verse 1]
I woke up in a stranger's bed
With pins and needles in my head
And the clock ticking off the wall
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I don't even know myself
I wish I could be someone else
But I don't have a clue at all
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sinking, you're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Oh, Wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Oh, pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm a fucking waste
Filling up the empty space
I've been here way too long
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm feeling like a nervous wreck
Living on the last paycheck
I'm the cliche in a song
And everybody's singing along

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sinking, you're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Oh, Wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give

Someone please come pull me out
From the shadow of my doubt
Wake me up, I'm falling

Pull me out of this sinking town

Make You BetterThe Decemberists,"[Verse 1]
I want you, thin fingers
I wanted you, thin fingernails
And when you bend backwards
I wanted you, I needed you
Oh-oh, to make me better

[Verse 2]
I'll love you in springtime
I lost you when summer came
And when you pulled backwards
I wanted to, I needed to
Oh-oh, to make me better
Oh-oh, to make me better

[Chorus]
But we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around to make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day you met her
But it'd make you better
It'd make you better

I sung you your twinges
I suffered you your tattletales
And when you broke sideways
I wanted you, I needed you
Oh-oh, to make me better
Oh-oh, to make me better

But we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around and make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day that you met her
And it'd make you better
Did it make you better?
Make you better, oh

[Bridge]
And all I wanted was a sliver to call mine
And all I wanted was a shimmer in your shine
To make me bright

[Chorus]
Cause we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around and make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day you met her
But it'd make you better
It'd make you better, oh"
Face Everything And RisePapa Roach,"[Intro]
Face everything and rise
Face everything and rise

The streets crawl with a deadly omen
Outside I see a world that's broken
I can't breathe, my heart is choking
I need a cure for this life I've chosen

My pain is a blessing in disguise
I feel it cutting and it's cutting like a knife
My pain, my pain is a blessing in disguise
I feel it cutting and it's cutting like a knife

Angels keep falling from the sky
I'll take your broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise

But it feels like the tide is turning
Love hurts and there's no warning
Lightning strikes, my heart is storming

The flood's coming and it's drowning all the lies
The pain, the rain is a blessing in disguise
The flood's coming and it's drowning all the lies

Never gonna quit until I die
Angels keep falling from the sky

Throw me in the fire, I'll never be the same

I'm under fire when I'm burning wide awake
My life feels empty when I am walking through the flames
W-w-w-walking through the flames
W-w-w-walking through the flames

[Chorus]
I will face everything and rise
Never gonna quit until I die
Angels keep falling from the sky
I'll take your broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise
The pain, the pain is a blessing in disguise
Face everything and rise
The pain, the pain is a blessing in disguise
Face everything and rise"
Moving OnAsking Alexandria,"[Verse 1]
A boy of anguish, now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road
The years were cruel to him, no he won't let them go
Lays awake tryina find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world

[Chorus]
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

[Verse 2]
He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside
His red eyes tearing up at the man that he'd became
Slowly but surely on the fast track to falling into his grave

[Chorus]
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

[Bridge]
I can't believe I've come so far in such short time
And I'm still fighting on my own
If I stop to catch my breath I might never breathe again
So just know this
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I can't believe I let myself break down

[Chorus]
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

Cecilia And The SatelliteAndrew McMahon In The Wilderness,"[Verse 1]
I locked myself in a hotel room
Then waited all night for the walls to move
I've loved some girls that I barely knew
I've made some friends, and I've lost some too
Crashed my car, I was seventeen
My mother in the seat riding next to me
The things I've learned from a broken mirror
How a face can change when a heart knows fear

[Pre-Chorus 1]
For all the things my eyes have seen
The best by far is you

[Chorus]
If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry
Don't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Verse 2]
Cafe crawling through Amsterdam
Been around the world with a punk rock band
And I've seen London, and I played Japan
I've been knocked down, I got up again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
For all the places I have been
I'm no place without you

[Chorus]
If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry
Don't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

For all the things my hands have held
The best by far is you

Every Breaking WaveU2,"[Verse 1]
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
Every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearlessness
Now, I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 2]
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
Every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
It's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Bridge]
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?"
What Kind Of ManFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
I was on a heavy tip
Trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side, like always
Wondering what to do with life

[Verse 2]
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

[Verse 3]
To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

[Verse 4]
You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
To have me crawling back for more

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
For twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

But I can't beat ya, 'cause I'm still with ya
""Oh mercy"", I implore
""Oh mercy"", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall

What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

What kind of man loves like this?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?"

Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you?
Somehow, somehow?

[Chorus]
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

[Post-Chorus]
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

One Last NightVaults,"[Verse 1]
Tied to a sallow heart
Why does he want to bring me where he goes?
Oh and to find out the reasons why
It's enough to make you wanna try for one last night

[Verse 2]
Ghosts and silhouettes
They take a piece of me, they want it all
Oh but to wait in an empty room
With the feeling that it's closing in

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was dying
But I found nobody there
And if one last night is all that we've been given
Let's live it like we care
For one last night
For one last night

[Verse 3]
Broken upon the rocks
Let the beating waves come drag me down
Oh but to find out the reasons why
It's enough to make you wanna try for one last night

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was dying
But I found nobody there
And if one last night is all that we've been given
Let's live it like we care
For one last night
For one last night

For one last night"

DreamImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

[Chorus]
We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

[Post-Chorus]
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

[Verse 2]
In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess

I'm On FireAWOLNATION,"Hey little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Ooh Ooh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
Can he do to you the things that I can't do?
I can, I can take you higher
Ooh Ooh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six inch valley through the middle of my soul

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire

Black SunDeath Cab For Cutie,"[Verse 1]:
There is whiskey in the water
And there is death upon the vine
There is fear in the eyes of your father
And there is ""yours"" and there is ""mine""

There is a desert veiled in pavement
And there's a city of seven hills
All our debris flows to the ocean
To meet again, I hope it will

[Chorus]:
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

[Verse 2]:
There is an answer in a question
And there is hope within despair
And there is beauty in a failure
And there are depths beyond compare

There is a role of a lifetime
And there's a song yet to be sung
And there's a dumpster in the driveway
Of all the plans that came undone

[Chorus]
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

There is whiskey in the water
And there is death upon the vine
And there is grace within forgiveness
But it's so hard for me to find

How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?"

Tell me what does it take to make good now
How many years do you wait?
Oh, and now all of the clouds are combining
The flickering light's just a flame
Oh but yeah, I'm so tired
I've been away for so many years
But I guess I'll just wait a bit longer
I'll stay 'til they open the gates

All my life I stay here waiting
Every new year, always making me
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere

1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here

[Verse 2]
Oh well, how many years has it been now?
How many days went to waste?
Now the rain and the thunder are clashing
The Sun's got a smile 'cross the face
Oh, but yeah I'm so tired
I fight so hard and come back beaten
Beacon, burn through it brightly
Soared through a sliver of space

All my life I stay here waiting
Every new year, always making me
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere

1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
Lifted off the ground

Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here

Lift us back to the sky and the world above

This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away

Take me away, take me away

Fall to the ground without a sound

I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear, dream maker, life taker

I think I learned in therapy

And I met the seventh son
​He came for everyone
​The day he heard the lightning in the field
​I heard him clear his throat
​A fork within the road
​That night the Tallahatchie took the wheel

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been throwin' knives
​To see just where they'll land
​Now, my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
​Open your eyes, step in the light
​A jukebox generation
​Just as you were

The voice upon the stage
​Is the heart inside a cage
​And it's singing like a bluebird in the round
​There’s mystery in this wood
​And ghosts within these roots
​That are tangled deep beneath this Southern Ground

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been goin' through life
​Makin' foolish plans
​Now, my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
​Open your eyes, step in the light
​A jukebox generation
​Just as you were, right?
Just as you were
Just as you were, alright!

If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Less you want to move away
From the noise of this place

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me

[Bridge]
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind"
Fairly Localtwenty one pilots,"[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I'm evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, what I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat an' repeat yesterday's dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional

[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I'm not evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional, what I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat to avoid yesterday's dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down

CrystalsOf Monsters And Men,"[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
Lost in skies of powdered gold
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
Showered by the empty hopes
As I tumble down, falling fast to the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

[Verse 2: Nanna]
Making waves in pitch black sand
Feel the salt dance on my hands
Raw and charcoal coloured thighs
Feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin

[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes

But I'm okay in see-through skin
I forgive what is within
Because I'm in this house, I'm in this home

And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes

Nothing Without LoveNate Ruess,"[Intro]
I am nothing without love
I’m but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I’m all alone
But I am nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
But she feeling low she feeling sad
I would take credit for what’s wrong
But I am nothing without love

[Verse 1]
Three years at sea after the storm
On this sinking ship that love had put me on
God I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I got nowhere to go

[Verse 2]
Now here you show up with the force of a wave
And so I'm setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state
Hey hey lord, I don’t want to lose this one, she make me feel whole
You know, I am nothing without love

[Bridge]
Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Come on slide up right here by my side
You know that I, I want to rest in your light
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
I wanna rest in your life
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey

[Verse 3]
I am nothing without love
I’m just these thoughts without a pen
And I would take credit for this song
But I am nothing without love

[Outro]
Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Watch this, come on, come on, come on, come on right by my side
Don't you know that I, don't you know that I
I want to rest in your light
I want to rest in your light
I want to rest in your light
'Cause I am, I am nothing without love"

Night falls, smoke on the water, darkness closes in
Cold white hand in the deep will drown you for your sins

Ramblers in the wilderness we can't find what we need

Face down in the desert now there's a cage locked around my heart

Absolution CallingIncubus,"[Verse 1]
It’s like an intuition, or a feeling in the air
An intangible impression that’s always everywhere
You bit into the apple, laid down your sword and shield
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]
I remember feeling the opposite of falling
(Into that spot, where we untie every knot)
Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”

[Verse 2]
It’s an open invitation, come see the sights of sages
We’ve been a pride of lions, so afraid to leave our cages
Don’t fret over the pieces that smolder in the sun
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Cause nothing can be broken when everything is one
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

I remember feeling the opposite of falling
(Into that spot, where we untie every knot)
Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”

ImagineSawyer Fredericks,"They [blacks] are at least as brave, and more adventure some [compared to whites]. But this may perhaps proceed from a want of fore-thought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present - They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those number-less afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in labor.

- Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia
(187-88) 
Almost nineteenth Euro-American intellectual of the ninteenth century could have written the preceding words.The notion of Negro inferiority was so deeply pervasive among those heirs of ""The Enlightment"" that the categories and even the vocabulary of Negro inferiority were formalized into a tedious, unmodulated litany. This uniformity increased rather than diminished during the course of the century. As Leon Litwack and others have shown, even the Abolitionists, who actively opposed slavery, frequently regarded blacks as inherently inferior. This helps to explain the widespread popularity of colonization schemes among Abolitionists and other liberals.1 As for Jefferson, it is not surprising that he held such ideas, but it is impressive that he formulated so clearly at the end of the eighteenth century what would become the dominant view of the Negro in the nineteenth century. In many ways, this Father of American Democracy - and quite possibly of five mulatto children - was a man of his time and ahead of his time.2

In July of 1876, exactly one century after the American Declaration of Independence, Mark Twain began writing Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a novel which illustrates trenchantly the social limitations which American ""civilization"" imposes on individual freedom. The book takes special note of ways in which racism impinges upon the lives of Afro-Americans, even when they are legally ""free."" It is therefore ironic that Huckleberry Finn has often been attacked and even censored as a racist work. I would argue, on the contrary, that except for Melville's work, Huckleberry Finn is without peers among major Euro-American novels for its explicitly anti-racist stance.3 Those who brand the book ""racist""generally do so without having considered the specific form of racial discourse to which the novel responds. Furthermore, Huckleberry Finn offers much more than the typical liberal defenses of ""human dignity"" and protests against cruelty. Though it contains some such elements, it is more fundamentally a critique of those socially constituted fictions- most notably romanticism, religion, and the concept of ""the Negro"" - which serve to justify and to disguise selfish, cruel, and exploitative behavior.

When I speak of ""racial discourse,"" I mean more than simply attitudes about ""race"" or conventions of talking about ""race."" Most importantly, I mean that ""race"" itself is a discursive formation, which delimits social relations on the basis of alleged physical differences.4 ""Race"" is a strategy for relegating a segment of the population to a permanent inferior status. It functions by insisting that each ""race"" has specific, definitive, inherent behavioral tendencies and capacities, which distinguish it from other ""races."" Though scientifically specious, ""race"" has been powerfully effective as an ideology and as a form of social definition, which serves the interests of Euro-American hegemony. In America, race has been deployed against numerous groups, including Native Americans, Jews, Asians, and even - for brief periods - an assortment of European immigrants.

For obvious reasons, however, the primary emphasis historically has been on defining ""the Negro"" as a deviant from Euro- American norms. ""Race"" in America means white supremacy and black inferiority5; and ""the Negro,"" a socially constituted fiction, is a generalized, one-dimensional surrogate for the historical reality of Afro-American people. It is this reified fiction which Twain attacks in Huckleberry Finn. Twain adopts a strategy of subversion in his attack on race. That is, he focuses on a number of commonplaces associated with ""the Negro,"" and then he systematically dramatizes their inadequacy. He uses the term ""nigger,"" and he shows Jim engaging in superstitious behavior. Yet he portrays Jim as a compassionate, shrewd, thoughtful, self-sacrificing and even wise man. Indeed, his portrayal of Jim contradicts every claim presented in Jefferson's description of ""the Negro."" Jim is cautious, he gives excellent advice, he suffers persistent anguish over separation from his wife and child, and he even sacrifices his own sleep in order that Huck may rest. Jim, in short, exhibits all qualities that ""the Negro"" supposedly lacks. Twain's conclusions do more than merely subvert the justifications of slavery, which was already long since abolished. Twain began this book during the final disintegration of Reconstruction, and his satire on antebellum Southern bigotry is also an implicit response to the Negrophobic climate of the post-Reconstruction era (Berkove; Gollin; Egan, esp. 66-102). It is troubling, therefore, that so many readers have completely misunderstood Twain's subtle attack on racism.

Twain's use of the word ""nigger"" has provoked some readers to reject the novel. (See Hentoff). As one of the most offensive words in our vocabulary, ""nigger"" remains heavily shrouded in taboo. A careful assessment of this term within the context of American racial discourse, however, will allow us to understand the particular way in which the author uses it. If we attend closely to Twain's use of the word, we may find in it not just a trigger to outrage, but more importantly, a means of understanding the precise nature of American racism and Mark Twain's attack on it.

Most obviously, Twain uses ""nigger"" throughout the book as a synonym for ""slave."" There is ample evidence from other sources that this corresponds to one usage common during the Antebellum period. We first encounter it in reference to ""Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim"" (Ch. 2). This usage, like the term ""nigger stealer,"" clearly designates the ""nigger"" as a piece of property: a commodity, a slave. This passage also provides the only apparent textual justification for the common critical practice of labelling Jim, ""Nigger Jim,"" as if ""nigger"" were a part of his proper name. This loathsome habit goes back at least as far as Albert Bigelow Paine's biography of Twain (1912). In any case, ""nigger"" in this sense connotes an inferior, even subhuman, creature, who is properly owned by and subservient to Euro-Americans. Both Huck and Jim use the word in this sense. For example, when Huck fabricates his tale about the riverboat accident, the following exchange occurs between him and Aunt Sally:
'Good gracious! anybody hurt?'
'No'm. Killed a nigger.'
'Well, it's lucky, because sometimes people do
get hurt' (Ch. 32).Huck has never met Aunt Sally prior to this scene, and in spinning a lie which this stranger will find unobjectionable, he correctly assumes that the common notion of Negro subhumanity will be appropriate. Huck's off-hand remark is intended to exploit Aunt Sally's attitudes, not to express Huck's own. A nigger, Aunt Sally confirms, is not a person. Yet this exchange is hilarious, precisely because we know that Huck is playing upon her glib and conventional bigotry. We know that Huck's relationship to Jim has already invalidated for him such obtuse racial notions. The conception of the ""nigger"" is a socially constituted and sanctioned fiction, and it is just as false and as absurd as Huck's explicit fabrication, which Aunt Sally also swallows whole.

In fact, the exchange between Huck and Aunt Sally reveals a great deal about how racial discourse operates. Its function is to promulgate a conception of ""the Negro"" as a subhuman and expendable creature, who is by definition feeble-minded, immoral, lazy, and superstitious. One crucial purpose of this social fiction is to justify the abuse and exploitation of Afro-American people by substituting the essentialist fiction of ""Negro-ism"" for the actual character of individual Afro-Americans. Hence, in racial discourse every Afro-American becomes just another instance of ""the Negro"" - just another ""nigger."" Twain recognizes this invidious tendency of race- thinking, however, and he takes every opportunity to expose the mismatch between racial abstractions and real human beings.

For example, when Pap drunkenly inveighs against the free mulatto from Ohio, he is outraged by what appears to him as a crime against natural laws. (Ch. 6). In the first place, a ""free nigger"" is, for Pap, a contradiction in terms. Indeed, the man's clothes, his demeanor, his education, his profession, and even his silver-headed cane bespeak a social status normally achieved by only a small elite of white men. He is, in other words, a ""nigger"" who refuses to behave like a ""nigger."" Pap's ludicrous protestations discredit both himself and other believers in ""the Negro,"" as many critics have noted. But it has"" not been sufficiently stressed that Pap's racial views correspond very closely to those of most of his white Southern contemporaries, in substance if not in manner of expression. Such views were held not only by poor whites but by all ""right-thinking"" Southerners, regardless of their social class. Indeed, not even the traumas of the Civil War would cure Southerners of this folly. Furthermore, Pap's indignation at the Negro's right to vote is precisely analogous to the Southern backlash against the enfranchisement of Afro-Americans during Reconstruction. Finally, Pap's comments are rather mild compared to the anti-Negro diatribes which were beginning to emerge among politicians even as Twain was writing Huckleberry Finn. He began writing this novel during the final days of Reconstruction, and it seems more than reasonable to assume that the shameful white supremacist bluster of that epoch - exemplified by Pap's tirade - informed Twain's critique of racism in Huckleberry Finn. (See Pettit, Mark Twain and the South, 35-50).

Pap's final description of this Ohio gentlemen as ""a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free-nigger"" (Ch. 6) almost totally contradicts his previous description of the man as a proud, elegant, dignified figure. Yet this contradiction is perfectly consistent with Pap's need to reassert ""the Negro"" in lieu of social reality. Despite the vulgarity of Pap's personal character, his thinking about race is highly conventional and, therefore, respectable. But most of us cannot respect Pap's views, and when we reject them, we reject the standard racial discourse of both 1840 and 1880.

A reader who objects to the word ""nigger"" might still insist that Twain could have avoided using it. But it is difficult to imagine how Twain could have debunked a discourse without using the specific terms of that discourse. Even when Twain was writing his book, ""nigger"" was universally recognized as an insulting, demeaning word. According to Stuart Berg Flexner, ""Negro"" was generally pronounced as ""nigger"" until about 1825, at which time Abolitionists began objecting to that term (57). They preferred ""colored person"" or ""person of color."" Hence, W. E. B. Du Bois reports that some black Abolitionists of the early 1830s declared themselves united ""as men, . . . not as slaves; as 'people of color,' not as 'Negroes' "" (245). Writing a generation later in Army Life in a Black Regiment (1869), Thomas Wentworth Higginson deplored the common use of ""nigger"" among freedmen, which he regarded as evidence of low self-esteem (28). The objections to ""nigger,"" then, are not a consequence of the modern sensibility but had been common for a half century before Huckleberry Finn was published. The specific function of this term in the book, however, is neither to offend nor merely to provide linguistic authenticity. Much more importantly, it establishes a context against which Jim's specific virtues may emerge as explicit refutations of racist presuppositions.

Of course, the concept of the ""nigger"" entails far more than just the deployment of certain vocabulary. Most of the attacks on the book focus on its alleged perpetuation of racial stereotypes. Twain does indeed use racial stereotypes here. That practice could be excused as characteristic of the genre of humor within which Twain works. Frontier humor relies upon the use of stock types, and consequently, racial stereotypes are just one of many types present in Huckleberry Finn. Yet while valid, such an appeal to generic convention would be unsatisfactory, because it would deny Twain the credit which he deserves for the sophistication of his perceptions (see Ellison, Hansen, Lynn).

As a serious critic of American society, Twain recognized that racial discourse depends upon the deployment of a system of stereotypes which constitute ""the Negro"" as fundamentally different from and inferior to Euro-Americans. As with his handling of ""nigger,"" Twain's strategy with racial stereotypes is to elaborate them in order to undermine them. To be sure, those critics are correct who have argued that Twain uses this narrative to reveal Jim's humanity. Jim, however, is just one individual. Much more importantly, Twain uses the narrative to expose the cruelty and hollowness of that racial discourse which exists only to obscure the humanity of all Afro-American people.

One aspect of Huckleberry Finn which has elicited copious critical commentary is Twain's use of superstition (see especially Hoffman, ""Jim's Magic""). In nineteenth century racial discourse, ""the Negro"" was always defined as inherently superstitious.6 Many critics, therefore, have cited Jim's superstitious behavior as an instance of negative stereotyping. One cannot deny that in this respect Jim closely resembles the entire tradition of comic darkies (see Woodard and MacCann), but to observe this similarity is a negligible feat. The issue is, does Twain merely reiterate cliches, or does he use these conventional patterns to make an unconventional point? A close examination will show that in virtually every instance, Twain uses Jim's superstition to make points which undermine rather than revalidate the dominant racial discourse.

The first incident of this superstitious behavior occurs in Chapter 2, as a result of one of Tom Sawyer's pranks. When Jim falls asleep under a tree, Tom hangs his hat on a branch. Subsequently, Jim concocts an elaborate tale about having been hexed and ridden by witches. The tale grows more grandiose with subsequent retellings, and eventually Jim becomes a local celebrity, sporting a five-cent piece on a string around his neck as a talisman. ""Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country,"" the narrator reports. Jim's celebrity finally reaches the point that ""Jim was most ruined, for a servant, because he got so stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches."" This is, no doubt, amusing. Yet whether Jim believes his own tale or not - and the ""superstitious Negro"" thesis requires us to assume that he does - the fact remains that Jim clearly benefits from becoming more a celebrity and less a ""servant."" It is his owner, not Jim, who suffers when Jim's uncompensated labor diminishes.7

This incident has often been interpreted as an example of risible Negro gullibility and ignorance, as exemplified by blackface minstrelsy. Such a reading has more than a little validity, but can only partially account for the implications of this scene. If not for the final sentence, such an account might seem wholly satisfactory, but the information that Jim becomes, through his own storytelling, unsuited for life as a slave, introduces unexpected complications. Is it likely that Jim has been deceived by his own creative prevarications - especially given what we learn about his character subsequently? Or has he cleverly exploited the conventions of ""Negro superstition"" in order to turn a silly boy's prank to his own advantage?

Regardless of whether we credit Jim with forethought in this matter, it is undeniable that he turns Tom's attempt to humiliate him into a major personal triumph. In other words, Tom gives him an inch, and he takes an ell. It is also obvious that he does so by exercising remarkable skills as a rhetorician. By constructing a fictitious narrative of his own experience, Jim elevates himself above his prescribed station in life. By becoming, in effect, an author, Jim writes himself a new destiny. Jim's triumph may appear to be dependent upon the gullibility of other ""superstitious"" Negroes, but since we have no direct encounter with them, we cannot know whether they are unwitting victims of Jim's ruse or not. A willing audience need not be a totally credulous one. In any case, it is intelligence, not stupidity, which facilitates Jim's triumph. Tom may have had his chuckle, but the last laugh, clearly, belongs to Jim.

In assessing Jim's character, we should keep in mind that forethought, creativity and shrewdness are qualities which racial discourse - see Thomas Jefferson - denies to ""the Negro."" In that sense, Jim's darky performance here subverts the fundamental definition of the darky. For ""the Negro"" is defined to be an object, not a subject. Yet does an object construct its own narrative? Viewed in this way, the fact of superstition, which traditionally connotes ignorance and unsophistication, becomes far less important than the ends to which superstition is put. This inference exposes, once again, the inadequacy of a positivist epistemology, which holds, for example, that ""a rose is a rose is a rose."" No one will deny the self-evidence of a tautology; but a rose derives whatever meaning it has from the context within which it is placed (including the context of traditional symbolism.) It is the contextualizing activity, not das Ding-an-sich, which generates meaning. Again and again, Twain attacks racial essentialism by directing our attention, instead, to the particularity of individual action. We find that Jim is not ""the Negro."" Jim is Jim, and we, like Huck, come to understand what Jim is by attending to what he does in specific situations.

In another instance of explicitly superstitious behavior, Jim uses a hairball to tell Huck's fortune. One may regard this scene as a comical example of Negro ignorance and credulity, acting in concert with the ignorance and credulity of a fourteen-year-old white boy. That reading would allow one an unambiguous laugh at Jim's expense. If one examines the scene carefully, however, the inadequacy of such a reductive reading becomes apparent. Even if Jim does believe in the supernatural powers of this hairball, the fact remains that most of the transaction depends upon Jim's quick wits. For example, the soothsaying aside, much of the exchange between Huck and Jim is an exercise in wily and understated economic bartering. In essence, Jim wants to be paid for his services, while Huck wants free advice. Jim insists that the hairball will not speak without being paid. Huck, who has a dollar, will only admit to having a counterfeit quarter. Jim responds by pretending to be in collusion with Huck. He explains how to doctor the ""quarter"" so that ""anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball"" (Ch. 4). But obviously it is not the hair-ball who will benefit from acquiring and spending this counterfeit coin (cf. Weaver and Williams).

In this transaction, Jim serves his own interests while appearing to serve Huck's interests. He takes a slug which is worthless to Huck, and through the alchemy of his own cleverness, he contrives to make it worth twenty-five cents to himself. That, in antebellum America, is not a bad price for telling a fortune. But more importantly, Twain shows Jim self- consciously subverting the prescribed definition of ""the Negro,"" even as he performs within the limitations of that role. He remains the conventional ""Negro"" by giving the white boy what he wants, at no real cost, and by consistently appearing to be passive and subservient to the desires of Huck and the hair-ball. But in fact, he serves his own interests all along. Such resourcefulness is hardly consistent with the familiar, one-dimensional concept of ""the superstitious Negro.""

And while Jim's reading is formulaic, it is hardly simple-minded. He sees the world as a kind of Manichean universe, in which forces of light and darkness - white and black - vie for dominance. Pap, he says, is uncertain what to do, torn between his white and black angels. Jim's advice, ""to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way"" (Ch. 4), turns out to be good advice, because Huck greatly enjoys life in the cabin, despite Pap's fits of drunken excess. This mixture of pleasure and pain is precisely what Jim predicts. Admittedly, Jim's conceptual framework is not original. Nonetheless, his reading carries considerable force, because it corresponds so neatly to the dominant thematic patterns in this book, and more broadly, to the sort of dualistic thinking which informs much of Twain's work. (To take an obvious example, consider the role reversals and character contrasts in Pudd'n-head Wilson or The Prince and the Pauper). And most immediately, Jim's comments here reflect tellingly upon his situation as a black slave in racist America. The slave's fate is always torn between his master's will and his own.

In this reading and other incidents, Jim emerges as an astute and sensitive observer of human behavior, both in his comments regarding Pap and in his subtle remarks to Huck. Jim clearly possesses a subtlety and intelligence which ""the Negro"" allegedly lacks. Twain makes this point more clearly in the debate scene in Chapter 15. True enough, most of this debate is, as several critics have noted, conventional minstrel show banter. Nevertheless, Jim demonstrates impressive reasoning abilities, despite his factual ignorance. For example, in their argument over ""Poly-voo-franzy,"" Huck makes a category error by implying that the difference between languages is analogous to the difference between human language and cat language. While Jim's response - that man should talk like a man - betrays his ignorance of cultural diversity, his argument is perceptive and structurally sound. The humor in Huck' s conclusion, ""you can't learn a nigger how to argue,"" arises precisely from our recognition that Jim's argument is better than Huck's.

Throughout the novel, Twain presents Jim in ways which render ludicrous the conventional wisdom about ""Negro character."" As an intelligent, sensitive, wily and considerate individual, Jim demonstrates that one's race provides no useful index of one's character. While that point may seem obvious to many contemporary readers, it is a point rarely made by nineteenth-century Euro-American novelists. Indeed, except for Melville, J. W. DeForest, Albion Tourgee, and George Washington Cable, white novelists virtually always portrayed Afro-American characters as exemplifications of ""Negroness."" In this regard, the twentieth century has been little better. By presenting us a series of glimpses which penetrate the ""Negro"" exterior and reveal the person beneath it, Twain debunks American racial discourse. For racial discourse maintains that the ""Negro"" exterior is all that a ""Negro"" really has.

This insight in itself is a notable accomplishment. Twain, however, did not view racism as an isolated phenomenon, and it was his effort to place racism within the context of other cultural traditions which produced the most problematic aspect of his novel. For it is in the final chapters - the Tom Sawyer section - which most critics consider the weakest part of the book, that Twain links his criticisms of slavery and Southern romanticism, condemning the cruelties which both of these traditions entail. (See Altenbernd). Critics have objected to these chapters on various grounds. Some of the most common are that Jim becomes reduced to a comic darky (e.g., Marx, Schmitz), that Tom's antics undermine the seriousness of the novel, and that these burlesque narrative developments destroy the structural integrity of the novel. Most critics see this conclusion as an evasion of the difficult issues which the novel has raised. There is no space here for a discussion of the structural issues, but it seems to me that as a critique of American racial discourse, these concluding chapters offer a harsh, coherent, and uncompromising indictment.

Tom Sawyer's absurd scheme to ""rescue"" Jim offends, because the section begins with Huck's justly celebrated crisis of conscience, which culminates in his resolve to free Jim, even if doing so condemns him to hell. The passage which leads to Huck's decision, as familiar as it is, merits reexamination:
I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around, and see that paper ....I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: 'All right, then, I'll go to hell' - and tore it up (Ch.31).The issue here is not just whether or not Huck should return a contraband8 - an escaped slave - to its proper owner. More fundamentally, Huck must decide whether to accept the conventional wisdom which defines ""Negroes"" as subhuman commodities, or the evidence of his own experience, which has shown Jim to be a good and kind man and a true friend.

Huck makes the obvious decision, but his doing so represents more than simply a liberal choice of conscience over social convention. Twain explicitly makes Huck's choice a sharp attack on the Southern church. Huck scolds himself: ""Here was the Sunday school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd done it they'd a learnt you, there, that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire"" (Ch. 31). Yet despite Huck's anxiety, his choice is obviously correct. Furthermore, by the time that Twain wrote these words, more than twenty years of national strife, including Civil War and Reconstruction, had established Huck's conclusion regarding slavery as a dominant national consensus. Not even reactionary Southerners advocated a reinstitution of slavery. Since the Southern church had taught that slavery was God's will, Huck's decision flatly repudiates the church's teachings regarding slavery. And implicitly, it also repudiates the church as an institution by suggesting that the church functions to undermine, not to encourage, a reliance on one's conscience. To define ""Negroes"" as subhuman removes them from moral consideration and therefore justifies the callous exploitation of them. This view of religion is consistent with the cynical iconoclasm which Twain expressed in Letters from the Earth and others of his ""dark"" works.9

In this context, Tom Sawyer appears to us as a superficially charming but fundamentally distasteful interloper. His actions are governed not by conscience but rather by romantic conventions and literary ""authorities."" Indeed, while Tom may appear to be a kind of renegade, he is in essence thoroughly conventional in his values and proclivities. Despite all his boyish pranks, Tom represents a kind of solid respectability- a younger version of the Southern gentleman, as exemplified by the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons (see Hoffman, Form and Fable, 327-28). Hence, when Tom proposes to help Huck steal Jim, Huck laments that ""Tom Sawyer fell, considerable, in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer a nigger stealen"" (Ch. 33). Such liberating activity is proper for Huck, who is not respectable, but not for Tom, who is. As with the previous example, however, this one implies a deep criticism of the status quo. Huck's act of conscience, which most of us would now endorse, is possible only for an outsider. This hardly speaks well for the moral integrity of Southern (or American) ""civilization.""

To examine Tom's role in the novel, let us begin at the end. Upon learning of the failed escape attempt and Jim's recapture, Tom cries out, self-righteously: ""turn him loose! He ain't no slave; he's as free as any creatur that walks this earth"" (Ch. 42). Tom has known all along that his cruel and ludicrous scheme to rescue the captured ""prisoner"" was being enacted upon a free man; and indeed, only his silence regarding Jim's status allowed the scheme to proceed with Jim's cooperation. Certainly, neither Huck nor Jim would otherwise have indulged Tom's foolishness. Tom's gratuitous cruelty here in the pursuit of his own amusement corresponds to his less vicious prank against Jim in Chapter 2 . And just as before, Twain converts Tom's callous mischief into a personal triumph for Jim.

Not only has Jim suffered patiently, which would in truth represent a doubtful virtue. (Jim is not Uncle Tom.) Jim demonstrates his moral superiority by surrendering himself in order to assist the doctor in treating his wounded tormentor. This is hardly the behavior which one would expect from a commodity, and it is precisely Jim's status - man or chattel - which has been fundamentally at issue throughout the novel. It may be true that Tom's lengthy juvenile antics subvert the tone of the novel, but they also provide the necessary backdrop for Jim's noble act. Up to this point, we have been able to admire Jim's good sense and to respond sentimentally to his good character. This, however, is the first time that we see him making a significant (and wholly admirable) moral decision. His act sets him apart from everyone else in the novel except Huck. And modestly (if not disingenuously), he claims to be behaving just as Tom Sawyer would. Always conscious of his role as a ""Negro,"" Jim knows better than to claim personal credit for his good deed. Yet the contrast between Jim's behavior and Tom's is unmistakable. Huck declares that Jim is ""white inside"" (Ch. 40). He apparently intends this as a compliment, but Tom is fortunate that Jim does not behave like most of the whites in the novel.

Twain also contrasts Jim's self-sacrificing compassion with the cruel and mean-spirited behavior of his captors, emphasizing that white skin does not justify claims of superior virtue. They abuse Jim, verbally and physically, and some want to lynch him as an example to other slaves. The moderates among them, however, resist, pointing out that they could be made to pay for the destruction of private property. As Huck observes: ""the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right, is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him (Ch. 42). As if these enforcers of white supremacy did not appear contemptible enough already, Twain then has the doctor describe Jim as the best and most faithful nurse he has ever seen, despite Jim's ""resking his freedom"" and his obvious fatigue. These vigilantes do admit that Jim deserves to be rewarded, but their idea of a reward is to cease punching and cursing him. They are not even generous enough to remove Jim's heavy shackles. Ultimately, Huckleberry Finn renders a harsh judgment on American society. Freedom from slavery, the novel implies, is not freedom from gratuitous cruelty; and racism, like romanticism, is finally just an elaborate justification which the adult counterparts of Tom Sawyer use to facilitate their exploitation and abuse of other human beings. Tom feels guilty, with good reason, for having exploited Jim, but his final gesture of paying Jim off is less an insult to Jim than it is Twain's commentary on Tom himself. Just as slaveholders believe that economic relations (ownership) can justify their privilege of mistreating other human beings, Tom apparently believes that an economic exchange can suffice as atonement for his misdeeds. Perhaps he finds a forty-dollar token more affordable than an apology. But then, just as Tom could only ""set a free nigger free,"" considering, as Huck says, ""his bringing-up"" (Ch. 42), he similarly could hardly be expected to apologize for his pranks. Huck, by contrast, is equally rich, but he has apologized to Jim earlier in the novel. And this is the point of Huck's final remark, rejecting the prospect of civilization. To become civilized is not just to become like Aunt Sally. More immediately, it is to become like Tom Sawyer.

Jim is, indeed, ""as free as any creatur that walks this earth."" In other words, he is a man, like all men, at the mercy of other men's arbitrary cruelties. In a sense, given Twain's view of freedom, to allow Jim to escape to the North or to have Tom announce Jim's manumission earlier would be an evasion of the novel's ethical insights. While one may escape from legal bondage, there is no escape from the cruelties of this ""civilization."" There is no promised land, where one may enjoy absolute personal freedom. An individual's freedom is always constrained by one's social relations to other people. Being legally free does not spare Jim from gratuitous humiliation and physical suffering in the final chapters, precisely because Jim is still regarded as a ""nigger."" Even if he were as accomplished as the mulatto from Ohio, he would not be exempt from mistreatment. Furthermore, since Tom represents the hegemonic values of his society, Jim's ""freedom"" amounts to little more than an obligation to live by his wits and to make the best of a bad situation.

Slavery and racism, then, are social evils which take their places alongside various others which the novel documents, such as the insane romanticism that inspires the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons blithely to murder each other, generation after generation. Twain rejects entirely the mystification of race and demonstrates that Jim is in most ways a better man than the men who regard him as their inferior. But he also shows how little correlation there may be between the treatment one deserves and the treatment one receives.

If this conclusion sounds uncontroversial from the perspective of 1984, we would do well to remember that it contradicts entirely the overwhelming and optimistic consensus of 1884. And no other nineteenth-century novel so effectively locates racial discourse within the context of a general critique of American institutions and traditions. Indeed, the novel suggests that real individual freedom, in this land of the free, cannot be found. ""American civilization"" enslaves and exploits rather than liberates. It is hardly an appealing message.

Given the subtlety of Mark Twain's approach, it is not surprising that most of his contemporaries misunderstood or simply ignored the novel's demystification of race. Despite their patriotic rhetoric, they, like Pap, were unprepared to take seriously the implications of ""freedom, justice, and equality."" They, after all, espoused an ideology and an explicit language of race which was virtually identical to Thomas Jefferson's. Yet racial discourse flatly contradicts and ultimately renders hypocritical the egalitarian claims of liberal democracy. The heart of Twain's message to us is that an honest person must reject one or the other. But hypocrisy, not honesty, is our norm. For too many of us continue to assert both racial distinction and liberal values, simultaneously. If we, a century later, continue to be confused about Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, perhaps it is because we remain more deeply committed to both racial discourse and a self-deluding optimism than we care to admit.

Notes

1. The literature on the Abolition movement and on antebellum debates regarding the Negro is, of course, voluminous. George Fredrickson's excellent The Black Image in the White Mind is perhaps the best general work of its kind. Fredrickson's The Inner Civil War is also valuable, especialy pp. 53-64. Leon Litwack closely examines the ambivalence of Abolitionists regarding racial intermingling (214-46). Benjamin Quarles presents the most detailed examination of black Abolitionists, though Vincent Harding offers a more vivid (and overtly polemical) account of their relationships to white Abolitionists (101-194).

2. The debate over Jefferson's relationship to Sally Hemings has raged for two centuries. The most thorough scholarly accounts are by Fawn Brodie, who suggests that Jefferson did have a prolonged involvement with Hemings, and by Virginius Dabney, who endeavors to exonerate Jefferson of such charges. Barbara Chase-Riboud presents a fictionalized version of this relationship in Sally Hemings. The first Afro-American novel, Clotel; Or the President's Daughter (1853) by William Wells Brown, was also based on this alleged affair.

3. For dates of composition, see Blair. For a discussion of Melville's treatment of race, Carolyn Karchner's Shadow Over the Promised Land is especially valuable. Articles on Benito Cereño by Joyce Adler and Jean Yellin are also noteworthy. Rayford Logan and Lawrence J. Friedman provide detailed accounts of the racist climate in Post-Reconstruction America, emphasizing the literary manifestations of such attitudes. Friedman's discussion of George Washington Cable (99-118), the outspoken Southern liberal, is very informative. For a general historical overview of the period, C. Vann Woodward's work remains unsurpassed. John W. Cell offers a provocative reconsideration of Woodward's arguments, and Joel Williamson's new book documents the excessively violent tendencies of Southern racism at the end of the century.

4. My use of ""racial discourse"" has some affinities to Foucault's conception of ""discourse."" This is not, however, a strictly Foucaultian reading. While Foucault's definition of discursive practices provides one of the most sophisticated tools presently available for cultural analysis, his conception of power seems to me problematic. I prefer an account of power which allows for a consideration of interest and hegemony. Theorists such as Marshall Berman (34-35) and Catherine MacKinnon (526) have indicated similar reservations. Frank Lentriccia, however, has made a provocative attempt to modify Foucaultian analysis, drawing upon Gramsci's analysis of hegemony. See Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, Power/ Knowledge (esp. 92-108), and The History of Sexuality, (esp. 92-102).

5. This is not to discount the sufferings of other groups. But historically, the philosophical basis of Western racial discourse- which existed even before the European ""discovery"" of America- has been the equation of ""good"" and ""evil"" with light and darkness (or, white and black.) (See Derrida; Jordan, 1-40; and West, 47-65). Economically, the slave trade, chattel slavery, agricultural peonage, and color-coded wage differentials have made the exploitation of African-Americans the most profitable form of racism. Finally, Afro- Americans have long been the largest American ""minority"" group. Consequently, the primacy of ""the Negro"" in American racial discourse is, to use Althusser's term (87-126), ""Overdetermined."" The acknowledgment of primary status, however, is hardly a claim of privilege.

6. Even the allegedly scientific works on the Negro focused on superstition as a definitive trait. See, for example, W. D. Weatherford and Jerome Dowd. No one has commented more scathingly on Negro superstition than William H. Thomas, who was, by American definitions, a Negro himself.

7. Hoffman in Form and Fable (331) reveals an implicit understanding of Jim's creativity, but he does not pursue the point in detail.

8. This term became a part of the official military vocabulary during the Civil War, referring to a slave who had gone ""AWOL.""

9. A number of works comment on Twain's religious views and the relation between his critiques of religion and of racism. See Ensor; Pettit, ""Mark Train and the Negro""; and Gollin.

10. I would like to thank my colleagues, David Langston and Michael Bell, for the helpful suggestions which they offered to me regarding this essay.

Chapter II.

BRIAN REED:
In one of my first phone conversations with John, before we'd met, I asked him if he thought it was possible that maybe Kabrahm Burt hadn't killed anybody, if it was possible that the murder he'd contacted me about was actually just a rumor, a fiction. No, John said, there was little doubt in his mind that it was true. And then, by way of explanation, he launched into this parable.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Let me tell you something I saw one time.

BRIAN REED:
I should admit that at the time, this story was completely lost on me.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Me and Roger Price had went up to the truck stop together to get a little dinner. We came back by, and was passing by the South Forty trailer park. So Roger's one of these dudes, he's a darn transmission mechanic. He's not really talkative. He's a good dude, but he just—you know, he only has one tooth. And it's really amusing to see how he can balance a cigarette on that one tooth. And the whole time he's talking—

[LAUGHTER]

—this cigarette is just bouncing around all over that one tooth, and he never loses that son of a bitch. So we're coming by this ""Welcome to South Forty"" sign, and there's this girl out there walking around in front of the damn sign holding a cell phone, and she's got on a pink top and nothing else—no fucking panties, no goddamn socks, barefoot. And I remark that to Roger. I don't remember what I said. I probably said, ""my God, look at her,"" or something like that. And Roger's sage advice was, usually when you see jokers that look like that, they done something to get like that.

BRIAN REED:
That's the lesson?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
That went just straight through you.

BRIAN REED:
Like so many things having to do with John, it took me a long time to understand the meaning of this story—years. But I think I finally get it now. From Serial and This American Life, I'm Brian Reed. This is Shittown.

My second night in Alabama, I finally get to talk to Jake Goodson. Jake's the guy who'd originally told John that Kabrahm Burt had bragged to him outside the Little Caesars about beating a guy to death. I sit with Jake in John's kitchen, asking him to rack his brain for any extra details that could help me solve this. It was a while ago, he says. His memories are fuzzy. But he makes a suggestion that, I don't know, seems crazy to me.

JAKE GOODSON:
I don't know. I mean, I could get him and ask him, and he'll be able to tell me. He'd probably come up here and talk to you about it.

BRIAN REED:
Who?

JAKE GOODSON:
Kabrahm.

BRIAN REED:
Kabrahm lives right nearby. Why not just get it from the horse's mouth?

BRIAN REED:
No.

JAKE GOODSON:
Probably so.

BRIAN REED:
That makes no sense. I would stick a microphone in his face and he would tell me about a guy he killed?

JAKE GOODSON:
Probably. He's burnt up. He wouldn't know no better. He'd probably just laugh about it with you.

BRIAN REED:
I told Jake no thanks, at least not now. I do not feel like I'm armed with enough information to confront Kabrahm yet. Aside from seeming far-fetched, the idea also just sounded potentially dangerous, for John, for Jake, and for me. But then the next night, a bunch of other people proposed the exact same thing.

MAN 1:
He'll talk to you, dude.

MAN 2:
I mean, he's burnt out.

MAN 1:
He's arrogant, dude. He don't give a fuck.

BRIAN REED:
He would talk to me about it?

MAN 3:
I know he would. I'm pretty sure he would.

MAN 1:
He'd probably tell you truth.

BRIAN REED:
I'm chatting with a few guys in a tattoo parlor, all of whom have heard about the murder. Some are pretty sure they heard it from Kabrahm himself.

MAN 4:
You want me to call him and ask him?

BRIAN REED:
No, don't do that.

MAN 4:
Why? I'm not a puss, dude. I don't give a fuck.

BRIAN REED:
Apparently I'm the puss, because I do not want the dudes I'm talking to to call Kabrahm right now. Already, this tattoo shop does not feel like the safest place to walk into alone at night, trying to dig up info about a covered-up murder by a guy everyone seems to know, all of which are things I've just done. The last thing I want right now is for the alleged murderer to show up.

I was invited here by Tyler Goodson, Jake's brother, whom I met in John's workshop while he was filing that chainsaw. He's one of the owners. Tyler knows Kabrahm. They're both in their early 20s, and I thought maybe some of Tyler's friends who hang out here might have more information about the possible murder. John didn't feel like coming with me because he doesn't like driving at night.

When I walk in, at first it seems like a pretty small place, just a couple of tattooing stations and a little waiting area. But if you push the back wall of the shop, it swings open. It's a secret door, which leads into a hidden clubhouse in the back. There's a bar with some people around it, a pool table, a small stage with motorcycles parked there, and a brass stripper pole that's currently vacant.

The shop is called Black Sheep Ink, and I'll learn that the guys who hang out here take the name to heart. They see themselves as a collection of misfits, of self-proclaimed criminals and runaways and hillbillies. And Tyler has built this place as a haven for them, a place to swap their tales of getting jerked around by cops and judges and clerks and bosses, and to cultivate a sense of pride in their status as the outcasts of their world.

There's this gentleman, whose name I never do catch, who tells me, quote, ""I'm so fucking fat, I don't care no more,"" and lifts up his shirt to show me the giant words he has tattooed on his stomach—""Feed Me.""

MAN 4:
Tell him. Tell him. Give him a picture. I'm a 6-foot, 350-pound bearded man in a John Deere hat with ""Feed Me"" on my belly, just so y'all get a clear picture here.

BRIAN REED:
There's a guy who's been wearing the same trucker hat for seven years.

MAN 5:
Seven years, same hat.

BRIAN REED:
Then there's this guy.

[JACKHAMMER NOISE]

People call him Razor.

RAZOR:
Beep, beep. Back it up. I was parked on the side of the road. I looked down there. I said, son of a bitch. He wakes up. You have Willard come by, see him laying in the yard, thought he died. Ambulance is there. They already called the ambulance, man. Bastard's laying out there in the yard, got an ounce of pot laying beside him, six beers. He's just shit-faced.

BRIAN REED:
I believe he's telling a story about his friend Willard, who is impervious to death.

RAZOR:
You know, I run over him three times in one fucking night. Three times, dude, one night. The bastard won't die.

BRIAN REED:
And then there's Tyler, who's been sleeping at the tattoo parlor lately because he can't afford anywhere else to spend the night, who's 23 years old and has three daughters with three different women, and who's been haunted his whole life by people assuming he's just like his father—his father who abused him and his siblings and his mother, and who is a convicted sex offender for having sex with a minor. One day, Tyler will tell me that he often wakes up in the morning in a puddle of sweat, having dreamt during the night of killing his dad.

Tyler's friendly to me when I arrive, welcoming, but as I'm getting out my recording equipment, I hear murmurs from other people wondering who I am, wondering if I might be a cop. People are asking me questions, feeling me out. A few guys ask if I'll smoke a bowl with them out of some deer antlers. I don't want to be stoned, but I also don't want to seem like a narc, so I pretend to take a puff.

I pretend to do a number of things that make me feel very uncomfortable in order to keep as low a profile as possible, such as act like I'm not shocked or upset or scared when someone says this to me, a radio producer with a microphone, in the first few minutes that we're talking. At the risk of ruining any surprise, the statement is racist and nonsensical, replete with multiple uses of a terrible word.

BUBBA:
You know, we had a tax-free labor. It didn't have nothing to do with a bunch of niggers picking cotton. And we worked our ass off, and we got—we earned everything we got.

BRIAN REED:
This is a tattoo artist who goes by Bubba.

BUBBA:
So now we have no—if you got a taxpaying job, you got to take care of some nigger's wife that's in jail because she's drawing a child support check—

BRIAN REED:
Later, Bubba will display a rather fluent knowledge of the differences between various white supremacy groups. Mind you, we're in a majority-black city right now, Bessemer, about 20 minutes from Bibb County, heading towards Birmingham. But everyone in here is white, including me. Someone mentions offhand that the small tattoo area in front is about as much shop as you want here in Bessemer. Otherwise, the place will be filled with black people who'll piss you off and won't pay anything—hence the secret door.

Before I left for Alabama, my girlfriend, Solange—now my wife—who is black and whose family is from the South, had insisted I make my Facebook and Instagram accounts private, because they're filled with pictures of us together. I told her she was being silly, overly paranoid. Now I'm grateful I decided at the last minute to follow her advice.

When someone asked me what the women looked like up in New York, I tell them they're all shapes, sizes, and colors. When someone asks what my ethnicity is, I tell them about the Italian part without mentioning the Russian Jew part. But there's no hiding the fact that I'm a Yankee.

BRIAN REED:
What's that?

BUBBA:
Y'all just as racist as we are.

BRIAN REED:
It's quieter.

BUBBA:
Y'all left them the fuck down here.

[LAUGHTER]

BRIAN REED:
In an effort to change the subject, I turn the conversation to one of the few things I know I have in common with these guys—

BRIAN REED:
So you guys know John?

BRIAN REED:
—our mutual acquaintance, John B. McLemore.

MAN 6:
Oh, yeah.

MAN 1:
He's a character.

MAN 5:
I ain't never met nobody else like him.

MAN 6:
Nobody. Nobody. Nobody like him.

MAN 7:
—nobody else like that folk.

MAN 6:
He been bugging the piss out of you?

BRIAN REED:
What's that?

MAN 6:
Has he been bugging the piss out of you?

BRIAN REED:
I'm not there yet, but it's exhausting to hang out with him for a long day.

MAN 6:
Damn right.

WOMAN:
(AMUSED) Who says ""exhausting?""

MAN 2:
He's exhausted after all day.

BRIAN REED:
Well, it's—

MAN 6:
He needs to slow the fuck down is what you want to tell him. Slow down.

BRIAN REED:
They tell me John comes around the tattoo parlor pretty often, and likes to lecture them and give them a hard time. He'll argue with them about their views on the South, on politics, on race. Bubba says he'll submit them to tirades about the coming climate and energy apocalypses.

BUBBA:
About how we was running out of fossil fuels and the world was going to come to a fucking end, and—

BRIAN REED:
John tells off their customers for talking about what he sees as inane shit, tells these guys that their lives are amounting to nothing, that they're examples in the flesh of what's wrong with this place.

JOEL:
He thinks everybody's a failure. Everything that's going on is a failure.

BRIAN REED:
This is another tattoo artist, Joel.

BRIAN REED:
He calls you guys failures?

JOEL:
Fuck yeah, he calls us failures, you know what I mean?

BRIAN REED:
Like jokingly, or—

JOEL:
No. Everybody's a failure. Like in his brain, everybody's a failure. For all I know, you could be a failure. You know, sometimes I wish he'd kind of fail—

BRIAN REED:
These guys dish it out, too. They tease John for his many peculiarities, like how he'll devour whatever leftover food is around, no matter how old or rock-hard it is, his inability to buy new shoes to alleviate his athlete's foot, which he's allegedly had for three years, his extemporaneous solving of math problems, his utter aversion to being in a room with more than two or three people at a time, his living with his mom his whole life, his being a loner.

It's friendly, though. They like John. After all, John is the granddaddy of all black sheep, so this crew gets him. They truly seem to accept him, though that doesn't stop them from wondering—

MAN 4:
Love to know what he's worth.

BRIAN REED:
""I'd love to know what he's worth,"" the ""Feed Me"" guy says.

MAN 4:
Just not because I give a fuck, but just to know why does he live like that, you know what I mean?

TYLER GOODSON:
—poor as a church mouse.

BRIAN REED:
That's Tyler saying he lives like he's poor as a church mouse. And Tyler would know. He and John are close. He's the only reason all these guys know John.

Tyler helped build John's maze. He's done all sorts of different odd jobs for him. He's over there all the time. And as far as the church mouse, I did notice that John's refrigerator is pretty bare. His mom invited me to stay for dinner one night so long as I didn't mind eating like po' folks, she told me, in a way where I couldn't tell if she was joking. They live without air conditioning, without TV.

It's mysterious to me, too, because at the same time, John has all these dogs he feeds and brings to the vet, this elaborate yard that requires constant upkeep. He mentioned to me that he spent more than $60,000 on the maze alone. ""Feed Me"" guy says to Tyler—

MAN 4:
I don't understand why, if he's as loaded as you say—

TYLER GOODSON:
Oh, he's worth millions.

BRIAN REED:
Millions?

MAN 4:
Have you not done any research on John?

BRIAN REED:
Tyler explains that John's family comes from money. He says that one of his grandpas was a judge, and that John got an inheritance, played the stock market with it, and made even more money. Plus, aside from all that, Tyler says John made good bank restoring old clocks. All of that sounds like it could be true enough. But then Tyler and his friends start listing off John's assets, and I can't tell if any of that is real, or if they're just letting their imaginations fill in the blanks about their local Boo Radley.

They claim John has $400,000 in cash, 100-some-odd thousand worth of tools in the workshop, all the antiques around his house. You're going to get $150,000 if you sell that old-ass shit, Bubba says. Rare books in the basement, a single clock worth $10,000 that's just sitting on the floor in a plastic storage bin. Not to mention, says Tyler—

TYLER GOODSON:
Gold that his granddaddy—his granddaddy's gold, his daddy's gold.

BRIAN REED:
Tyler's up on the counter of the bar, crouching. He has a brown briefcase he carries around with him. He calls it his minister's case. It has a sticker that says minister slapped on the outside, and it's filled with his tattoo machines and a gun and his welder's cap and some nipple jewelry, and his Black Sheep Ink business cards, and also his minister's license, which he got online because he wanted to found a non-denominational church, where people of all backgrounds could come together and talk it out.

This clubhouse is meant to be a version of that. He says it's his church. Tyler stares down at us from the corner of the bar, like he's about to divulge a secret. When it comes to John, he says, there's no telling—

TYLER GOODSON:
What he's got, because there's a lot of shit that I'm sure I don't know about, because I've been finding stuff out slowly over the years. And there's secret little dungeons and shit under his damn house, man. I ain't playing. I've built gates for them. I've built gates for these secret dungeons.

BRIAN REED:
I've built gates for the dungeons, Tyler's telling me—dungeons in John's basement. He soon clarifies they're actually old crawlspaces, but the way John had him rig them up, Tyler says, with tiny doors and these locking iron gates inside, dividing them into sections—what was the purpose of all that? It was creepy. But Tyler digs creepy stuff, so he also thought it was cool.

That guy Bubba, the one who's especially outspoken about his racist views, as the night goes on, I put together that he's the one who gave John all his tattoos, the tattoos that John showed me abruptly at his workshop that cover his whole chest. Bubba, he explains that being a tattoo artist is a lot like being a therapist. People sit in his chair for hours on end, and each person he works on is getting that tattoo for some specific reason.

It's his job, as he sees it, to uncover that reason. Maybe it's a meditation, a milestone, an excuse to get out of the house, a new girlfriend, a death. John's motivation was especially bewildering to Bubba, because John had made it clear almost every time he came in the shop how deeply he despised tattoos.

BUBBA:
If you got a tattoo on you, he'd tell you you wasn't shit. You're a low life. You shouldn't have that on you.

BRIAN REED:
So as shocking as it was to me when John lifted up his shirt to show me all his tattoos, it was far more shocking to Bubba when John strolled in one day at the age of 47 and asked him to start putting them there.

BUBBA:
I thought he was going to commit suicide. You know, that's what I thought in my mind.

BRIAN REED:
Why?

BUBBA:
This is something you're completely against. You think fucking failures have tattoos, you know what I'm saying? Why in the fuck would you just start tattooing your whole upper body like that, you know what I mean? And around your neck—pistons. Tattooing pistons on him, you know? Redneck-ass tattoos, you know?

So I mean, first thought, I thought he was going to kill himself. I thought he was going to get tatted the fuck up and blow his brains out or something. Fuck, I don't know. And then the more I got to doing it, you know, I realized, you know, we're in a rut. You know, we need some money and he helped us out. I mean, he helped a lot.

BRIAN REED:
Bubba and Tyler co-own Black Sheep Ink together. And Bubba started noticing, they'd have a bill about to come due for the business, they'd be wondering how they were going to pay it, and then conveniently, John would come in and hand over $300 or $400 and ask for another tattoo on his chest. Bubba says people around here don't throw down money like that. But John would, just in the nick of time, and then schedule another appointment for soon after.

BUBBA:
He might not have said I'm helping you out, but when you sit down and pay me $2,000, $3,000 in a couple week span, you just helped me out. You know, you just got all my bills caught up. You just got everything back to where it needed to be, you know?

BRIAN REED:
You think that's why he did it?

BUBBA:
Now I do. He keeps a book, man. He writes down everything. So he knows when we're having a bad time. He'd ask certain things, like what's the rent, you know, what's your power bill, when's it due? And he already knows this shit, because he writes shit down. And he just planned his tattoo out to where it pretty much paid everything up in increments.

BRIAN REED:
Wait, it was like that exact almost?

BUBBA:
Yeah.

If it wasn't for John, we'd be shut the fuck down.

BRIAN REED:
If it wasn't for John?

BUBBA:
Yeah. If it weren't for John, I'd be tattooing at my kitchen table right now. And I think he sacrificed his skin to help us out.

BRIAN REED:
Bubba says John is an emotional guy, and sure, a lot of that emotion is disgust, but there's also sympathy, in particular for Tyler. If he's helping the tattoo parlor, he's only doing it because of Tyler and his brother, Jake.

BUBBA:
He's just watched them boys, man, and he knows how his daddy was. I mean, the kid was laying block at 5 years old.

BRIAN REED:
Tyler, that is.

BUBBA:
You know, on the job site working. Not going to school—working. Go to school two days a week, work five days a week, you know what I mean? So he just seen it and he knows it wasn't right, sees what—how Tyler's been programmed to be the way he is by his raising and his upbringing, you know, and feels sorry for him, I guess. I don't know. Or knows that he's smarter than what he's letting on. I mean, I don't know.

BRIAN REED:
That Tyler is?

BUBBA:
Yeah.

BRIAN REED:
When John hires Tyler to chop down trees in his yard or build iron gates in his crawlspaces, he doesn't really need that stuff done, Bubba says. He's just trying to find an excuse to put money in Tyler's pocket. When Tyler gets caught driving with a suspended license and ends up in jail, something that happens now and again, Bubba knows John's the one to call because he'll bail him out.

BUBBA:
He loves Tyler. I mean, Tyler's his boy. I mean, that's his boy. Tyler's brother, he cares about Tyler's little brother Jake, you know. John can say anything he wants to, but he loves Tyler probably just as much as you would your own son, your own flesh and blood. And I ain't figured it out.

BRIAN REED:
We're standing in the backyard as we're talking, behind the tattoo shop. A train whistle starts to blow in the distance. Eventually, someone comes out and tells me I might be interested to know that Kabrahm's sister, Kashion Burt, is here, like right inside, 15 feet away from me. Why don't we just go ask her about the murder?

This town. I go to the bar, leave $6 for my beer, and, careful to avoid Kabrahm's sister, head out the secret door, not knowing what I eventually will know months and months from now—that Kabrahm Burt didn't murder anybody, but also that before this is all over, someone will end up dead.

BUBBA:
You coming up here when you get off?

BRIAN REED:
More in a minute.

[AD]

BRIAN REED:
Kabrahm? Hey, I'm Brian Reed.

KABRAHM BURT:
Nice to meet you, Brian.

BRIAN REED:
So I'm doing a radio story. I'm a reporter. I'm here from New York. Is there somewhere quiet we could sit?

BRIAN REED:
It's a year later, and I'm pulling into K3 Lumber on a Friday morning, nervously asking if Kabrahm's around. I feel comfortable doing this only because I have finally determined that the incident John contacted me about, where Kabrahm allegedly got into a fight and beat a guy to death, although it did, in fact, go down almost exactly as John and Jake and Skyler and others told me, was wrong in one relatively important detail—the ""to death"" part. The guy Kabrahm beat up did not die. They just thought he did for a while. That's what I eventually gathered from talking to people more.

Once I heard that, I started contacting law enforcement to find out what did exactly happen. It turns out the incident in question actually took place in adjacent Tuscaloosa County. A chief at the sheriff's department there read to me from a detailed case file showing that the police had investigated the fight thoroughly, that no one had been killed, and that they had closed the case not because they were paid off or anything, but because none of the guys involved wanted to press charges. And so here I am at K3 Lumber to ask Kabrahm why he would go around bragging to people that he had killed a guy he had not killed. He's with some coworkers in the lumber yard in a plaid shirt, green trucker hat, and dark sunglasses.

BRIAN REED:
Kabrahm? Hey, I'm Brian Reed.

KABRAHM BURT:
Nice to meet you, Brian.

BRIAN REED:
There's a particular philosophy I've encountered down here, and will continue to encounter. That is the fuck-it philosophy, a belief that there's no sense in worrying or thinking too much about any given decision, because life is going to be difficult and unfair regardless of what you do. It's more than a belief, really. It's a way of moving moment to moment through the world. And from the get-go, Kabrahm seems to be a subscriber. I show up with a microphone and ask if I can talk to him on the record about a matter I've yet to name, and he's immediately game. Fuck it. And we walk over behind some stacks of lumber to be alone.

KABRAHM BURT:
What you want to talk about, Bud?

BRIAN REED:
So basically, were you at one point going around telling people that you'd killed someone?

KABRAHM BURT:
No. A boy cut my buddy's neck right here with a knife. But no. Like, I beat the piss out of him. What happened was—

BRIAN REED:
What happened was, Kabrahm says, they were at a party, and he doesn't know how the fight started because he and almost everyone else were zonked out of their minds.

KABRAHM BURT:
Drinking and doing everything else under the sun.

BRIAN REED:
Like substance-wise?

KABRAHM BURT:
Like taking Xanax, and mixing speed with it and stuff.

BRIAN REED:
According to the police report, it was a clear, moonlit night, about 4:00, 4:30 in the morning, on August 4, 2012, just a few days outside the time window John had discerned from his records. Kabrahm says all he remembers is they were in the middle of the woods, chilling around a fire. A fight broke out, and then suddenly, this dude Dylan—not Dylan Nichols, as John had told me—he was not involved—but another Dylan with a different last name, came up from behind with a knife and cut Kabrahm's buddy, Tim, in the neck. So Kabrahm went after him, held Dylan's head down, punched him, hit him with a beer bottle.

Tim got involved. He might have bit the guy in the cheek. Dylan kept swinging his knife the whole time. He stabbed Kabrahm, too

KABRAHM BURT:
Right up here.

BRIAN REED:
Up in your thigh, there.

KABRAHM BURT:
Yeah, like almost cut my gooch meat.

[LAUGHTER]

BRIAN REED:
And then it was over. Kabrahm thinks the whole thing lasted maybe 15 seconds. It wasn't some beautiful, drawn-out movie fight, he says. It was a real-life fight, which means it was scrappy, awkward, and quick, and left his friend Tim clutching a four-inch gash on his neck that was gushing blood.

BRIAN REED:
Did you think, like, Tim might be—like, it might be life-threatening?

KABRAHM BURT:
Yes. That is the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life.

BRIAN REED:
Kabrahm looked around and saw almost everyone at the party, maybe 30, 40 people, scattering. Tim was in a bad way, so someone had called 911, and now people were driving away or hiding in the woods before the police got there. The ambulance came, carted Kabrahm and Tim to the hospital, and after getting a few stitches near the meat of his gooch, Kabrahm went outside to smoke a cigarette and bumped into a group of random girls from the party.

KABRAHM BURT:
Telling me all kinds of crazy shit, like somebody had died. Like, oh, that boy you got in a fight with died.

BRIAN REED:
What did you think?

KABRAHM BURT:
I was thinking, I don't think that boy died. I said, you wouldn't think so. Hell, the fight didn't last that long.

BRIAN REED:
But still, you had, like, this part of your brain that was like, maybe.

KABRAHM BURT:
Well, yeah. I started coming down off them Xanaxes, you know, and you get to thinking like, oh God, I hope I didn't do something stupid. I don't think nobody died, but if they did, I ain't gonna hang around to find out.

BRIAN REED:
Kabrahm says he was kind of wigging out wondering if he killed someone. He called a buddy of his to come pick him up at the hospital. That buddy was in a motel room full of methheads in Bessemer, Kabrahm says, and judging from police records and other sources, it seems possible the rumor that Dylan had been killed started in that motel room, and then spread from there.

Kabrahm says by the time he got to work on Monday, it had already taken hold. People were coming up to him at the lumberyard and other places around town asking if he killed a guy.

BRIAN REED:
And so you never—I just want to ask you this again—you never maybe were drunk one time and saying, yeah, I beat that guy to death to anyone? Because I heard that you were bragging about it from multiple people.

KABRAHM BURT:
Number one, that wouldn't even be something to brag about. It ain't like a deer or something, you know?

BRIAN REED:
I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear you say that, I got to say. So where would people get that from?

KABRAHM BURT:
Just a damn small town, man. Shit gets fucking twisted.

BRIAN REED:
But saying that you told them directly to their face?

KABRAHM BURT:
Hell, I don't know, buddy.

BRIAN REED:
I don't know either. I can't tell if what Kabrahm is saying to my face right now is true or not. I spoke to Kabrahm's father, too, Kendall Burt, and told him that John said he'd overheard him on the phone here at K3 one day saying something about how his son was guilty as hell, and he knew it. And Kendall told me he doesn't know what John heard him say, or if he heard him say anything, but that he's a tough-love kind of guy, and that if his son had done something like killed a person, he would never cover that up.

According to Kabrahm, there is a moral to this story. He shares it with me after I wonder aloud to him about something one of the police officers told me. Why did his buddy Tim, rather than pressing charges against the man that almost killed him with a knife, decide instead to shove his middle finger in the face of the cops when they came to talk to him in his hospital bed?

KABRAHM BURT:
I mean, nobody wants to be a tattletale.

BRIAN REED:
I mean, dude almost died. He got stabbed in the neck.

BRIAN REED:
Kabrahm takes a drag of his cigarette.

BRIAN REED:
You're shrugging your shoulders.

KABRAHM BURT:
If he gonna live like white trash and shit, then hell, you might as well not tell on nobody, because, you know, if that's the life you're trying to live, you can't be mad when, you know—low-down, dirty shit like that happens when you hang out with low-down, dirty people.

BRIAN REED:
You there?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I'm here.

BRIAN REED:
Cool.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I'm waiting on tea to boil.

BRIAN REED:
Do you have time to talk? I have some stuff I'd love to talk to you about.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I'm sitting here—

BRIAN REED:
Are you busy?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
—right now at 2:25 with my orange pants on, waiting for Tyler to get his ass back over here. I figured you was calling to lower the boom or some damn stuff—go to town.

BRIAN REED:
Yeah, it's my turn to talk a lot. I have a lot to catch you up on, actually.

BRIAN REED:
I'm excited to tell John what I figured out, finally, after all this time. I now narrate the story of the real crime back to him, almost a year and a half after he first told me about it, with details colored in and facts illuminated, including the rather germane one that Kabrahm did not kill anybody. After I'm done, John summarizes my findings.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
A bunch of fussing and fighting, snaggletooth, stolen trucks, meth labs, stabbing, hooping, hollering, and going to jail? I can't believe how much you've worked on this son of a bitch, and at the same time—

[SIGH]

My God.

BRIAN REED:
What? Why the sigh?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I'm sitting here looking out the window at the clouds going by, just in loathing disgust at the town that I live in and the fact that I didn't pack my bags and get the hell out of here decades ago. I think it's the part about hiding in the woods that did it. That's just so classic Bibb County. I don't know how many times I've heard that expression in my life—""hiding in the woods."" I think hiding in the woods in Bibb County is like having your afternoon tea in London.

BRIAN REED:
You know, there is another way John could have responded to all this news. I dare call it the normal way. That sigh he let out, rather than being one of despair, could have been one of relief—relief that a young man has not been killed, that local officials have not been bought off by a powerful, rich family, and that, in fact, law enforcement has done what appears to be a competent job responding to this incident. Shittown, at least in this case, doesn't look so, so terrible to me.

BRIAN REED:
I don't know. Progress, right?

[LAUGHTER]

BRIAN REED:
But no. I've learned that sometimes you catch John in a spell of depression, sometimes you catch him in a bout of mania, and sometimes, like today, I think, you catch him in an alchemy of the two.

[SIGH]

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I'm trying to think of a snappy comeback to that.

BRIAN REED:
Because what is it, if not progress?

[LAUGHTER]

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Oh my God. Oh, Lord, it's just a clusterfuck of sorrow, isn't it?

BRIAN REED:
A clusterfuck of sorrow.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
It's kind of like progress as in ISIS is making progress. You know, it's that type of progress.

[LAUGHTER]

It's like ISIS, is all I can come up with. Oh, shit.

[LAUGHTER]

BRIAN REED:
Damn, man. I'm over here busting my ass off. When you contacted me, you wanted to know what actually happened. So it's progress in that sense, right?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
It's progress in that sense.

BRIAN REED:
I am not saving the world over here. Climate change is—

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
You are definitely not saving the world.

BRIAN REED:
No. Climate change—

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Not by a long shot.

BRIAN REED:
Climate change is not ending. I am not bringing jobs and sustainable employment to Alabama and lifting people out of poverty. But you asked me to try and figure out what happened here. On that front, I've made progress.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I think you've done pretty goddamn good.

BRIAN REED:
Well, thank you.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I guess if I sound like I'm disinterested today, it's firstly because I'm tired and wore-ass out. And secondly because, you know, I just—I'm not the most cheerful person. You know, I spend most spare time now either studying energy or climate change, and it's not looking good. So yes, sometimes it's hard for me to get focused back on something when the whole goddamned Arctic summer sea ice is going to be gone by 2017. And we're fixing to have heat waves in Siberia this year, and sometimes I feel like a total idiot because I'm worried about a goddamn crackhead out here in fucking Shittown, Alabama.

So yeah, that's just a personality disorder of mine. You know, sometimes when you call me, I'm kind of in an upbeat mood. And sometimes, like today, you caught me in one of these tired, somber, you know, reflective moods, where I've been, you know, sitting there mulling over climate change for about the past 10 damned hours. Oh, I mean, my God—

BRIAN REED:
When John says he's been mulling over climate change for the past 10 hours, what I think he means is that he's been mulling over climate change for the past 10 hours. I don't think he's exaggerating. It's like work for him, like he's made it his job.

We've now been talking to each other for a year and a half, and while some of that time we've discussed the murder, there's been so much other stuff John wants to chat about. It's interesting stuff, but it's all over the place. Even if I haven't talked to him in a while, nearly every day he sends me emails about all sorts of global calamities that he continues to keep up with, even though they've fallen out of the news.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
How many people are still concerned today about the Philippines?

BRIAN REED:
He's referring to Typhoon Haiyan from 2013. Or how about the tsunami in Sri Lanka in 2004, John says, or the terrible flood in Pakistan the year before last?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Not hearing a lot about that, are you?

BRIAN REED:
How about the fallout from the Ebola outbreak, or the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, or—a deeper cut—Chernobyl? The list goes on and on. And it's not just catastrophe. John also gives me lectures and sends reports on the systemic problems he sees leading to complete breakdown of the social contract—problems in our food production chain, our health care industry, our monetary policy.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
—all the fucking hedonic regression, geometric weighting.

BRIAN REED:
He also shares a variety of disturbing stories that he manages to dig up from all corners of the country, about the son of a US senator suffocating 21 dogs, or a KKK branch giving out bags of candy to children as a recruitment effort in South Carolina, or a guy down the street from John trying to kill his wife by running her over with a Bobcat.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I was on Homefacts last night. The city of West Blocton has outdone Vance as being the child molester per capita capital of Alabama.

BRIAN REED:
This is another data point John likes to send me now and again—the number of sex offenders per capita in his area. Vance and West Blocton are both towns in Bibb County.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Vance is now one child molester for every 192 citizens. West Blocton is for about over 63 or 4.

BRIAN REED:
Why do you check that statistic so often?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Why do I check crude oil plus lease condensate production so often, or why do I go pore over the tables from the IPCC so often?

BRIAN REED:
The IPCC being the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
—and I've tied down a couple other people—

BRIAN REED:
For the longest time, I thought the only connection between all of John's random interests was that it was all shitty. But the connection is deeper than that. He's distressed by the lack of outrage compared to the amount of shittiness in the world. To him, that ratio is totally out of whack.

That's why he was still upset about the Kabrahm rumor, even after I told him it wasn't true. Even though the murder and the cover-up weren't real, everyone sure did believe they were, and still they did nothing. That part, the inaction—that's more disturbing to John than the idea of the murder itself.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
You know, I really hate that these kids know all the things that they know, and they just accept them as normal.

BRIAN REED:
I know. That seems to really bother you, huh?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Accept it as something you can't do nothing about.

BRIAN REED:
The shitty misfortunes John fixates on, they're not a bunch of disparate things. They're all the same thing. His Shittown is part of Bibb County, which is part of Alabama, which is part of the United States, which is part of Earth, which is experiencing climate change, which no one is doing anything about. It maddens John. The whole world is giving a collective shrug of its shoulders and saying fuck it.

What I admire about John is that in his own misanthropic way, he's crusading against one of the most powerful, insidious forces we face—resignation, the numb acceptance that we can't change things. He's trying to shake people out of their stupor, trying to convince them that it is possible to make their world a better place.

Yes, that lady over there, she's barefoot and she's pantsless, but we can lend her shoes. We can give her some pants. Instead of just putting our heads down and speeding past her and muttering that she must have done something to get like that, we can ask her if she's in trouble, and we can offer her help. There is a different way.

That's why John rants and raves at the tattoo parlor. That's why John adopts dozens of stray dogs. That's why he devotes night after night to studying and writing about climate change. That's why he contacted a national radio show and asked me to come investigate. And that's why I now see John is devoting so much energy to what is arguably his most ambitious project of all—radically altering the life of Tyler Goodson.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Tyler almost embodies everything I hate about this Shittown in one convenient package. Have you ever thought of it that way? I bet you haven't dared.

BRIAN REED:
As the months have gone by since my trip to Alabama, I've heard more and more about Tyler. I've learned all about his tough childhood, the petty legal troubles that continue to dog him, his persistent financial problems, his struggle to support his three daughters, whom he had by the age of 21, and whom he loves dearly.

John has devoted his life to restoring old clocks. Methodically and thoroughly, he sorts through the busted parts of these timepieces, trying to revive a sense of beauty and order. And in a way, that's what he's attempting to do with Tyler. Every time John picks up the phone and I ask what he's up to, Tyler's either there or he was just there, or he's waiting for him to get there. It seems like he's giving him consistent work.

John's also been accompanying Tyler to court and hiring him a lawyer to help him clear up some misdemeanor charges and get his driver's license back. And Tyler's recently moved to the trailer park across the street from John, so now he can easily walk to John's place. John's even talking about writing Tyler and his brother Jake into his will.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I don't want these two bastards to know this, but when I fall over dead, each one is going to get 20 ounces of gold each.

BRIAN REED:
I'll keep that secret.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
That's assuming the goddamn cops don't come in and steal it.

BRIAN REED:
But John's relationship with Tyler is not just as a benefactor. I can tell that they get something more from one another. John will mention a walk he and Tyler took through the woods, or an expedition they made to the junkyard to search for treasures, or he'll recount some bit of their conversation. They like to spend time together.

One day, John was on the phone with me, and he looked out his window and started listing off the flowers that were in bloom in his yard, and the ones that were dying. He sighed and said,

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
It's tedious and brief. That's a sundial motto—tedious and brief.

BRIAN REED:
Before we had clocks, we had sundials, and I never thought about this until I started talking to John, but watching a sundial, which could be as simple as a stick in the ground, as the shadow crept along, you were actually witnessing the rotation of the Earth. It's so much less abstracted than a clock, a level closer to time itself. Anyway, John told me sundials often have mottos engraved on them. John says ""tedious and brief"" is one.

BRIAN REED:
What do you mean, ""tedious and brief?""

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Your life is tedious and brief. All sundial mottos are sad like that.

BRIAN REED:
There are hundreds of these mottos. ""Life passes like this shadow."" ""Make haste, but slowly."" ""Use the hours, don't count them."" ""Even as you watch, I'm fleeing."" ""Soon comes night.""

These little reminders are out there, hidden in crannies around the world. I recently happened upon a sundial in the cemetery of an old Catholic mission next to a grave. Because of John, I knew to look for the motto. It read, ""Nil boni hodie. Diem perdidi."" ""I did nothing good today. I have lost a day.""

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
You know, I told you, I used to make sundials, but I made them for the mathematical exercise. You know, I would pick difficult dials to do as a test of my abilities of geometry and trigonometry. And these are things I wish Tyler and Jake could experience. There's a real excitement in geometry and trigonometry that's just, you know—I think when we was building the swing—you know, I built a swing for Tyler—

BRIAN REED:
This is one of the ways John and Tyler have been passing the hours together lately. They've been constructing an adult swingset, a giant rectangular frame, to the side of John's house, not far from the apple trees, with a single John Deere tractor seat hanging from it. It has a 20-foot arc of action, John says, which I understand to mean it's a pretty gnarly swing. When John first told me about it, he'd said he was building it for himself. But now he amends that.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
I think I built a swing for Tyler, actually. I found out that an old man of 50, when he swings in a swing for about 20 minutes, his back hurts and his knees hurt, so I didn't build it for me after all. I done found that out. So I think I built it for Tyler. Fuck it.

Oh, and I built him a pull-up bar, because he wants to be strong. I told him, well, it's nice to be physically strong, but you need to be strong between the ears, because physical strength goes away. You know, you need to have strong neurons. And I told him, you need to have a little bit of general algebra. You should always have some trigonometry and you should have some geometry.

BRIAN REED:
What did he say?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
He never—I remember this conversation. He said he never saw how it is that had anything you could do much with.

BRIAN REED:
I like imagining this odd pair, a polymathic, middle-aged clock restorer and a tatted-up kid in his 20s with a Harley and a revolver in his briefcase, out in John's yard on a summer's day, staking swingset poles into the ground, the dogs circling around them, maybe a butterfly fluttering by. I like imagining John interrupting their work for a minute to give Tyler a math lesson, feeling gratified that he has someone to give a math lesson to, and Tyler perhaps taking something from it, but at the very least humoring John, because he's grateful that John's helping him get his life together. I like knowing that this is how two people have chosen to spend an afternoon together in Bibb County, Alabama. ""Take the gifts of this hour,"" one sundial says. Another, ""It's later than you think.""

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
And I point out the diagonal chain that was going to shore up the upright—

BRIAN REED:
Of the swing set?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Yeah. I told him that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the two sides. He hadn't used Pythagoras' theorem. So we could calculate the length of the chain without climbing up on the goddamn top of the pole and pulling it in diagonal with the tape measure. That was my answer.

BRIAN REED:
And what did he say?

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
""Mm,"" or something like that.

BRIAN REED:
Mm.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
Yeah. He has a lot of his daddy's mannerisms. ""Mm"" is often heard when there's not a significant answer. Hold on, hold on. I'm gonna piss in the sink. I hope that's politically incorrect. That's something that flips Tyler out. Yes, I just pissed in the kitchen sink, because—

BRIAN REED:
I can't—

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
If the phone had enough signal, I would just go out there and piss near one of the gardenias or the azaleas or the camellias or the crepe myrtles because, you know they like acid.

[BLOWING NOSE]

But I didn't think the phone had enough signal, so instead of wasting three or four gallons to flush the commode, I just peed here in the kitchen sink and used about 1 cupful of water to flush the sink. And I got a little short dick, but I got a pretty good aim, so I can usually aim right for the center of that damn thing without splashing everywhere.

[LAUGHTER]

BRIAN REED:
Oh, man.

JOHN B. McLEMORE:
But in any event—what was the question? I forgot.

BRIAN REED:
I forgot too.

[PHONE RINGING]

SKYLER:
Hello?

BRIAN REED:
Hey, is Jake around? Is this Skyler?

BRIAN REED:
It's been a couple weeks since I last spoke to John, and I just got a text from Jake, Tyler's brother, asking me to call him when I get a chance.

SKYLER:
Yeah, this is Skyler. I was the one that called you. Jake texted you for me.

BRIAN REED:
Oh, hey.

SKYLER:
Has any—hold on just one second. Has anybody called you?

BRIAN REED:
No, not that I know of. I have a few missed calls, but I don't think they're from anybody down there.

SKYLER:
Oh.

BRIAN REED:
Why?

SKYLER:
Well, we have some bad news to tell you.

BRIAN REED:
OK.

SKYLER:
John B. killed himself Monday night.

Angels FallBreaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
I tried to face the fight within
But it's over
I'm ready for the riot to begin
And surrender
I walked the path that led me to the end
Remember
I'm caught beneath, there's nothing left to give
Forever

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

[Verse 2]
Gray skies will chase the light away
No longer
I fought the fight, now only dark remains
Forever
Divided I will stand
And I will let this end

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

[Bridge]
The sun begins to rise
And wash away the sky
The turning of the tide
Don't leave it all behind
And I will never say goodbye

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever"
FailureBreaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
Life will come our way, it has only just begun
The world will die alone, the frail will fall below
Time will take our place, we return it back to one
The calm before the cold, the long and lonely road

[Pre-Chorus]
Look for the light that leads me home

[Chorus 1]
Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Failure

[Verse 2]
Drive the cloud away, we will fall from last to none
The dark before the dawn, the world will carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
Look for the light that leads me home

[Chorus 2]
Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Tired of wasted breath, tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Failure

[Instrumental + Bridge]
Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Tired of wasted breath, tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down

[Outro]
We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight
Failure, failure
We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight
Failure, failure

Failure"
Dead InsideMuse,"[Intro]
Dead inside

[Verse 1: Matt Bellamy]
Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me, babe
Do you have no soul?
It's like it died, long ago

[Chorus]
Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft

[Chorus]
Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

[Bridge]
Feel me now, hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me, stop hiding from me
It's hurting, babe
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything, I can't give you any more
Now I've become just like you

[Outro]
My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside"

I could be a dancer, maybe
I could be a judge, used to
Sing that karaoke but I
I don’t do it much

Americans are livin’ the simple life

I've been working on my knees, baby; it's alright
Everybody got disease, maybe it's alright
You can steal from me, baby; that's just fine
You can say it's free, baby; that's alright

[Pre-Chorus: Angela Mattson & Jeffrey Mendel]
Working on a feeling, breaking down the ceiling, digging up a deep end
Freezing on the beaches, reaching for the sweetest, sweetest peaches

[Chorus: Angela Mattson & Jeffrey Mendel]
We won't live too long
So let's love for one song
The lion won't lay down
When the holy man's in town

[Verse 2: Jeffrey Mendel, Angela Mattson]
You've been drinking all week, baby; that's alright
You've been stepping on me, baby; it's alright
You've been tearing me apart in the dead of night
I'll be raising my hands when the lightning strikes

[Pre-Chorus: Angela Mattson & Jeffrey Mendel]
Working on a feeling, breaking down the ceiling, digging up a deep end
Freezing on the beaches, reaching for the sweetest, sweetest peaches

[Chorus: Angela Mattson & Jeffrey Mendel]
We won't live too long
So let's love for one song
The lion won't lay down

Ship To WreckFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
Dredging up great white sharks, swimming in the bed
And here comes a killer whale, to sing me to sleep
Thrashing the covers off, has me by its teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

[Verse 2]
What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
And don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
The chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

[Bridge]
Good God, under starless skies
We are lost, and into the breach, we got tossed
And the water's coming in fast

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?"

A Memoir of a Childhood

By Frank McCourt

This book is dedicated to my brothers, Malachy, Michael, Alphonsus. I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.

Acknowledgments

This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.
R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.
Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.
Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third
and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.
And Molly was right.
My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.
My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final
page.
I am blessed among men.


I
My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.
When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.
People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.
Above all-we were wet.
Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.
It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.
From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.
The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.
Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the
rain.
My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County
Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.
When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.
Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.
After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.
My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.
After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?
Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.
He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles
a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.
Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.
She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.
Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.
My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.
My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.
St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.
Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.
And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.
Love her as in childhood
Though feeble, old and grey.
For you'll never miss a mother's love
Till she's buried beneath the clay.
At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.
She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.
With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.
A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.
That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.
Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.
Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.
Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.
Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.
Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.
Delia said, You shuddup.
Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Och, I am, said Malachy. I am.
Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.
And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.
Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little
talk.
Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.
Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than
you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.
Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd
manner.
Malachy smiled. I do?
about
You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.
'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.
Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry
that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.
Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.
There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.
Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.
Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.
He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.
On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.
Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.
There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.
After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.
Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.
At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say
that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.
If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?
I am, Philomena.
A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.
The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.
Their husbands agreed.
I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.
Up, down, up, down.
Malachy goes up.
I get off.
Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is
on his mouth and there's blood.
Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.
And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly
slows her.
She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?
In the middle of the day?
She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.
My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside
the child?
did.
our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a
dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.
Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.
I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the
dog.
Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All
the same blood.
Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She
tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.
Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.
Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?
It was his time, Francis.
The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother
shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other
room.
My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white
enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.
Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?
Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story
when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.
I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a
different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?
Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.
That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.
He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.
For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.
Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.
In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.
I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.
When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.
She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.
I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.
I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam
says,
They get their appetites because they're starving half the time.
When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be and the reason is this
Could it be true, someone like you
Could love me, love me?
When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is
say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.
All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.
Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.
But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,
From neither of them shall I part.
For one is my mother,
God bless her and love her,
The other is my sweetheart.
Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.
When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.
When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?
Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?
Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.
He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.
Deep in Canadian woods we met
From one bright island flown.
Great is the land we tread, but yet
Our hearts are with our own.
Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.
Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
isn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she
I want them up, he says. I want them
be free from the center to the sea.
Don't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.
a penny in your pocket without
says.
ready for the day Ireland will
do it'll be a sorry day in
He pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?
Mam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.
On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.
Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?
He puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he
says.
Later in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram
and off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She tells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains.
We come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, lady, but if we did that we'd have half the wives in Brooklyn storming the place. Lotta men have the drinking problem but there's nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work.
We wait across the street. Mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall. She gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but Malachy and I have to wait till she gets money from Dad and we can go to the Italian for tea and bread and eggs.
When the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate, their faces and hands black from the work. Mam tells us watch carefully for Dad because she can hardly see across the street
herself, her eyes are that bad. There are dozens of men, then a few, then none. Mam is crying, Why couldn't ye see him? Are ye blind or what?
She goes back to the man in the box. Are you sure there wouldn't be one man left inside?
No, lady, he says. They're out. I don't know how he got past you.
We go back through the long streets of Brooklyn. The twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar. Malachy says he's hungry and Mam tells him wait a little, we'll get money from Dad and we'll all have a nice supper. We'll go to the Italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and we'll have jam on it. Oh, we will, and we'll all be nice and warm.
It's dark on Atlantic Avenue and all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station are bright and noisy. We go from bar to bar looking for Dad. Mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me. There are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of Dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him.
The man behind the bar says, Yeah, sonny, whaddya want? You're not supposeta be in here, y'know.
I'm looking for my father. Is my father here?
Naw, sonny, how'd I know dat? Who's your fawdah?
His name is Malachy and he sings Kevin Barry.
Malarkey?
No, Malachy.
Malachy? And he sings Kevin Barry?
He calls out to the men in the bar, Youse guys, youse know guy
Malachy what sings Kevin Barry?
Men shake their heads. One says he knew a guy Michael sang Kevin
Barry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds. The barman says, Jeez, Pete, I didn't ax ya to tell me history o'
da woild, did I? Naw, kid. We don't let people sing in here. Causes trouble. Specially the Irish. Let 'em sing, next the fists are flying. Besides, I never hoid a name like dat Malachy. Naw, kid, no Malachy here.
The man called Pete holds his glass toward me. Here, kid, have a sip, but the barman says, Whaddya doin', Pete? Tryina get the kid drunk? Do that again, Pete, an' I'll come out an' break y'ass.
Mam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up. She leans against a wall and cries. Jesus, we still have to walk all the way to Classon Avenue and I have four starving children. She sends me back into the bar where Pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins' bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each. The men in the bar think it's very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but he's big and he tells them shut their lip. He tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when I tell him Mam doesn't have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk. He says, Tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an' bones. Ya drink water an' sugar an' all ya get is rickets. Tell ya Mom.
Mam is happy with the milk. She says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars can't be choosers.
When we reach Classon Avenue she goes straight to the Italian grocery shop. She tells the man her husband is late tonight, that he's probably working overtime, and would it be at all possible to get a few things and she'll be sure to see him tomorrow?
The Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store.
Oh, she says, I don't want much.
Anything you like, missus, because I know you're an honest woman and you got a bunch o' nice kids there.
We have eggs and toast and jam though we're so weary walking the long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew. The twins fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps her wash the twins' bottoms though he's ready to fall asleep himself.
I crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want to get up and tell her I'll be a man soon and I'll get a job in the place with the big gate and I'll come home every Friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss.
The next week Dad loses the job. He comes home that Friday night, throws his wages on the table and says to Mam, Are you happy now? You hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me. They were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them.
He takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out. He comes home late roaring and singing. The twins cry and Mam shushes them and cries a long time herself.
We spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping, when Mam is tired, and when Dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him, roaring about Kevin Barry getting hanged on a Monday morning or the Roddy McCorley song, Up the narrow street he stepped Smiling and proud and young About the hemp rope on his neck The golden ringlets clung, There's never a tear in the blue eyes Both glad and bright are they, As Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge of Toome today.
When he sings he marches around the table, Mam cries and the twins howl with her. She says, Go out, Frankie, go out, Malachy. You shouldn't see your father like this. Stay in the playground. We don't mind going to the playground.
We can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to Classon Avenue and the swings are frozen and won't even move. Minnie MacAdorey says, God help these poor wee boys.
They don't have a glove between them. That makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly. Malachy doesn't know what I'm laughing at: He won't know anything till he's four going on five.
Minnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it. Mr. MacAdorey sits in an armchair with their new baby, Maisie. He holds her bottle and sings, Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, With buns in his pocket For Maisie alone.
Clap hands, clap hands,
Till Daddy comes home,
For Daddy has money
And Mammy has none.
Malachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it's Maisie's song. He starts to cry and Minnie says, There, there. You can sing the
song.
and I
song.
That's a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone else's
Minnie says, Don't frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God it's dark enough. Some day you'll have a little sister and you can
knows
sing that song to her. Och, aye. You'll have a little sister, surely.
Minnie is right and Mam gets her wish. There's a new baby soon, a little girl, and they call her Margaret. We all love Margaret. She has black curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along Classon Avenue. Minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made. Mrs. Leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes, such a smile, such happiness. She makes me dance, says Mrs. Leibowitz.
sings
When Dad comes home from looking for a job he holds Margaret and to her: In a shady nook one moonlit night A leprechaun I spied.
With scarlet cap and coat of green
A cruiskeen by his side.
'Twas tick tock tick his hammer went Upon a tiny shoe.
Oh, I laugh to think he was caught at last, But the fairy was laughing, too.
He walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her. He tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother. He tells her he'll take her to Ireland and they'll walk the Glens of Antrim and swim in Lough Neagh. He'll get a job soon, so he will, and she'll have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles.
The more Dad sings to Margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh. Mam says, Look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms, him with his two left feet. She laughs and we all laugh.
The twins cried when they were small and Dad and Mam would say Whisht and Hush and feed them and they'd go back to sleep. But when Margaret cries there's a high lonely feeling in the air and Dad is out of bed in a second, holding her to him, doing a slow dance around the table, singing to her, making sounds like a mother. When he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and that's strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the Kevin Barry song and the Roddy McCorley song. Now he cries over Margaret and he has no smell of drink on him.
Mam tells Minnie MacAdorey, He's in heaven over that child. He hasn't touched a drop since she was born. I should've had a little girl a long time ago.
Och, they're lovely, aren't they? says Minnie. The little boys are grand, too, but you need a little girl for yourself.
My mother laughs, For myself? Lord above, if I didn't nurse her I wouldn't be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night.
Minnie says it's lovely, all the same, to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isn't everyone charmed with her?
Everyone.
The twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time. Their bottoms are sore because they're always wet and shitty. They put dirty things in their mouths, bits of paper, feathers, shoelaces, and they get sick. Mam says we're all driving her crazy. She dresses the twins, puts them in the pram, and Malachy and I take them to the playground. The cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down Classon Avenue.
We race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till they're hungry again and they cry so hard I don't know what to do because they're so small and I wish I could give them all kinds of food so that they'd laugh and make the baby sounds. They love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody.
If I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking Margaret. We are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing on the swings with Freddie Leibowitz. Malachy is trying to tell Freddie all about the way Setanta became Cuchulain. I tell him stop telling that story, it's my story. He won't stop. I push him and he cries, Waah, waah, I'll tell Mam. Freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and I run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells, Hey, stop, stop, and I won't because I can't, I don't know how, and if I stop Malachy will go on taking my story from me. Freddie pushes me away and runs off, yelling, Frankie tried to kill me. Frankie tried to kill me. I don't know what to do because I never tried to kill anyone before and now Malachy, on the swing, cries, Don't kill me, Frankie, and he looks so helpless I put my arms around him and help him off the swing. He hugs me. I won't tell your story anymore. I won't tell Freddie about Coo, Coo. I want to laugh but I can't because the twins are crying in the pram and it's dark in the playground and what's the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they can't see you in the dark?
The Italian grocery shop is across the street and I see bananas, apples, oranges. I know the twins can eat bananas. Malachy loves bananas and I like them myself. But you need money, Italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the McCourts who owe them money already for groceries.
My mother tells me all the time, Never, never leave that playground except to come home. But what am I to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram? I tell Malachy I'll be back in a minute. I make sure no one is looking, grab a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and run down Myrtle Avenue, away from the playground, around the block and back to the other end where there's a hole in the fence. We push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins. There are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner. The twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces, their hair, their clothes. I realize then that questions will be asked. Mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas, where did you get them? I can't tell her about the Italian shop on the corner. I will have to say, A man.
That's what I'll say. A man.
Then the strange thing happens. There's a man at the gate of the playground. He's calling me. Oh, God, it's the Italian. Hey, sonny, come 'ere. Hey, talkin' to ya. Come 'ere.
I go to him.
You the kid wid the little bruddas, right? Twins?
Yes, sir.
Heah. Gotta bag o' fruit. I don' give it to you I trow id out.
Right? So, heah, take the bag. Ya got apples, oranges, bananas. Ya like bananas, right? I think ya like bananas, eh? Ha, ha. I know ya like the bananas. Heah, take the bag. Ya gotta nice mother there. Ya father? Well, ya know, he's got the problem, the Irish thing. Give them twins a banana. Shud 'em up. I hear 'em all the way cross the street.
Thank you, sir.
Jeez. Polite kid, eh? Where ja loin dat?
My father told me to say thanks, sir.
Your father? Oh, well.
Dad sits at the table reading the paper. He says that President
Roosevelt is a good man and everyone in America will soon have a job. Mam is on the other side of the table feeding Margaret with a bottle. She has the hard look that frightens me.
Where did you get that fruit?
The man.
What man?
The Italian man gave it to me.
Did you steal that fruit?
Malachy says, The man. The man
And what did you do to Freddie
Lovely woman. I don't know what we'd
And you had to attack poor Freddie.
gave Frankie the bag.
Leibowitz? His mother was here.
do without her and Minnie MacAdorey.
Malachy jumps up and down. He din't. He din't. Din't try to kill Freddie. Din't try to kill me.
Dad says, Whisht, Malachy, whisht. Come over here. And he takes Malachy on his lap.
My mother says, Go down the hall and tell Freddie you're sorry.
But Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you're sorry?
I don't.
My parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy. He
was only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn't that right? He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story.
Och, now. Freddie doesn't care about the Cuchulain story. He has
his own story. Hundreds of stories. He's Jewish. What's Jewish?
Dad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories. They don't need Cuchulain. They have Moses. They have Samson.
What's Samson?
If you go down and talk to Freddie I'll tell you about Samson later. You can tell Freddie you're sorry and you'll never do it again and you can even ask him about Samson. Anything you like as long as you talk to Freddie. Will you?
The baby gives a little cry in my mother's arms and Dad jumps up, dropping Malachy to the floor. Is she all right? My mother says, Of course she's all right. She's feeding. God above, you're a bundle of nerves.
They're talking about Margaret now and I'm forgotten. I don't care. I'm going down the hall to ask Freddie about Samson, to see if Samson is as good as Cuchulain, to see if Freddie has his own story or if he still wants to steal Cuchulain. Malachy wants to go with me now that my father is standing and doesn't have a lap anymore.
Mrs. Leibowitz says, Oh, Frankie, Frankie, come in, come in. And little Malachy. And tell me, Frankie, what did you do to Freddie? Tried to kill him? Freddie is a good boy, Frankie. Reads his book. Listens to radio with his papa. He swinks you brother on swink. And you try to kill him. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. And you poor mother and her sick baby.
She's not sick, Mrs. Leibowitz.
Sick she is. Zat is one sick baby. I know from sick babies. I work in hoztipal. Don't tell me, Frankie. Come in, come in. Freddie, Freddie, Frankie is here. Come out. Frankie won't kill you no more. You and little Malachy. Nice Chewish name, have piece cake, eh? Why they give you a Chewish name, eh? So, glass milk, piece cake. You boys so thin, Irish don't eat.
We sit at the table with Freddie, eating cake, drinking milk. Mr. Leibowitz sits in an armchair reading the paper, listening to the radio. Sometimes he speaks to Mrs. Leibowitz and I don't understand because strange sounds come from his mouth. Freddie understands. When Mr. Leibowitz makes the strange sounds Freddie gets up and takes him a piece of cake. Mr. Leibowitz smiles at Freddie and pats his head and Freddie smiles back and makes the strange sounds.
Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head at Malachy and me. Oy, so thin. She says Oy so much Malachy laughs and says Oy and the Leibowitzes laugh and Mr. Leibowitz says words we can understand, When Irish oyes are smiling. Mrs. Leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and Malachy says Oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh. I say Oy but no one laughs and I know Oy belongs to Malachy the way Cuchulain belongs to me and Malachy can have his Oy.
Mrs. Leibowitz, my father said Freddie has a favorite story.
Malachy says, Sam, Sam, Oy. Everyone laughs again but I don't because I can't remember what comes after Sam. Freddie mumbles through his cake, Samson, and Mrs. Leibowitz tells him, Don't talk wiz you mouse full, and I laugh because she's grown-up and she says mouse instead of mouth. Malachy laughs because I laugh and the Leibowitzes look at each other and smile. Freddie says, Not Samson. My favorite story is David and the giant, Goliath. David killed him dead with a slingshot, a stone in his head. His brains was on the ground.
Were on the ground, says Mr. Leibowitz.
Yes, Papa. Papa.
That's what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my
father.
My mother's whisper wakes me. What's up with the child? It's still
early and there isn't much morning in the room but you can see Dad over by the window with Margaret in his arms. He's rocking her and sighing,
Och.
Mam says, Is she, is she sick?
Och, she's very quiet and she's a wee bit cold.
My mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor.
Go for God's sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day.
We wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water. Mam rocks in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my own little love. Open your lovely blue eyes, my little leanv.
I fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails, Water for you and your brother. Oh, indeed, Water, is it? And nothing for your sister. Your poor little sister. Did you ask if she had a mouth in her head? Did you ask if she'd like a drop of water? Oh, no. Go on and drink your water, you and your brother, as if nothing happened. A regular day for the two of you, isn't it? And the twins sleeping away as if they didn't have a care and their poor little sister sick here in my arms. Sick in my arms. Oh, sweet Jesus in heaven.
Why is she talking like this? She's not talking like my mother today. I want my father. Where is my father?
I get back into bed and start to cry. Malachy says, Why you cry? Why you cry? till Mam is at me again. Your sister is sick in my arms and you're there whining and whinging. If I go over to that bed I'll give you something to whinge about.
Dad is back with the doctor. Dad has the whiskey smell. The doctor examines the baby, prods her, raises her eyelids, feels her neck, arms, legs. He straightens up and shakes his head. She's gone. Mam reaches for the baby, hugs her, turns to the wall. The doctor wants to know, Was there any kind of accident? Did anyone drop the baby? Did the boys play too hard with her? Anything?
My father shakes his head. Doctor says he'll have to take her to examine her and Dad signs a paper. My mother begs for another few minutes with her baby but the doctor says he doesn't have all day. When Dad reaches for Margaret my mother pulls away against the wall. She has the wild look, her black curly hair is damp on her forehead and there is sweat all over her face, her eyes are wide open and her face is shiny with tears, she keeps shaking her head and moaning, Ah, no, ah, no, till Dad eases the baby from her arms. The doctor wraps Margaret completely in a blanket and my mother cries, Oh, Jesus, you'll smother her. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me. The doctor leaves. My mother turns to the wall and doesn't make a move or sound. The twins are awake, crying with the hunger, but Dad stands in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling. His face is white and he beats on his thighs with his fists. He comes to the bed, puts his hand on my head. His hand is shaking. Francis, I'm going out for cigarettes.
Mam stays in the bed all day, hardly moving. Malachy and I fill the twins' bottles with water and sugar. In the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages. We can't have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you can't drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while he's telling you about Cuchulain.
The twins are hungry again but I know I can't give them water and sugar all day and night. I boil sour milk in a pot, mash in some of the stale bread, and try to feed them from a cup, bread and goody. They make faces and run to Mam's bed, crying. She keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me, still crying. They won't eat the bread and goody till I kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar. Now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces. Malachy wants some and if he can eat it, so can I. We all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the
cold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox.
After we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we can't get in because Mrs. Leibowitz is inside, humming and singing. She says, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Won't be two seconds. Malachy claps his hands and dances around, singing, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Mrs. Leibowitz opens the lavatory door. Look at him. Little actor awready. So, chiltren, how's you mother?
She's in bed, Mrs. Leibowitz. The doctor took Margaret and my father went for cigarettes.
Oh, Frankie, Frankie. I said that was one sick child.
Malachy is clutching himself. Have to pee. Have to pee.
So, pee awready. You boys pee and we see you mother.
After we pee Mrs. Leibowitz comes to see Mam. Oh, Mrs. McCourt. Oy
vey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor woman. Here turn around, missus. Talk to me. Oy, this is one mess. Talk to me, Mrs. McCourt.
She helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. Mrs. Leibowitz says she'll bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mother's face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. Oh, Jesus. She won't let my hand go and I'm frightened because I've never seen her like this before. She's saying Frankie only because it's my hand she's holding and it's Margaret she's thinking about, not me. Your lovely little sister is dead, Frankie. Dead. And where is your father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. That's where he is. There isn't a penny in the house. He can't get a job but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the wall and screams, Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I'll go mad, so I will, I'll go pure mad.
Mrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. Where is she?
My mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night, Mrs. Leibowitz. In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night, alone, Mrs. Leibowitz, all alone in that pram.
Mrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush. Babies go like that. It happens, missus. God takes them.
In the pram, Mrs. Leibowitz. Near my bed. I could have picked her up and she didn't have to die, did she? God doesn't want little babies. What is God going to do with little babies?
I don't know, missus. I don't know from God. Have soup. Good soup. Make you strong. You boys. Get bowls. I give you soup.
What's bowls, Mrs. Leibowitz?
Oh, Frankie. You don't know bowl? For the soup, darlink. You don' have a bowl? So get cups for the soup. I mix pea soup and lentil soup. No ham. Irish like the ham. No ham, Frankie. Drink, missus. Drink you soup.
She spoons the soup into my mother's mouth, wipes the dribble from her chin. Malachy and I sit on the floor drinking from mugs. We spoon the soup into the twins' mouths. It is lovely and hot and tasty. My mother never makes soup like this and I wonder if there's any chance Mrs.
Leibowitz could ever be my mother. Freddie could be me and have my mother and my father, too, and he could have Malachy and the twins for brothers. He can't have Margaret anymore because she's like the dog in the street that was taken away. I don't know why she was taken away. My mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away.
I wish little Margaret could be here for the soup. I could give it to her with a spoon the way Mrs. Leibowitz is giving it to my mother and she'd gurgle and laugh the way she did with Dad. She wouldn't cry anymore and my mother wouldn't be in the bed day and night and Dad would be telling me Cuchulain stories and I wouldn't want Mrs. Leibowitz to be my mother anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz is nice but I'd rather have my father telling me Cuchulain stories and Margaret chirping and Mam laughing when Dad dances with two left feet.
Minnie MacAdorey comes in to help. Mother o' God, Mrs. Leibowitz, these twins smell to the high heavens.
I don't know about Mother o' God, Minnie, but these twins need a wash. They need clean diapers. Frankie, where are the clean diapers?
I don't know.
Minnie says, They're just wearing rags for diapers. I'll get some of Maisie's. Frankie, you take off those rags and throw them out.
Malachy removes Oliver's rag and I struggle with Eugene. The safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose, sticks him in the hip, and starts him screaming for Mam. But Minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water. I help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins' raw sore skin. She says they're good little boys and she has a big surprise for them. She goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us. There is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and I wonder if there's any chance Minnie could be my mother so that I could eat like this all the time. If I could have Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie for mothers at the same time I'd have no end of soup and mashed potatoes.
Minnie and Mrs. Leibowitz sit at the table. Mrs. Leibowitz says something has to be done. These children are running wild and where is the father? I hear Minnie whisper he's out for the drink. Mrs. Leibowitz says terrible, terrible, the way the Irish drink. Minnie says her Dan doesn't drink. Never touches the stuff and Dan told her that when the baby died that poor man, Malachy McCourt, went mad all over Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, that he was thrown out of all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station, that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby.
Here he has four lovely little boys, says Minnie, but it's no comfort to him. That little girl brought out something in him. You know he didn't even drink after she was born and that was a miracle.
Mrs. Leibowitz wants to know where Mam's cousins are, the big women with the quiet husbands. Minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected, running wild, sore arses and everything.
Two days later Dad returns from his cigarette hunt. It's the middle of the night but he gets Malachy and me out of the bed. He has the smell of the drink on him. He has us stand at attention in the kitchen. We are soldiers. He tells us we must promise to die for Ireland.
We will, Dad, we will.
All together we sing Kevin Barry,
On Mountjoy one Monday morning,
High upon the gallows tree,
Kevin Barry gave his young life
For the cause of liberty.
Just a lad of eighteen summers
Sure there's no one can deny
As he marched to death that morning
How he held his head on high.
There's a knock at the door, Mr. MacAdorey. Och, Malachy, for God's sake, it's three in the morning. You have the whole house woke with the singing.
Och, Dan, I'm only teaching the boys to die for Ireland.
You can teach them to die for Ireland in the daytime, Malachy. 'Tis urgent, Dan, 'tis urgent.
I know, Malachy, but they're only children. Babies. You go to bed
now like a dacent man.
Bed, Dan! What am I to do in bed? Her little face is there day and
night, her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes. Oh, Jesus, Dan, what will I do? Was it the hunger that killed her, Dan?
Of course not. Your missus was nursing her. God took her. He has his reasons.
One more song, Dan, before we go to bed. Good night, Malachy.
Come on, boys. Sing.
Because he loved the motherland, Because he loved the green
He goes to meet a martyr's fate With proud and joyous mien;
True to the last, oh! true to the last He treads the upward way;
Young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge at Toome today.
You'll die for Ireland, won't you, boys?
We will, Dad.
And we'll all meet your little sister in heaven, won't we, boys? We will, Dad.
My brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the
table and he's asleep. Dad lifts him, staggers across the room, places him in the bed by my mother. I climb into bed and my father, still in his clothes, lies beside me. I'm hoping he'll put his arms around me but he goes on singing about Roddy McCorley and talking to Margaret, Oh, my little curly-haired, blue-eyed love, I would dress you in silks and take you to Lough Neagh, till day is at the window and I fall asleep.
That night Cuchulain comes to me. There's a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley and I don't like that bird because there's blood dripping from his mouth when he sings. In one hand Cuchulain carries the gae bolga, the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it. In the other hand he carries a banana, which he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits blood at
him. You'd wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I think I'd hit them on the head with it.
In the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from England for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain's blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and Englishmen.
Most of the day Mam lies in bed with her face to the wall. If she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and I have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall. Mrs. Leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted. Mam tries to slice it but Mrs. Leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull. Malachy calls it pull bread but Mrs. Leibowitz says, No, it's challah, and teaches us how to say it. She shakes her head. Oy, you Irish. You'll live forever but you'll never say challah like a Chew.
Minnie MacAdorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat. Och, times are hard, Angela, but that lovely man, Mr. Roosevelt, will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work. Poor man, it's not his fault there's a Depression. He looks for work day and night. My Dan is lucky, four years with the city and he don't drink. He grew up in Toome with your husband. Some drink. Some don't. Curse of the Irish. Now eat, Angela. Build yourself up after your loss.
Mr. MacAdorey tells Dad there's work with the WPA and when he gets the work there's money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us. When Dad comes home with the drink smell there's no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland. Why doesn't he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died? Why doesn't he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry Mam's tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for Ireland but they can't even talk and Mam screamed at him, You mad oul' bastard, can't you leave the children alone?
He'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.
We get soup from Mrs. Leibowitz and mashed potatoes from Minnie MacAdorey and they show us how to take care of the twins, how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty. Mrs. Leibowitz calls them diapers and Minnie calls them nappies but it doesn't matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway. If Mam stays in the bed and Dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day. We can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry. The Italian man calls to me from across the street, Hey, Frankie, c'mere. Watch out crossing da street. Dem twins hungry again? He gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but I can't eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at Cuchulain.
The man says his name is Mr. Dimino and that's his wife, Angela, behind the counter. I tell him that's my mother's name. No kiddin', kid. Your mother is Angela? I didn't know the Irish had any Angelas. Hey, Angela, his mother's name is Angela. She smiles. She says, Thatsa nice.
Mr. Dimino asks me about Mam and Dad and who cooks for us. I tell him we get food from Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. I tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs. Angela, you listenin' to this? Thank God you're Italian, Angela. He says, Kid, I gotta talk to Mrs. Leibowitz. Ya gotta have relations can take care of you. Ya see Minnie MacAdorey, tell her come in see me. You kids runnin' wild.
Two big women are at the door. They say, Who are you? I'm Frank. Frank! How old are you?
I'm four going on five.
You're not very big for your age, are you?
I don't know.
Is your mother here?
She's in the bed.
What is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the
day?
She's sleeping. Well, we'll come in. We have to talk to your
mother.
They brush past me into the room. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the smell
of this place. And who are these children?
Malachy runs smiling to the big women. When he smiles you can see
how white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes, the pink of his cheeks. All that makes the big women smile and I wonder why they didn't smile when they talked to me.
Malachy says, I'm Malachy and this is Oliver and this is Eugene, they're twins, and that's Frankie over there.
The big woman with the brown hair says, Well, you're not a bit shy, are you? I'm your mother's cousin, Philomena, and this is your mother's cousin, Delia. I'm Mrs. Flynn and she's Mrs. Fortune and that's what you call us.
Good God, says Philomena. Those twins are naked. Don't you have clothes for them?
Malachy says, They're all shitty.
Delia barks. See. That's what happens. A mouth like a sewer, and no wonder with a father from the North. Don't use that word. That's a bad word, a curse word. You could go to hell using a word like that.
What's hell? says Malachy. You'll know soon enough, says Delia.
The big women sit at the table with Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. Philomena says it's terrible what happened to Angela's little baby. They heard all about it and you'd wonder, wouldn't you, what they did with the little body. You might wonder and I might wonder but Tommy Flynn didn't wonder. Tommy said that Malachy from the North got money for that baby. Money? says Mrs. Leibowitz. That's right, says Philomena. Money. They take bodies any age and do experiments on them and there's not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they can't be buried in consecrated ground in that condition.
That's terrible, says Mrs. Leibowitz. A father or mother would never give the baby for something like that.
They would, says Delia, when they have the craving for the drink. They'd give their own mothers when they have the craving so what's a baby that's dead and gone in the first place?
Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair. Oy, she says, oy, oy, oy. The poor baby. The poor mother. I thank God my husband don'have no what you call it? Craving? Right, craving. It's the Irish have the craving.
Not my husband, says Philomena. I'd break his face if he came home with the craving. Of course, Delia's Jimmy has the craving. Every Friday night you see him slipping into the saloon.
You needn't start insulting my Jimmy, says Delia. He works. He brings home his wages.
You'd want to keep an eye on him, says Philomena. The craving could get the better of him and you'd have another Malachy from the North on your hands.
Mind your own bloody business, says Delia. At least Jimmy is Irish, not born in Brooklyn like your Tommy.
And Philomena has no answer for that.
Minnie is holding her baby and the big women say she's a lovely baby, clean, not like this pack of Angela's running around this place. Philomena says she doesn't know where Angela got her dirty habits because Angela's mother was spotless, so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor.
I wonder why you'd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair.
Delia says something has to be done about Angela and these children for they are a disgrace, so they are, enough to make you ashamed to be related. A letter has to be written to Angela's mother. Philomena will write it because a teacher in Limerick told her once she had a fine fist. Delia has to tell Mrs. Leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting.
Mrs. Leibowitz goes down the hall to borrow her husband's fountain pen, paper and an envelope. The four women sit at the table and make up a letter to send to my mother's mother: Dear Aunt Margaret, I take pen in hand to write you this letter and hope this finds you as it leaves us in the best of health. My husband Tommy is in fine form working away and Delia's husband Jimmy is in fine form working away and we hope this finds you in fine form. I am very sorry to tell you that Angela is not in fine form as the baby died, the little girl that was called Margaret after yourself, and Angela has not been the same since lying in the bed with her face to the wall. To make matters worser we think she's expecting again and that's too much altogether. The minute she losses one child there is another one on the way. We don't know how she does it. She's married four years, five children and another on the way. That shows you what can happen when you marry someone from the North for they have no control over themselves up there a bunch of Protestands that they are. He goes out for work every day but we know he spends all his time in the saloons and gets a few dollars for sweeping floors and lifting barrels and spends the money right back on the drink. It's terrible, Aunt Margaret, and we all think Angela and the children would be better off in her native land. We don't have the money to buy the tickets ourselves for times is hard but you might be able to see your way. Hopping this finds you in fine form as it leaves us thank God and His Blessed Mother.
I remain your loving neice
Philomena Flynn (what was MacNamara) and last but not least your neice Delia Fortune (what was MacNamara, too, ha ha ha)
Grandma Sheehan sent money to Philomena and Delia. They bought the tickets, found a steamer trunk at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, hired a van to take us to the pier in Manhattan, put us on the ship, said Good- bye and good riddance, and went away.
The ship pulled away from the dock. Mam said, That's the Statue of Liberty and that's Ellis Island where all the immigrants came in. Then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the Atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view. Passengers cursed and ran, seagulls came from all over the harbor and Mam hung limp and pale on the ship's rail.
II
In a week we arrived at Moville, County Donegal, where we took a bus to Belfast and from there another bus to Toome in County Antrim. We left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to Grandpa McCourt's house. It was dark on the road, the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond.
Dad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger. Mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road. We sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue. Birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields, standing, looking at us. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?
Cows, son.
What are cows, Dad?
Cows are cows, son.
We walked farther along the brightening road and there were other
creatures in the fields, white furry creatures. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?
Sheep, son.
What are sheep, Dad?
My father barked at him, Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know?
And Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins through the world.
Dad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep maaed, the goat ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything. A man called from the motor car, Good Lord, what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an Easter Sunday morning?
Dad said, Good morning, Father.
Father? I said. Dad, is that your father?
Mam said, Don't ask him any questions.
Dad said, No, no, this is a priest.
Malachy said, What's a-? but Mam put her hand over his mouth. The priest had white hair and a white collar. He said, Where are
you going?
Dad said, Up the road to McCourts of Moneyglass, and the priest
took us in his motor car. He said he knew the McCourts, a fine family, good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he'd see us all at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn't know what a priest was, God help us.
At the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, no, not that way. Not the front gate. They use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals.
We make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad pushes in the door and there's Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something.
Och, says Grandpa, you're here.
Och, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother. This is Angela, he says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down and have some tea. Would you like boxty?
Malachy says, What's boxty?
Dad laughs. Pancakes, son. Pancakes made with potatoes.
Grandpa says, We have eggs. It's Easter Sunday and you can have all
the eggs you can hold.
We have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep. I
wake up in a bed with Malachy and the twins. My parents are in another bed over by the window. Where am I? It's getting dark. This is not the ship. Mam snores hink, Dad snores honk. I get up and poke at Dad. I have to pee. He says, Use the chamber pot.
What?
Under the bed, son. The chamber pot. It has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen. Pee in that, son.
I want to ask him what he's talking about for even if I'm bursting I feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting, whatever they are. We had nothing like this in Classon Avenue where Mrs. Leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall.
Now Malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it. Dad says, No, you can't do that, son. You have to go outside. When he says that I have to go, too, to sit. He leads us downstairs and through the big room where Grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and Grandma is dozing in her chair. It's dark outside, though the moon is bright enough for us to see where we're going. Dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it. He shows Malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail. Then he tells us wait while he goes inside, closes the door and grunts. The moon is so bright I can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and I wonder why they don't go home.
In the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents. Dad says, These are your aunts: Emily, Nora, Maggie, Vera. Your aunt Eva is in Ballymena with children like you. My aunts are not like Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey, they nod their heads but they don't hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and when
Dad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they just nod again.
Grandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea. The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again. When Mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches over to comfort him. She says, There, there, and I wonder why everyone says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there means.
It's quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now.
Dad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don't know what you're going to do, Malachy. Things are worse here than they are in America. No work here and, God knows, we don't have room in this house for six more people.
Dad says, I thought I might get work on some of the farms. We could get a small place.
Where would you stay in the meantime? says Grandma. And how would you support yourself and your family?
Och, I could go on the dole, I suppose.
You can't get off a ship from America and go on the dole, says Grandpa. They make you wait a while and what would you do while you're waiting?
Dad says nothing and Mam looks straight ahead at the wall.
You'd be better off in the Free State, says Grandma. Dublin is big and surely there's work there or in the farms around.
You're entitled to money from the IRA, too, says Grandpa. You did your bit and they've been handing out money to men all over the Free State. You could go to Dublin and ask for help. We can loan you the bus fare to Dublin. The twins can sit on your lap and you won't have to pay for them.
Dad says, Och, aye, and Mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes.
After we ate we went back to bed and next morning, all the grown- ups sat around looking sad. Soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk. They lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus. Dad said we were going to Dublin. Malachy said, What's Dublin? but no one answered him. Dad held Eugene on his lap and Mam held Oliver. Dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where Cuchulain liked to go for a walk. I asked him where Cuchulain hit the ball into the dog's mouth and he said a few miles away.
Malachy said, Look, look, and we looked. It was a great silvery sheet of water and Dad said it was Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland, the lake where Cuchulain used to swim after his great battles. Cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into Lough Neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days. Some day we'd all come back and go swimming like Cuchulain himself. We'd fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like Cuchulain, who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them, wriggling, because there's great power in an eel.
Is that right, Dad?
'Tis.
Mam didn't look out the window at Lough Neagh. Her cheek rested on
top of Oliver's head and she stared at the floor of the bus.
Soon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses, motor cars, horses pulling carts, people on bicycles and hundreds walking. Malachy is excited. Dad, Dad, where's the playground, the swings? I want to see Freddie Leibowitz.
Och, son, you're in Dublin now, far from Classon Avenue. You're in Ireland, a long way from New York.
When the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station. Dad tells Mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the IRA man in a place called Terenure. He says there are lavatories in the station for the boys, he won't be long, he'll have money when he returns and we'll all have food. He tells me go with him and Mam says, No, I need him to help. But when Dad says, I'll need help carrying all that money, she laughs and says, All right, go with your Pop.
Your Pop. That means she's in a good mood. If she says your father it means she's in a bad mood.
Dad holds my hand as I trot along beside him. He's a fast walker, it's a long way to Terenure and I'm hoping he'll stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in Toome. But he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where Terenure is. In awhile he says we're in Terenure and now we have to find Mr. Charles Heggarty of the IRA. A man with a pink patch on his eye tells us we're on the right street, Charlie Heggarty lives at number fourteen, God blast him. The man tells Dad, I can see you're a man that did his bit. Dad says, Och, I did my bit, and the man says, I did me bit, too, and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldn't feed a canary.
But Ireland is free, says Dad, and that's a grand thing.
Free, my arse, the man says. I think we were better off under the English. Good luck to you anyway, mister, for I think I know what you're here for.
A woman opens the door at number fourteen. I'm afraid, she says, that Mr. Heggarty is busy. Dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of Dublin with his small son, that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place, and if Mr. Heggarty is that busy then we'll wait for him on the doorstep.
The woman is back in a minute to say Mr. Heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way. Mr. Heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire. He says, What can I do for you? Dad stands before the desk and says, I have just returned from America with wife and four children. We have nothing. I fought with a Flying Column during the Troubles and I'm hoping you can help me now in the time of need.
Mr. Heggarty takes Dad's name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk. He shakes his head, No, no record of your service here. Dad makes a long speech. He tells Mr. Heggarty how he fought, where, when, how he had to be smuggled out of Ireland because of the price on his head, how he was raising his sons to love Ireland.
Mr. Heggarty says he's sorry but he can't be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit. Dad says to me, Remember this, Francis. This is the new Ireland. Little men in little chairs with little bits of paper. This is the Ireland men died for. Mr. Heggarty says he'll look into Dad's claim and he'll be sure to let him know what turns up. He'll let us have money to take the bus back into the city. Dad looks at the coins in Mr. Heggarty's hand and says, You could add to that and make the price of a pint.
Oh, it's the drink you want, is it?
One pint is hardly drink.
You'd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a
pint, wouldn't you?
Walking never killed anyone.
I want you to leave this house, says Mr. Heggarty, or I'll call a
guard, and you can be sure you'll never hear from me again. We're not handing out money to support the Guinness family.
Night falls along the streets of Dublin. Children laugh and play under streetlights, mothers call from doorways, smells of cooking come at us all the way, through windows we see people around tables, eating. I'm tired and hungry and I want Dad to carry me but I know there's no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set. I let him hold my hand and I run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where Mam is waiting with my brothers.
They're all asleep on the bench, my mother and three brothers. When Dad tells Mam there's no money she shakes her head and sobs, Oh, Jesus, what are we going to do? A man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her, What's up, missus? Dad tells him we're stranded there at the bus station, we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry. The man says he's going off duty now, he'll take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway, and they'll see what can be done.
The man in uniform tells us we can call him guard. That's what you call policemen in Ireland. He asks us what you call policemen in America and Malachy says, cop. The guard pats him on the head and tells him he's a clever little Yankee.
At the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night. He's sorry but all he can offer is the floor. It's Thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldn't leave the pubs.
The guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and we're so happy we run around the barracks, playing. The guards say we're a great bunch of little Yanks and they'd like to take us home but I say, No, Malachy says, No, the twins say, No, No, and all the guards laugh. Men in cells reach out and pat our heads, they smell like Dad when he comes home singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley going to die. The men say, Jasus, will ye listen to them. They sound like bloody fillum stars. Did yez fall outa the sky or what? Women in cells at the other end tell Malachy he's gorgeous and the twins are dotes. One woman talks to me. C'mere, love, would you like a sweet? I nod, and she says, All right, put your hand out. She takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand. There you are now, she says, a nice bit of butterscotch. Put that in your mouth. I don't want to put it in my mouth because it's sticky and wet from her mouth but I don't know what you're supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and I'm about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes, takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman. You drunken hoor, he says, leave the child alone, and all the women laugh.
The sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench. The rest of us lie on the floor. Dad sits with his back to the wall, his eyes open under the peak of his cap, and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes. The guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says he's from Ballymena in the north and he talks with Dad about people they know there and in other places like Cushendall and Toome. The
guard says he'll have a pension some day and he'll live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. Eels, he says, eels galore. Jasus, I love a fried eel. I ask Dad, Is this Cuchulain? and the guard laughs till his face turns red. Ah, Mother o' God, did yez hear this? The lad wants to know if I'm Cuchulain. A little Yank and he knows all about Cuchulain.
Dad says, No, he's not Cuchulain but he's a fine man who will live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away.
****
Dad is shaking me. Up, Francis, up. It is noisy in the barracks. A boy mopping the floor is singing, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this, Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me?
I tell him that's my mother's song and he's to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and I wonder why people have to sing other people's songs. Men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting. The woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says, I had a drop taken, child. I'm sorry I made a fool of you, but the guard from Ballymena tells her, Move on, you oul' hoor, before I lock you up again.
Oh, lock me up, she says. In, out. What does it matter, you blue arsed bastard.
Mam is sitting up on the bench, the blanket wrapped around her. A woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her, Sure, I'm the sergeant's wife and he said you might need help. Would you like a nice soft-boiled egg, missus?
Mam shakes her head, no.
Ah, now, missus, surely you should have a nice egg in your condition.
But Mam shakes her head and I wonder how she can say no to a soft- boiled egg when there's nothing in the world like it.
All right, ma'am, says the sergeant's wife, a bit of toast, then, and something for the children and your poor husband.
She goes back to another room and soon there's tea and bread. Dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and Mam says, Will you eat your bread, for God's sake. You won't be much use to us falling down with the hunger. He shakes his head and asks the sergeant's wife is there any chance of a cigarette. She brings him the cigarette and tells Mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to Limerick. There will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at Kingsbridge Railway Station and, You'll be in Limerick in three or four hours.
Mam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeant's wife. God bless you and your husband and all the guards, Mam says. I don't know what we'd do without you. God knows 'tis a lovely thing to be back among our own.
'Tis the least we could do, says the sergeant's wife. These are lovely children you have and I'm from Cork meself and I know what 'tis to be in Dublin without two pennies to rub together.
Dad sits at the other end of the bench, smoking his cigarette, drinking his tea. He stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of Dublin. Dad asks the driver if he'd mind going by way of the G. P. O. and the driver says, Is it a stamp you want or what? No, says Dad. I hear they put up a new statue of Cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and I'd like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for Cuchulain.
The driver says he has no notion of who this Cuchulain was but he wouldn't mind stopping one bit. He might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasn't been in the G. P. O. since he was a boy and the English nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the Liffey River. He says you'll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the Irish of English perfidy. I ask the man what's perfidy and he says ask your father and I would but we're stopping outside a big building with columns and that's the G. P. O.
Mam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the G. P. O. There he is, he says, there's your man Cuchulain.
And I feel tears coming because I'm looking at him at last, Cuchulain, there on his pedestal in the G. P. O. He's golden and he has long hair, his head is hanging and there's a big bird perched on his shoulder.
The driver says, Now what in God's name is this all about? What's this fellow doin' with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder? And will you kindly tell me, mister, what this has to do with the men of 1916?
Dad says, Cuchulain fought to the end like the men of Easter Week. His enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew.
Well, says the driver, 'tis a sad day for the men of Ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead. I think we better go now or we'll be missing that train to Limerick.
The sergeant's wife said she'd send a telegram to Grandma to meet us in Limerick and there she was on the platform, Grandma, with white hair, sour eyes, a black shawl, and no smile for my mother or any of us, even my brother, Malachy, who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth. Mam pointed to Dad. This is Malachy, she said, and Grandma nodded and looked away. She called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk. The boys had shaved heads, snotty noses, and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of Limerick. I asked Mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide. Malachy said, What's a lice? and Mam said, Not lice. One of them is a louse. Grandma said, Will ye stop it! What kind o' talk is this? The boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and Grandma told them, Stop that laughin' or 'tis droppin' an' breakin' that trunk ye'll be. They stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you.
Dad carried the twins, Mam carried a bag in one hand and held Malachy's hand with the other. When she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath, Grandma said, Are you still smokin' them fags? Them fags will be the death of you. There's enough consumption in Limerick without people smokin' fags on top of it an'
'tis a rich man's foolishness.
Along the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins. They pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed, everyone except Grandma, who pulled her shawl over her head. Dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers. He said, Flowers, and they ran back and forth, pointing, trying to say Flowers. One of the boys with the trunk said, God, are they Americans? and Mam said, They are. They were born in New York. All the
boys were born in New York. The boy said to the other boy, God, they're Americans. They put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till Grandma said, Are ye goin' to stand here all day lookin' at flowers an' gawkin' at each other? And we all moved on again, out of the park, down a narrow lane and into another lane to Grandma's house.
There is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and Grandma lives in one of the small houses. Her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate. There is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases. This press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because you're not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or there's a visit by a priest.
There is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes. He is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it. Mam tells us, That's the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and I want to know why the man's heart is on fire and why doesn't He throw water on it? Grandma says, Don't these children know anything about their religion? and Mam tells her it's different in America. Grandma says the Sacred Heart is everywhere and there's no excuse for that kind of ignorance.
Under the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him.
Malachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips.
Grandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling Mam to cut the loaf of bread and don't make the cuts too thick. Mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says she'll cut the bread in a minute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see Grandma doesn't like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices.
There aren't enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I don't know under God what I'm goin' to do with ye. There is no room in this house. There isn't room for even one of ye.
Malachy says, Ye, ye, and starts to giggle and I say, Ye, ye, and the twins say, Ye, ye, and we're laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread.
Grandma glares at us. What are ye laughin' at? There's nothin' to laugh at in this house. Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to
ye.
She won't stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with
laughter, spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red.
Dad says, Malachy and the rest of you, stop it. But Malachy can't, he goes on laughing till Dad says, Come over here. He rolls up Malachy's
sleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm.
Are you going to behave yourself?
Malachy's eyes fill with tears and he nods, I will, because Dad
never raised his hand like that before. Dad says, Be a good boy and go sit with your brothers, and he pulls down the sleeve and pats Malachy on the head.
That night Mam's sister, Aunt Aggie, came home from her job in the clothing factory. She was big like the MacNamara sisters, and she had flaming red hair. She wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper. She was living in Grandma's because she had a fight with her husband, Pa Keating, who told her, when he had drink taken, You're a great fat cow, go home to your mother. That's what Grandma told Mam and that's why there was no room for us in Grandma's house. She had herself, Aunt Aggie, and her son Pat, who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers.
Aunt Aggie complained when Grandma told her Mam would have to sleep with her that night. Grandma said, Oh, will you shut your gob. 'Tis only for one night an' that won't kill you an' if you don't like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin' home to me. Jesus, Mary an' Holy St. Joseph, look at this house- you an' Pat an' Angela and her clatther of Americans. Will I have any peace in the latter end of my life?
She spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle. Dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen, took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it, and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold.
In the morning, Aunt Aggie came for her bicycle telling us, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of my way?
When she left, Malachy kept saying, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of the way, will ye? and I could hear Dad laughing out in the kitchen till Grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell Malachy be quiet.
That day Grandma and Mam went out and found a furnished room on Windmill Street where Aunt Aggie had a flat with her husband, Pa Keating. Grandma paid the rent, ten shillings for two weeks. She gave Mam money for food, loaned us a kettle, a pot, a frying pan, knives and spoons, jam jars to be used for mugs, a blanket and a pillow. She said that was all she could afford anymore, that Dad would have to get up off his arse, get a job, go on the dole, go for the charity at the St. Vincent de Paul Society or go on the relief.
The room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money. We had a table and three chairs and a bed, which Mam said was the biggest she had ever seen. We were glad of the bed that night, worn out after nights on floors in Dublin and in Grandma's. It didn't matter that there were six of us in the bed, we were together, away from grandmothers and guards, Malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked.
Dad and Mam lay at the head of the bed, Malachy and I at the bottom, the twins wherever they could find comfort. Malachy made us laugh again. Ye, ye, ye, he said, and oy oy oy, and then fell asleep. Mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping. In the moonlight I could look up the length of the bed and see Dad still awake and when Oliver cried in his sleep Dad reached for him and held him. Whisht, he said. Whisht.
Then Eugene sat up, screaming, tearing at himself. Ah, ah, Mommy, Mommy. Dad sat up. What? What's up, son? Eugene went on crying and when Dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh. We slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body, hopping, biting. We tore at the bites till they bled. We jumped from the bed, the twins crying, Mam moaning,
Oh, Jesus, will we have no rest! Dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites. The salt burned but he said we'd feel better
soon.
Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap. Dad pulled on
his trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street. He filled the kettle and the pot with water, stood the mattress against the wall, pounded it with a shoe, told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there. The Limerick moon was so bright I could see bits of it shimmering in the water and I wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could I with the fleas leaping on my legs. Dad kept pounding with the shoe and I had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot. Mam said, Look at you. Your shoes are drenched and you'll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot.
A man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o' God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won't know where they are and they'll be biting the mattress or each other, which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They're a right bloody torment an' I should know for didn't I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an' the fleas there were so plentiful an' forward they'd sit on the toe of your boot an' discuss Ireland's woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an'I wouldn't put it past the English. An'isn't it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an' the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an' have a good night's sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin' no harm, they wouldn't bother you unless you cornered them an' they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an'such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin' noon an' night for that's his nature an' he can't help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You're forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin' here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus.
Dad said, You wouldn't by any chance have a cigarette, would you?
A cigarette? Oh, sure, of course. Here you are. Aren't I nearly destroyed from the fags myself. The oul' hacking cough, you know. So powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle. I can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an' workin' its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o' me head.
He struck a match on a box, lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for Dad. Of course, he said, you're bound to have the cough when you live in Limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption. If all the people that has consumption in Limerick were to die this would be a ghost town,
though I don't have consumption meself. No, this cough was a present from the Germans. He paused, puffed on his cigarette, and struggled with a cough. Bejesus, excuse the language, but the fags'll get me in the end. Well, I'll leave you now to the mattress an' remember what I told you, confuse the little buggers.
He wobbled away on his bicycle, the cigarette dangling from his mouth, the cough racking his body. Dad said, Limerickmen talk too much. Come on, we'll put this mattress back and see if there's any sleep in this night.
Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap, and Malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet. She said, Who was that you were talking to? It sounded very like Pa Keating, Aggie's husband. I could tell by the cough. He got that cough in France in the war when he swallowed the gas.
We slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches.
Mam made tea and fried bread, and once more Dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water. He hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard. On a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and we'd all have a good night's sleep.
A few days later when we're settled into the room Dad is shaking me out of my dreams. Up, Francis, up. Put on your clothes and run over for your aunt Aggie. Your mother needs her. Hurry.
Mam is moaning in the bed, her face pure white. Dad has Malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire. I run across the street and knock on Aunt Aggie's door till Uncle Pat Keating comes coughing and grumbling, What's up? What's up?
My mother is moaning in the bed. I think she's sick.
Now Aunt Aggie comes grumbling. Ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from America.
Leave him alone, Aggie, he's only a child that's doing what he's told.
She tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the morning not like some from the North that she won't mention. He says, No, no, I'm coming. There's something wrong with Angela.
Dad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don't know what's up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear Aunt
Aggie
Pa is
about
never looks at him.
telling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and Uncle out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what you like Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn't talk to my father,
Malachy says, Dad, is Mammy sick?
Och, she'll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor.
I wonder what child is lost because we're all here, one two three
four of us, not a lost child anywhere and why can't they tell me what's wrong with my mother. Uncle Pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him. A man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry Mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed. Malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died. I want to ask Dad to tell me if Mam will be gone forever like my sister Margaret but he's going with Mam and there's no use asking Aunt Aggie anything for fear she'd bite your head off. She wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till Dad comes home.
It's the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till Dad comes home and tells us Mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and she'll be home in no time.
Later, Dad goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. There is no hope of a laboring man with a North of Ireland accent getting a job in Limerick.
When he returns, he tells Mam we'll be getting nineteen shillings a week. She says that's just enough for all of us to starve on. Nineteen shillings for six of us? That's less than four dollars in American money and how are we supposed to live on that? What are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight? If the rent for this room is five shillings a week we'll have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea.
Dad shakes his head, sips his tea from a jam jar, stares out the window and whistles ""The Boys of Wexford. "" Malachy and Oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and Dad doesn't know whether to whistle or smile because you can't do both and he can't help himself. He has to stop and smile and pat Oliver's head and then go back to the whistling. Mam smiles, too, but it's a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down.
Next day she tells Dad to mind the twins and takes Malachy and me with her to the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls. They ask our names and smile when we talk. They say, Lord above, would you listen to the little Yankees, and they wonder why Mam in her American coat would be looking for charity since there's hardly enough for the poor people of Limerick without Yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths.
Mam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in Brooklyn, that her husband has no work, that she has other children at home, twin boys. The women sniff and pull their shawls about them, they have their own troubles. Mam tells them she had to leave America because she couldn't stand it after her baby girl died. The women sniff again but now it's because Mam is crying. Some say they lost little ones, too, and there's nothing worse in the world, you could live as long as Methuselem's wife but you never get over it. No man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child, not if the man lived longer than two Methuselems.
They all have a good cry till a red-haired woman passes a little box around. The women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses. A young woman sneezes and the red-haired woman laughs. Ah, sure, Biddy, you're not able for that snuff. Come here, little Yankee boys, have a pinch. She plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls. Mam tells us, That's good for ye, 'twill clear yeer heads.
The young woman, Biddy, tells Mam we're two lovely boys. She points at Malachy. That little fella with the goldy ringlet, isn't he gorgeous? He could be a film star with Shirley Temple. And Malachy smiles and warms up the queue.
The woman with the snuff says to Mam, Missus, I don't want to be forward but I think you should be sitting down for we heard about your
loss.
Another woman worries, Ah, no, they don't like that. Who don't like what?
Ah, sure, Nora Molloy, the Society don't like us sittin' on the steps. They want us to be standin' respectful against the wall.
They can kiss my arse, says Nora, the red-haired woman. Sit down there, missus, on that step an' I'll sit next to you an' if there's one word out of the St. Vincent de Paul Society I'll take the face off 'em, so I will. Do you smoke, missus?
I do, says Mam, but I don't have them.
Nora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron, breaks it, and offers half to Mam.
The worried woman says, They don't like that either. They say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child. Mr. Quinlivan inside is dead against it. He says if you have money for the fags you have money for food.
Quinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul' bastard. Is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag, the only comfort we have in the world?
A door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears. Are any of ye waiting for children's boots?
Women raise their hands, I am. I am.
Well, the boots are all gone. Ye'll have to come back next month. But my Mikey needs boots for school.
They're all gone, I told you.
But 'tis freezin' abroad, Mr. Quinlivan.
The boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What's this? Who's
smoking?
Nora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to
the last ash.
Every puff you take, he starts.
I know, she says, I'm taking food out of the mouths of my children. You're insolent, woman. You'll get no charity here.
Is that a fact? Well, Mr. Quinlivan, if I don't get it here I know
where I will.
What are you talking about?
I'll go to the Quakers. They'll give me the charity.
Mr. Quinlivan steps toward Nora and points a finger. Do you know
what we have here? We have a souper in our midst. We had the soupers in the Famine. The Protestants went round telling good Catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned Protestant they'd get more soup than their bellies could hold and, God help us, some Catholics took the soup, and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell. And you, woman, if you go to the Quakers you'll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children.
other
Then, Mr. Quinlivan, you'll have to save us, won't you?
He stares at her and she stares back at him. His eyes wander to the
women. One puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh.
What are you tittering about? he barks.
Oh, nothing, Mr. Quinlivan. Honest to God.
I'm telling ye once more, no boots. And he slams the door behind
him.
One by one the women are called into the room. When Nora comes out
she's smiling and waving a piece of paper. Boots, she says. Three pairs I'm gettin' for my children. Threaten the men in there with the Quakers and they'll give you the drawers off their arses.
When Mam is called she brings Malachy and me in with her. We stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions. Mr. Quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says, Enough out of you, Quinlivan. If we left it up to you we'd have the poor people of Limerick jumping into the arms of the Protestants.
He turns to Mam, he wants to know where she got that fine red coat. She tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of Margaret she shakes and sobs. She tells the men she's very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and she's not over it yet, not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all, not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didn't have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and it's a heart scald to think Margaret might be in Limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether we're in heaven, hell, or Purgatory itself.
Mr. Quinlivan brings her his chair. Ah, now, missus. Ah, now. Sit down, will you. Ah, now.
The other men look at the table, the ceiling. The man in the middle says he's giving Mam a docket to get a week's groceries at McGrath's shop on Parnell Street. There will be tea, sugar, flour, milk, butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from Sutton's coal yard on the Dock Road.
The third man says, Of course you won't be getting this every week, missus. We will be visiting your house to see if there's a real need. We have to do that, missus, so we can review your claim.
Mam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness. They nod and look at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman.
The women outside tell Mam, When you go to McGrath's, keep an eye on the oul' bitch for she'll cheat you on the weight. She'll put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you can't see it. She'll pull on that paper so that you're lucky if you get half of what you're supposed to get. And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus all over the shop, and she's forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph's chapel clackin' her rosary beads an' breathing like a virgin martyr, the oul' bitch.
Nora says, I'll go with you, missus. I'm on to the same Mrs. McGrath and I'll know if she's cheating you.
She leads the way to the shop in Parnell Street. The woman behind the counter is pleasant to Mam in her American coat till Mam shows the St. Vincent de Paul docket. The woman says, I don't know what you're doing here at this hour of the day. I never serve the charity cases before six in the evening. But this is your first time and I'll make an exception.
She says to Nora, Do you have a docket, too?
No. I'm a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the St. Vincent de Paul.
The woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag. When she finishes pouring, she says, There's a pound of flour.
I don't think so, says Nora. That's a very small pound of flour. The woman flushes and glares, Are you accusin' me?
Ah, no, Mrs. McGrath, says Nora. I think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didn't even know the paper was pulled down a bit. Oh, God, no. A woman like you that's forever on her knees before the Virgin Mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money I see on the floor there?
Mrs. McGrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers. What money? she says, till she looks at Nora, and knows. Nora smiles. Must be a trick of the shadows, she says, and smiles at the scale. There was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour.
That scale gives me more trouble, says Mrs. McGrath.
I'm sure it does, says Nora.
But my conscience is clear before God, says Mrs. McGrath.
I'm sure it is, says Nora, and you're admired by one and all at the
St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary.
I try to be a good Catholic.
Try? God knows 'tis little trying you'd have for you're well known
for having a kind heart and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here.
Well, now, I'm not a millionaire, but here...
God bless you, Mrs. McGrath, and I know it's asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes?
Well, now, they're not on the docket. I'm not here to supply luxuries.
If you could see your way, missus, I'd be sure to mention your kindness to the St. Vincent de Paul.
All right, all right, says Mrs. McGrath. Here. One time for the cigarettes and one time only.
God bless you, says Nora, and I'm sorry you had so much trouble with that scale.
On the way home we stopped in the People's Park and sat on a bench while Malachy and I sucked on our sweets and Mam and Nora smoked their cigarettes. The smoking brought on Nora's cough and she told Mam the fags would kill her in the end, that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age, though who would want to in Limerick, a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs, all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms.
You're lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I'd give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus. We grew up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything and signs on, we're mothers before we're women. And there's nothing here but rain and oul' biddies saying the rosary. I'd give me teeth to get out, go to America or even England itself. The champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum.
She drew on her cigarette and gagged, coughing till her body rocked back and forth, and in between the coughs she whimpered, Jesus, Jesus. When the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine. She said, I'll see you next week, missus, at the St. Vincent de
Paul. If you're stuck for anything send a message to me at Vize's Field. Ask anyone for the wife of Peter Molloy, champion pint drinker.
Eugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed. Dad sits by the fireplace with Oliver on his lap. I wonder why Dad is telling Oliver a Cuchulain story. He knows the Cuchulain stories are mine, but when I look at Oliver I don't mind. His cheeks are bright red, he's staring into the dead fire, and you can see he has no interest in Cuchulain. Mam puts her hand on his forehead. I think he has a fever, she says. I wish I had an onion and I'd boil it in milk and pepper. That's good for the fever. But even if I had what would I boil the milk on? We need coal for that fire.
She gives Dad the docket for the coal down the Dock Road. He takes me with him but it's dark and all the coal yards are closed.
What are we going to do now, Dad?
I don't know, son.
Ahead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal
along the road.
There, Dad, there's coal.
Och, no, son. We won't pick coal off the road. We're not beggars. He tells Mam the coal yards are closed and we'll have to drink milk
and eat bread tonight, but when I tell her about the women on the road she passes Eugene to him.
If you're too grand to pick coal off the road I'll put on my coat and go down the Dock Road.
She gets a bag and takes Malachy and me with her. Beyond the Dock Road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it. Mam says that's the River Shannon. She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. The other women are gone from the Dock Road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries. Mam tells us gather anything that burns, coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet. When her bag is nearly full she says, Now we have to find an onion for Oliver. Malachy says he'll find one but she tells him, No, you don't find onions on the road, you get them in shops.
The minute he sees a shop he cries out, There's a shop, and runs
in.
Oonyen, he says. Oonyen for Oliver.
Mam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter, I'm
sorry. The woman says, Lord, he's a dote. Is he an American or what? Mam says he is. The woman smiles and shows two teeth, one on each
side of her upper gum. A dote, she says, and look at them gorgeous goldy curls. And what is it he wants now? A sweet?
Ah, no, says Mam. An onion.
The woman laughs, An onion? I never heard a child wanting an onion before. Is that what they like in America?
Mam says, I just mentioned I wanted to get an onion for my other child that's sick. Boil the onion in milk, you know.
True for you, missus. You can't beat the onion boiled in milk. And look, little boy, here's a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy, the brother, I suppose.
Mam says, Ah, sure, you shouldn't. Say thank you, boys.
The woman says, Here's a nice onion for the sick child, missus.
Mam says, Oh, I can't buy the onion now, missus. I don't have a penny on me.
I'm giving you the onion, missus. Let it never be said a child went sick in Limerick for want of an onion. And don't forget to sprinkle in a little pepper. Do you have pepper, missus?
Ah, no, I don't but I should be getting it any day now.
Well, here, missus. Pepper and a little salt. Do the child all the good in the world.
Mam says, God bless you, ma'am, and her eyes are watery.
Dad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get the onion?
I did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He's my favorite saint, patron of desperate cases.
I got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude.
Dad says, You shouldn't be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar. It isn't right. Bad example for the boys.
Then you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road.
Malachy says, I'm hungry, and I'm hungry, too, but Mam says, Ye'll wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk.
She gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire.
Ah, come on, love, she says. Good for you. Make you big and strong.
He tightens his mouth against the spoon. She puts the pot down, rocks him till he's asleep, lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or she'll demolish us. She slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread. She lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars. She says, That fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter.
The fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping. Eugene falls asleep on the floor and Dad lifts him to the bed beside Oliver. Mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it. She says she's tired out from the day, the Vincent de Paul Society, Mrs. McGrath's shop, the search for coal down the Dock Road, the worry over Oliver not wanting the boiled onion, and if he's like this tomorrow she's taking him to the doctor, and now she's going to bed.
Soon we're all in bed and if there's the odd flea I don't mind because it's warm in the bed with the six of us and I love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black, red and black, till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from Oliver turning in my mother's arms.
In the morning Dad is lighting the fire, making tea, cutting the bread. He's already dressed and he's telling Mam hurry up and get dressed. He says to me, Francis, your little brother Oliver is sick and we're taking him to the hospital. You are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers. We'll be back soon.
Mam says, When we're out go easy with that sugar. We're not millionaires.
When Mam picks up Oliver and wraps him in a coat Eugene stands on the bed. I want Ollie, he says. Ollie play.
Ollie will be back soon, she says, and you can play with him. Now you can play with Malachy and Frank.
Ollie, Ollie, I want Ollie.
He follows Oliver with his eyes and when they're gone he sits on the bed looking out the window. Malachy says, Genie, Genie, we have bread, we have tea. Sugar on your bread, Genie. He shakes his head and pushes away the bread Malachy is offering. He crawls to the place where Oliver slept with Mam, puts his head down and stares out the window.
Grandma is at the door. I heard your father and mother were running down Henry Street with the child in their arms. Now where are they gone to?
Oliver is sick, I said. He wouldn't eat the boiled onion in milk. What are you blatherin' about?
Wouldn't eat the boiled onion and got sick.
And who's minding ye?
I am.
And what's up with the child in the bed? What's That's Eugene. He misses Oliver. They're twins. I know they're twins. That child looks starved.
his name?
Have ye any
porridge here?
What's porridge? says Malachy.
Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! What's porridge! Porridge is
porridge. That's what porridge is. Ye are the most ignorant bunch o' Yanks I ever seen. Come on, put on yeer clothes and we'll go across the street to your aunt Aggie. She's there with the husband, Pa Keating, and she'll give ye some porridge.
She picks up Eugene, wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to Aunt Aggie's. She's living with Uncle Pa again because he said she wasn't a fat cow after all.
Do you have any porridge? Grandma says to Aunt Aggie.
Porridge? Am I supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of Yanks? Pity about you, says Grandma. It won't kill you to give them a
little porridge.
And I suppose they'll be wanting sugar and milk on top of
everything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you don't mind. I don't know why we have to pay for Angela's mistakes.
Jesus, says Grandma, 'tis a good thing you didn't own that stable in Bethlehem or the Holy Family would still be wanderin' the world crumblin' with the hunger.
Grandma pushes her way past Aunt Aggie, puts Eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge. A man comes in from another room. He has black curly hair and his skin is black and I like his eyes because they're very blue and ready to smile. He's Aunt Aggie's husband, the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes, the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war.
Malachy says, Why are you all black? and Uncle Pa Keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette. Oh, the little Yanks, he says. They're not a bit shy. I'm black because I work at the Limerick Gas Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works. When you grow up you'll laugh.
Malachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea. They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle because he's married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of Pa Keating's skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating's shirt.
I think he likes me, says Pa, and that's when Aunt Aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl, Waah, waah, waah, big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face.
Aw, Jesus, says Grandma, there she is again. What's up with you this time?
And Aunt Aggie blubbers, To see Pa there with a child on his lap an' me with no hope of having my own.
Grandma barks at her, Stop talkin' like that in front of the children. Have you no shame? When God is good and ready He'll send you your family.
Aunt Aggie sobs, Angela with five born an' one just gone an' her so useless she couldn't scrub a floor an' me with none an' I can scrub an' clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry.
Pa Keating laughs, I think I'll keep this little fella.
Malachy runs to him. No, no, no. That's my brother, that's Eugene. And I say, No, no, no, that's our brother. Aunt Aggie pats the tears on her cheeks. She says, I don't want nothing of Angela's. I don't want nothing that's half Limerick and half North of Ireland, so I don't, so ye can take him home. I'll have me own someday if I have to do a hundred novenas to the Virgin Mary and her mother, St. Ann, or if I have to crawl from here to Lourdes on me two bended knees.
Grandma says, That's enough. Ye have had yeer porridge and 'tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital.
She puts on her shawl and goes to pick up Eugene but he clutches so hard at Pa Keating's shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at Pa till we're out the door.
***
We followed Grandma back to our room. She put Eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water. She told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother, Oliver, would be home soon and they'd be playing again there on the floor.
But he kept looking out the window.
She told Malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers. Malachy went to the bed and sat by Eugene and I sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head on the table and fell asleep.
Dad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care of your little brothers.
Mam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I'll go down to
Thompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. The St. Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows.
She goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och.
Dad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and I don't know what to do though I wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because it's a long time since we had the porridge. If Dad would move away from the fireplace I could light the fire myself. All you need is paper, a few bits of coal or turf, and a match. He won't move so I try to go around his legs while he's beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why I'm trying to light the fire. I tell him we're all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh. Hungry? he says. Och, Francis, your wee brother Oliver is dead. Your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead.
He picks me up and hugs me so hard I cry out. Then Malachy cries, my mother cries, Dad cries, I cry, but Eugene stays quiet. Then Dad sniffles, We'll have a feast. Come on, Francis.
He tells my mother we'll be back in awhile but she has Malachy and Eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesn't look up. He carries me through the streets of Limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance.
Dad says he's glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and they tell him they don't need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a knacker.
A few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, We'll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here?
There are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too. They lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink. There is creamy white stuff on their lips, which they lick with little sighs. Uncle Pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and Dad gives me a piece of bread and I don't feel hungry anymore. Still, I wonder how long we'll sit here with Malachy and Eugene hungry at home, hours from the porridge, which Eugene didn't eat anyway.
Dad and Uncle Pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another. Uncle Pa says, Frankie, this is the pint. This is the staff of life. This is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned.
He laughs and Dad smiles and I laugh because I think that's what you're supposed to do when Uncle Pa says something. He doesn't laugh when he tells the other men about Oliver dying. The other men tip their hats to Dad. Sorry for your troubles, mister, and surely you'll have a pint.
Dad says yes to the pints and soon he's singing Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry and song after song I never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl, Margaret, that died in America and his little boy, Oliver, dead beyond in the City Home Hospital. It frightens me the way he
yells and cries and sings and I wish I could be at home with my three brothers, no, my two brothers, and my mother.
The man behind the bar says to Dad, I think now, mister, you've had enough. We're sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire.
Dad says, One, one more pint, just one, eh? and the man says no. Dad shakes his fist. I did me bit for Ireland, and when the man comes out and takes Dad's arm, Dad tries to push him away.
Uncle Pa says, Come on now, Malachy, stop the blaguarding. You have to go home to Angela. You have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you.
But Dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness. Uncle Pa stumbles out with the bag of food. Come on, he says. We'll go back to your room.
Dad wants to go to another place for a pint but Uncle Pa says he has no more money. Dad says he'll tell everyone his sorrows and they'll give him pints. Uncle Pa says that's a disgraceful thing to do and Dad cries on his shoulder. You're a good friend, he tells Uncle Pa. He cries again till Uncle Pa pats him on the back. It's terrible, terrible, says Uncle Pa, but you'll get over this in time.
Dad straightens up and looks at him. Never, he says. Never.
Next day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse. They put Oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard. They put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth. My mother and Aunt Aggie cried, Grandma looked angry, Dad, Uncle Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat Sheehan looked sad but did not cry and I thought that if you're a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint.
I did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and I did not want to leave Oliver with them. I threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward Oliver's grave. Dad said I shouldn't throw rocks at jackdaws, they might be somebody's soul. I didn't know what a soul was but I didn't ask him because I didn't care. Oliver was dead and I hated jackdaws. I'd be a man someday and I'd come back with a bag of rocks and I'd leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws.
The morning after Oliver's burial Dad went to the Labour Exchange to sign and collect the week's dole, nineteen shillings and sixpence. He said he'd be home by noon, that he'd get coal and make a fire, that we'd have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of Oliver, that we might even have a sweet or two.
He wasn't home by noon, or one, or two, and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before. He wasn't home anytime before the sun went down that day in May. There was no sign of him till we heard him, long after the pubs closed, rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep- Alas, and well may Erin weep When Connacht lies in slumber deep.
There lake and plain smile fair and free, 'Mid rocks their guardian chivalry.
Sing, Oh, let man learn liberty
From crashing wind and lashing sea.
He stumbled into the room, hanging on to the wall. A snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. He tried to speak. Zeeze shildren should be in bed. Lishen to me. Shildren go to bed.
Mam faced him. These children are hungry. Where's the dole money? We'll get fish and chips so they'll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep.
She tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away. Have respheck, he said. Reshpeck in front of shildren.
She struggled to get at his pockets. Where's the money? The children are hungry. You mad oul' bastard, did you drink all the money again? Just what you did in Brooklyn.
He blubbered, Och, poor Angela. And poor wee Margaret and poor wee Oliver.
He staggered to me and hugged me and I smelled the drink I used to smell in America. My face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and I was hungry and I didn't know what to say when he cried all over my head.
Then he let me go and hugged Malachy, still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground, and how we all have to pray and be good, how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us. He said we have our troubles but it's time for Malachy and me to start school because there's nothing like an education, it will stand to you in the end, and you have to get ready to do your bit for Ireland.
***
Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Windmill Street. She can't sleep with the memory of Oliver in that room, Oliver in the bed, Oliver playing on the floor, Oliver sitting on Dad's lap by the fire. She says it's not good for Eugene to be in that place, that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand. There's a room going on Hartstonge Street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us, no, the five of us. We're getting that room and to make sure she's going to the Labour Exchange on Thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute it's handed to Dad. He says she can't do that, he'd be disgraced with the other men. The Labour Exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses. She says, Pity about you. If you didn't squander the money in the pubs I wouldn't have to follow you the way I did in Brooklyn.
He tells her he'll be shamed forever. She says she doesn't care. She wants that room on Hartstonge Street, a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in Brooklyn, a room without fleas and the dampness that kills. She wants that room because it's on the same street as Leamy's National School and Malachy and I can come home at the dinner hour, which is noon, for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread.
On Thursday Mam follows Dad to the Labour Exchange. She marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward Dad she takes it. The other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and Dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a man's dole money. He might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like Mam the horses will stop running and Guinness will go broke. But she has the money now and we move to Hartstonge Street. Then she carries Eugene in her arms and we go up the street to Leamy's National School. The headmaster, Mr. Scallan, says we are to
return on Monday with a composition book, a pencil, and a pen with a good nib on it. We are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times, not on the floor, that spreads the consumption, or on our sleeves, but in a handkerchief or a clean rag. He asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are, he says, Good Lord, what's this? Are they Yanks or what?
Mam tells him about Margaret and Oliver and he says, Lord above, Lord above, there's great suffering in the world. Anyway, we'll put the little fellow, Malachy, in the infants' class and his brother in first class. They're in the same room with one master. Monday morning, then, nine o'clock prompt.
The boys in Leamy's want to know why we talk like that. Are ye Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they want to know, Are ye gangsters or cowboys?
A big boy sticks his face up to mine. I'm asking ye a question, he says. Are ye gangsters or cowboys?
I tell him I don't know and when he pokes his finger into my chest Malachy says, I'm a gangster, Frank's a cowboy. The big boy says, Your little brother is smart and you're a stupid Yank.
The boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but there's a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and I'm pulled away from him.
Mr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he's whacking me across the legs. You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior you brought from America? Well, by God, you'll behave yourself before I'm done with you.
He tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand. Go home now, he says, and tell your mother what a bad boy you were. You're a bad Yank. Say after me, I'm a bad boy.
I'm a bad boy.
Now say, I'm a bad Yank.
I'm a bad Yank.
Malachy says, He's not a bad boy. It's that big boy. He said we
were cowboys and gangsters.
Is that what you did, Heffernan?
I was only jokin', sir.
No more joking, Heffernan. It's not their fault that they're Yanks. 'Tisn't, sir.
And you, Heffernan, should get down on your two knees every night
and thank God you're not a Yank for if you were, Heffernan, you'd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the Atlantic. Al Capone would be coming to you for lessons. You're not to be bothering these two Yanks anymore, Heffernan.
I won't, sir.
And if you do, Heffernan, I'll hang your pelt on the wall. Now go home, all of ye.
There are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, blackthorn sticks. They hit you with the sticks on the shoulders, the back, the legs, and, especially, the hands. If they hit you on the hands it's called a slap. They hit you if you're
late, if you have a leaky nib on your pen, if you laugh, if you talk, and if you don't know things.
They hit you if you don't know why God made the world, if you don't know the patron saint of Limerick, if you can't recite the Apostles' Creed, if you can't add nineteen to forty-seven, if you can't subtract nineteen from forty-seven, if you don't know the chief towns and products of the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you can't find Bulgaria on the wall map of the world that's blotted with spit, snot, and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever.
They hit you if you can't say your name in Irish, if you can't say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can't ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you
about the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates.
One master will hit you if you don't know that Eamon De Valera is
the greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don't know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived.
Mr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he'll hit you.
Mr. O'Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he'll hit you.
If you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they'll all hit
you.
Even if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or
the blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry. You'll be a sissy. There are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever. Some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters. If you don't cry the masters hate you because you've made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up they'll draw tears or blood or both.
Big boys in fifth class tell us Mr. O'Dea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you, pinch your sideburns, which are called cossicks, pull up on them. Up, up, he says, till you're on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes. You don't want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that. Mr. O'Dea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame.
It is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction.
If the master hits you there's no use complaining to your father or mother. They always say, You deserve it. Don't be a baby.
I know Oliver is dead and Malachy knows Oliver is dead but Eugene is too small to know anything. When he wakes in the morning he says, Ollie, Ollie, and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street, especially children with fair hair like him and Oliver. Ollie, Ollie, he says, and Mam picks him up, sobs, hugs him. He struggles to get down because he doesn't want to be picked up and hugged. He wants to find Oliver.
Dad and Mam tell him Oliver is in heaven playing with angels and we'll all see him again someday but he doesn't understand because he's only two and doesn't have the words and that's the worst thing in the whole world.
Malachy and I play with him. We try to make him laugh. We make funny faces. We put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off. We run across the room and pretend to fall down. We take him to the People's Park to see the lovely flowers, play with dogs, roll in the grass.
He sees small children with fair hair like Oliver. He doesn't say Ollie anymore. He only points.
Dad says Eugene is lucky to have brothers like Malachy and me because we help him forget and soon, with God's help, he'll have no memory of Oliver at all.
***
He died anyway.
Six months after Oliver went, we woke on a mean November morning
and there was Eugene, cold in the bed beside us. Dr. Troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasn't he in the hospital long ago? Dad said he didn't know and Mam said she didn't know and Dr. Troy said that's why children die. People don't know. He said if Malachy or I showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night. We were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family. He told Mam he was very sorry for her troubles and he'd give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come. He said God was asking too much, too damn much.
Grandma came over to our room with Aunt Aggie. She washed Eugene, and Aunt Aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads. They dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for Oliver. They placed his hands on his chest, one hand on top of the other, bound in the little white rosary beads. Grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said, Doesn't he have lovely soft silky hair? Mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm. Grandma and Aunt Aggie looked at each other and said nothing. Dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs, talking to Eugene, telling him, Och, it was the River Shannon that harmed you, the dampness from that river that came and took you and Oliver. Grandma said, Will you stop that? You're making the whole house nervous. She took Dr. Troy's prescription and told me run over to O'Connor the chemist for the pills, that there would be no charge due to the kindness of Dr. Troy. Dad said he'd come with me, that we'd go to the Jesuit church and say a prayer for Margaret and Oliver and Eugene, all happy in heaven. The chemist gave us the pills, we stopped to say the prayers, and when we returned to the room, Grandma gave Dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub. Mam said, No, no, but Grandma said, He doesn't have the pills to ease him, God help us, and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort. Then she told him he'd have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage. She told me to go with my father and make sure he didn't stay in the pub all night and drink all the money. Dad said, Och, Frankie shouldn't be in pubs, and she said, Then don't stay there. He put on his cap and we went to South's pub and he told me at the door I could go home now, that he'd be home after one pint. I said, No, and he said, Don't be disobedient. Go home to your poor mother. I said, No, and he said I was a bad boy and God would be displeased. I said I wasn't going home without him and he said, Och, what is the world coming to? He had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles
of stout. Pa Keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and Uncle Pat Sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself. Uncle Pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying, They're mine, they're mine, for fear they'd be taken from him. People who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout. Grandma said, All right, Pat, drink your stout yourself. No one will bother you. She and Aunt Aggie sat on the bed by Eugene. Pa Keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey. Mam took her pills and sat by the fire with Malachy on her lap. She kept saying Malachy had hair like Eugene and Aunt Aggie said no he did not till Grandma drove her elbow into Aunt Aggie's chest and told her shut up. Dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with Eugene. Pa Keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didn't want to laugh or they weren't supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child. He said when he was in the English army in France the Germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital. They kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches. English soldiers were sent home but they didn't give a fiddler's fart about the Irish soldiers, whether they lived or died. Instead of dying Pa made a vast fortune. He said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare. In the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea. He said to himself, Jasus, I have all this gas in my system and 'tis a great pity to waste it. So he shoved a pipe up his arse, lit a match to it, and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan. Tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if he'd let them boil water. He made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to Paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models. He had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to Limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces. He said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year. Aunt Aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and Grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face. Uncle Pat Sheehan, sitting on the floor with his stout, said he was going to sing a song. More power to you, said Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat sang ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He kept saying, Rasheen, Rasheen, mavourneen mean, and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words. Grandma said that was a fine song and Pa Keating said Caruso better look over his shoulder. Dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with Mam. He sat on the edge, put his bottle on the floor, covered his face with his hands and cried. He said, Frank, Frank, come here, and I had to go to him so that he could hug me the way Mam was hugging Malachy. Grandma said, We better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow. They each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed Eugene's forehead. Dad put me down, stood up and nodded to them as they left. When they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it. He ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it. He turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for Malachy and me to be in bed. We'd have to sleep with him and Mam that
night as little Eugene would be needing the bed for himself. It was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on Eugene's lovely soft silky hair.
Dad lights the fire in the morning, makes the tea, toasts the bread in the fire. He brings Mam's toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall. He brings Malachy and me to Eugene to kneel and say a prayer. He says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops. He shows us how to bless ourselves, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen, and he says, Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son, Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver, You took his sister, Margaret. I'm not supposed to question that, am I? Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die but that is Your will. You told the river to kill and the Shannon killed. Could You at last be merciful? Could You leave us the children we have? That is all we ask. Amen.
He helps Malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that we'll be clean for Eugene's funeral. We have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from America. We have to be quiet because Eugene is there with his eyes closed and we don't want him to be waking up and looking out the window for Oliver.
Grandma comes and tells Mam she has to get up. There are children dead, she says, but there are children alive and they need their mother. She brings Mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain. Dad tells Grandma it's Thursday and he has to go to the Labour Exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin. Grandma tells him to take me with him but he says it's better for me to stay with Malachy so that I can pray for my little brother dead in the bed. Grandma says, Is it coddin' me you are? Pray for a little child that's barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven? You'll take your son with you and he'll remind you this is no day for the pubs. She looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap.
At the Labour Exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day. Men touch their caps and say they're sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies, twenty-four pennies, two shillings. Dad tells me I'm rich now and I should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute. I know this place is a pub and I know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but I don't say anything because I want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee. I chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky. Dad is still in the pub and I wonder if I should get another piece of toffee as long as he's in there with the pint. I'm about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there's Aunt Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother's funeral? Gorgin' yourself on sweets. And where's that father of yours?
He's, he's, in the pub.
Of course he's in the pub. You out here stuffin' yourself with sweets and him in there gettin' himself into a staggerin' condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard.
She tells the shop woman, Just like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul' northern jaw. She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country.
Dad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose. They're not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them. I know that's Eugene's coffin because Oliver had one like it and I want to cry when I see the black pints on top of it. I'm sorry now I ever ate that toffee and I wish I could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because it's not right to be eating toffee when Eugene is dead in the bed and I'm frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin. The man with Dad is saying, No, mister, you can't leave a child's coffin in a carriage no more. I did that once, went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage. Can you credit that? It was empty, thank God, but there you are. Desperate times we live in, desperate. The man with Dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down there's a hollow sound in the coffin. Dad nods at me. We'll be going in a minute, son, but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow I push it away.
That's Eugene's coffin. I'll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene's coffin.
Now, son. Now, son.
Dad, that's Eugene's coffin. The other man says, Will we have another pint, mister?
Dad says to me, Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. No.
Don't be a bad boy.
No.
The other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I'd kick his arse from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin' to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can't have a pint the day of a funeral what's the use of livin' at all, at all.
Dad says, All right. We'll go.
They finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves. The man climbs up to the driver's seat of the carriage and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam, Grandma, Aunt Aggie, her husband, Pa Keating, Uncle Pat Sheehan, Uncle Tom Sheehan, who is Mam's oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the North of Ireland. Uncle Tom has his wife, Jane, with him. She's from Galway and people say she has the look of a Spaniard and that's why no one in the family talks to her.
The man takes the coffin from Dad and when he brings it into the room Mam moans, Oh, no, oh, God, no. The man tells Grandma he'll be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard. Grandma tells him he'd better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child that's going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she won't put up with a driver that's drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat.
The man says, Missus, I drove dozens o' children to the graveyard an' never once fell out of any seat, high or low.
The men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells everyone, This is my stout, this is my stout, and Grandma says, 'Tis all right, Pat. No one will take your stout. Then he says he wants to sing ""The Road to Rasheen"" till Pa Keating says, No, Pat, you can't sing on the day of a funeral. You can sing the night before. But Uncle Pat keeps saying, This is my stout and I want to sing ""The Road to Rasheen, "" and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head. He starts to sing his song but stops when Grandma takes the lid off the coffin and Mam sobs, Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, will it ever stop? Will I be left with one child?
Mam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed. She's stroking Eugene's hair and face and hands. She tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving. She tells him 'tis a terrible thing to lose him but isn't he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isn't that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, that we can't be in graveyards in the dark.
Grandma whispers to Aunt Aggie, Who'll put the child in the coffin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won't. That's the job for the mother.
Uncle Pat hears them. I'll put the child in the coffin, he says. He limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam's shoulders. She looks up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I'll put the child in the coffin, Angela.
Oh, Pat, she says. Pat.
I can do it, he says. Sure he's only a small child an' I never lifted a small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I won't drop him, Angela. I won't. Honest to God, I won't.
I know you won't, Pat. I know you won't.
I'll lift him an' I won't be singin'""The Road to Rasheen.""
I know you won't, Pat, Mam says.
Pat pulls down the blanket Mam put there to keep Eugene warm.
Eugene's feet are white and bright with little blue veins. Pat bends over, picks up Eugene and holds him against his chest. He kisses Eugene's forehead and then everyone in the room kisses Eugene. He places Eugene in the coffin and steps back. We are all gathered around looking at Eugene for the last time.
Uncle Pat says, See, I didn't drop him, Angela, and she touches his
face.
Aunt Aggie goes to the pub for the driver. He puts the lid on the
coffin and screws it down. He says, Who's comin' in the carriage? and takes the coffin to the carriage. There's room only for Mam and Dad, Malachy and me. Grandma says, Ye go ahead to the graveyard and we'll wait here.
I don't know why we can't keep Eugene. I don't know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin. I don't know why they had to send Margaret away and Oliver. It is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and I wish I could say something to someone.
The horse clop-clopped through the streets of Limerick. Malachy said, Are we going to see Oliver? and Dad said, No, Oliver is in heaven and don't ask me what heaven is because I don't know.
Mam said, Heaven is a place where Oliver and Eugene and Margaret are happy and warm and we'll see them there some day.
Malachy said, The horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell, and Mam and Dad had to smile.
At the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage. Gimme that coffin, he says, an' I'll carry it up to the grave. He yanks at the coffin and stumbles. Mam says, You're not carrying my child in the condition you're in. She turns to Dad. You carry him, she says. Do what you like, says the driver.
Do what you bloody well like, and he climbs up to his seat.
It's getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in Dad's arms. Mam takes our hands and we follow Dad through the graves. The jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies.
Two men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave. One man says, Ye are very late. Good thing this is a small job or we'd be gone. He climbs into the grave. Hand it to me, he says, and Dad hands him the coffin.
The man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth. Mam lets out a long cry, Oh, Jesus, Jesus, and a jackdaw croaks in a tree. I wish I had a rock to hit that jackdaw. When the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait. One says, Ah, well, now, there's usually a little something for the thirst that's in it.
Dad says, Oh, yes, yes, and gives them money. They say, Sorry for your troubles, and they leave.
We make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone. Dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head. Mam says, That driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard, God forgive me.
It's a long walk from the graveyard to our room. Mam tells Dad, These children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning. If you're thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it. We're taking them to Naughton's and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for 'tisn't every day they bury a brother.
The fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats.
When we get home the room is empty. There are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out. Dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by Eugene's head. You expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room, climbing up on the bed to look out the window for Oliver.
Dad tells Mam he's going out for a walk. She says no. She knows what he's up to, that he can't wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs. All right, he says. He lights the fire and Mam makes tea and soon we're in bed.
Malachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home
the money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them.
III
Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. She's happy they're chatting like that but she doesn't want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life. It's a shame to move when we're so near Leamy's National School but if she doesn't move soon she'll go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum.
We move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable.
Mam goes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to see if there's any chance of getting furniture. The man says he'll give us a docket for a table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we'll have to go to a second- hand furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds we're getting are secondhand. He says of course they are, and she says she's very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The man says, I'm very sorry, but beggars can't be choosers.
It takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of Limerick to the other. There are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety, it wants to go in a different direction. We have two beds, one sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs. We're happy with the house. We can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs. You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please. Dad lights the fire and Mam makes the tea. He sits at the table on one chair, she sits on the other and Malachy and I sit on the trunk we brought from America. While we're drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand. He empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and there's a powerful stink in our kitchen. Mam goes to the door and says, Why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory? He raises his cap to her. Your lavatory, missus? Ah, no. You're making a bit of a mistake there, ha, ha. This is not your lavatory. Sure, isn't this the lavatory for the whole lane. You'll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and I can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather, very powerful altogether. 'Tis December now, thank God, with a chill in the air and Christmas around the corner and the lavatory isn't that bad, but the day will come when you'll be calling for a gas mask. So, good night to you, missus, and I hope you'll be happy in your house.
Mam says, Wait a minute, sir. Could you tell me who cleans this lavatory?
Cleans? Ah, Jasus, that's a good one. Cleans, she says. Is it joking you are? These houses were built in the time of Queen Victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin'.
And he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself.
Mam comes back to her chair and her tea. We can't stay here, she says. That lavatory will kill us with all diseases.
Dad says, We can't move again. Where will we get a house for six shillings a week? We'll keep the lavatory clean ourselves. We'll boil buckets of water and throw them in there.
Oh, will we? says Mam, and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water?
Dad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture. The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was a Pope, Leo the Thirteenth, a great friend of the workingman. He brought this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he's talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn't say bloody in front of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he's going to get it into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you don't go around borrowing from people you don't know. He leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar. The jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope's head. He wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells Mam, Quick, quick, wipe the blood off the Pope before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it's wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope's face is smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you've destroyed the Pope entirely, and she says, Arrah, stop your whining, we'll get some paint and go over his face some day, and Dad says, He's the only Pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the St. Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over him? Mam says, I don't know. It's your blood and 'tis a sad thing when a man can't even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless you are. You'd be better off digging fields and anyway I don't care. I have pain in my back and I'm going to bed.
Och, what am I going to do? Dad says.
Take down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he won't be seen and he'll be out of harm's way.
I can't, says Dad. It would be bad luck. Coal hole is no place for a Pope. When the Pope is up, he's up.
Suit yourself, says Mam.
I will, says Dad.
This is our first Christmas in Limerick and the girls are out in
the lane, skipping rope and singing, Christmas is coming And the goose is getting fat, Please put a penny In the old man's hat.
If you haven't a penny
A ha'penny will do
And if you haven't a ha'penny
God bless you.
Boys tease the girls and call out,
May your mother have an accident
Abroad in the loo.
Mam says she'd like to have a nice Christmas dinner but what can you do when the Labour Exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after Oliver and Eugene died? You pay the rent of six shillings, you have ten shillings left, and what use is that to four people?
Dad can't get any work. He gets up early on weekdays, lights the fire, boils water for the tea and his shaving mug. He puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs. He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange to sign for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie. A man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself. You never know when the clerk at the Labour Exchange might tell you there's a job going at Rank's Flour Mills or the Limerick Cement Company, and even if it's a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie?
Bosses and foremen always show him respect and say they're ready to hire him, but when he opens his mouth and they hear the North of Ireland accent, they take a Limerickman instead. That's what he tells Mam by the fire and when she says, Why don't you dress like a proper workingman? he says he'll never give an inch, never let them know, and when she says, Why can't you try to talk like a Limerickman? he says he'll never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the Limerick accent. She says, Sorry for your troubles and I hope that's all you'll ever have, and he says that some day, with God's help, we'll get out of Limerick and far from the Shannon that kills.
I ask Dad what afflicted means and he says, Sickness, son, and things that don't fit.
When he's not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he's not home when the Angelus rings at six o'clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he'll never bring home anything because he'd never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says 'tis all right for her to be begging at the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can't stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it's different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you.
When the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she'll brain him with the poker.
You wouldn't do that, Angela.
I would and more. You better stop the nonsense and go to bed.
Bed, bed, bed. What's the use of going to bed? If I go to bed I'll
only have to get up again and I can't sleep in a place where there's a river sending poison to us in mist and fog.
He goes to bed, pounds the wall with his fist, sings a woeful song, falls asleep. He's up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn. He wakes Malachy and me and we're tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing. We complain and say we're sick, we're tired, but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor. It's December and it's freezing and we can see our breath. We pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire Dad has already started. We wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door. The pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail. Everything around the tap is damp, the floor, the wall, the chair the basin sits on. The water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb. Dad says this is good for us, it will make men of us. He throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show there's nothing to fear. We hold our hands to the fire for the heat that's in it but we can't stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school. Dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because God is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where we'll never have to worry about the cold again.
And he smiles.
Two weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty. The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven't moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling with the damp. There's a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad and Mam and the missing furniture. It's nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door. They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in. People emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen. She thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain. We'll be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor. Dad says it's like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like Italy. That's what we'll call the upstairs from now on, Italy. Malachy says the Pope is still on the wall downstairs and he's going to be all cold and couldn't we bring him up? but Mam says, No, he's going to stay where he is because I don't want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed. Isn't it enough that we dragged him all the way from Brooklyn to Belfast to Dublin to Limerick? All I want now is a little peace, ease and comfort....
Mam takes Malachy and me to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to stand in the queue and see if there's any chance of getting something for the Christmas dinner-a goose or a ham, but the man says everyone in
Limerick is desperate this Christmas. He gives her a docket for groceries at McGrath's shop and another one for the butcher.
No goose, says the butcher, no ham. No fancy items when you bring the docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. What you can have now, missus, is black pudding and tripe or a sheep's head or a nice pig's head. No harm in a pig's head, missus, plenty of meat and children love it, slice that cheek, slather it with mustard and you're in heaven, though I suppose they wouldn't have the likes of that in America where they're mad for the steak and all classes of poultry, flying, walking or swimming itself.
He tells Mam, no, she can't have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense she'll take the pig's head before they're all gone the way the poor people of Limerick are clamoring for them.
Mam says the pig's head isn't right for Christmas and he says 'tis more than the Holy Family had in that cold stable in Bethlehem long ago. You wouldn't find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pig's head.
No, they wouldn't complain, says Mam, but they'd never eat the pig's head. They were Jewish.
And what does that have to do with it? A pig's head is a pig's head.
And a Jew is a Jew and 'tis against their religion and I don't blame them.
The butcher says, Are you a bit of an expert, missus, on the Jews and the pig.
I am not, says Mam, but there was a Jewish woman, Mrs. Leibowitz, in New York, and I don't know what we would have done without her.
The butcher takes the pig's head off a shelf and when Malachy says, Ooh, look at the dead dog, the butcher and Mam burst out laughing. He wraps the head in newspaper, hands it to Mam and says, Happy Christmas. Then he wraps up some sausages and tells her, Take these sausages for your breakfast on Christmas Day. Mam says, Oh, I can't afford sausages, and he says, Am I asking you for money? Am I? Take these sausages. They might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham.
Sure, you don't have to do that, says Mam.
I know that, missus. If I had to do it, I wouldn't.
Mam says she has a pain in her back, that I'll have to carry the
pig's head. I hold it against my chest but it's damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head. Mam says, I'm ashamed of me life that the world should know we're having pig's head for Christmas. Boys from Leamy's National School see me and they point and laugh. Aw, Gawd, look at Frankie McCourt an'his pig's snout. Is that what the Yanks ate for Christmas dinner, Frankie?
One calls to another, Hey, Christy, do you know how to ate a pig's
head?
No, I don't, Paddy.
Grab him by the ears an' chew the face offa him.
And Christy says, Hey, Paddy, do you know the only part of the pig the McCourts don't ate?
No, I don't, Christy.
The only part they don't ate is the oink.
After a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone
can see the pig's head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he's dead and the world is
laughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone laughed at them I'd hit them with a rock.
I wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall. She's holding her back and telling us she'll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he wouldn't be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity. That's what he says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig's head. He tells Malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things.
He's upstairs sitting by the fire, smoking a cigarette, reading The Irish Press, which he loves because it's De Valera's paper and he thinks De Valera is the greatest man in the world. He looks at me and the pig's head and tells Mam it's a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of Limerick. She takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next Christmas he can go out and find the dinner. She's worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs, boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death.
On Christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea. Mam sends me to Grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pig's head. Grandma says, What are ye having for yeer dinner? Pig's head! Jesus, Mary an' Joseph, that's goin' beyond the beyonds. Couldn't your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? What kind of man is he at all, at all?
Mam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the Redemptorist church. It's warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. He's a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that's Jesus' mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old man with the beard. He says they're sad because they know Jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can't ask questions like that. Malachy says, Why? and Dad tells him be quiet.
Mam is in a terrible state at home. There isn't enough coal to cook the dinner, the water isn't boiling anymore and she says she's demented with worry. We'll have to go down the Dock Road again to see if there's any coal or turf lying around from the lorries. Surely we'll find something on the road this day of all days. Even the poorest of the poor don't go out on Christmas Day picking coal off the road. There's no use asking Dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he won't carry things through the streets. It's a rule he has. Mam can't go because of the pain in her back.
She says, You'll have to go, Frank, and take Malachy with you.
It's a long way to the Dock Road but we don't mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and it's not raining. We carry a canvas bag Mam borrowed from Mrs. Hannon next door and Mam is right, there is no one on the Dock Road. The poor are all at home having pig's head or maybe a goose and we have the Dock Road to ourselves. We find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards. We find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again. We're wandering around trying to fill the bag
when Pa Keating comes along. He must have washed himself for Christmas because he's not as black as he was when Eugene died. He wants to know what we're doing with that bag and when Malachy tells him he says, Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! Christmas Day and ye don't have a fire for yeer pig's head. That's a bloody disgrace.
He takes us to South's pub, which is not supposed to be open, but he's a regular customer and there's a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the Baby Jesus above in the crib. He orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if there's any chance of getting a few lumps of coal. The man says he's been serving drink for twenty-seven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before. Pa says it would be a favor and the man says if Pa asked for the moon he'd fly up and bring it back. The man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry. It's real coal and not bits from the Dock Road and if we can't carry it we can drag it along the ground.
It takes us a long time to go from South's pub to Barrack Hill because of a hole in the bag. I pull the bag and it's Malachy's job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again. Then it starts to rain and we can't stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and it's leaving a black trail along the pavement and Malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps, pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands. I tell him he's black, he tells me I'm black, and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door, 'tis Christmas Day and she doesn't want to be looking at Africa.
We have to keep dragging the bag or we'll never have our Christmas dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot. We drag the bag up O'Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us, Look at the Zulus. Where are yeer spears?
Malachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but I tell him if he throws coal there's less for the pig and we'll never get our dinner.
The downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesn't matter because we're drenched anyway and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to Italy. He says we're good boys for getting so much coal, that the Dock Road must have been covered with it. When Mam sees us she starts to laugh, and then she cries. She's laughing because we're so black and crying because we're sopping wet. She tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces. She tells Dad the pig's head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea.
It's raining outside and there's a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in Italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that, after our tea, Malachy and I doze off in the bed and we don't wake till Dad tells us the dinner is ready. Our clothes are still wet, so Malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in Mam's red American overcoat and I'm wrapped in an old coat that Mam's father left behind when he went to Australia.
There are delicious smells in the room, cabbage, potatoes, and the pig's head, but when Dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate Malachy says, Oh, the poor pig. I don't want to eat the poor pig.
Mam says, If you were hungry you'd eat it. Now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner.
Dad says, Wait a minute. He takes slices from the two cheeks, places them on our plates and smears them with mustard. He takes the plate that holds the pig's head and puts it on the floor under the table. Now, he says to Malachy, that's ham, and Malachy eats it because he's not looking at what it came from and it isn't pig's head anymore. The cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt. Mam peels our potatoes but Dad eats his skin and all. He says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and Mam says it's a good thing he's not eating eggs, he'd be chewing the shells and all.
He says he would, and it's a disgrace that the Irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and that's why thousands are dying of consumption and surely there's nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin. If he had his way, and Mam says, Never mind your way. Eat your dinner.
He eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot. He eats a small slice of the pig's cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for Malachy and me. He makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didn't have a sweet on Christmas Day.
It's dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where Mam and Dad sit and smoke their cigarettes. There's nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where it's cozy and your father can tell you a story about how Cuchulain became a Catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the Redemptorist church crying because he and the Baby Jesus and Cuchulain all have to grow up and die.
The angel that brought Margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother, Michael. Dad says he found Michael on the seventh step of the stairs to Italy. He says that's what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby, the Angel on the Seventh Step.
Malachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the Angel on the Seventh Step if you don't have any stairs in your house and Dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction.
Malachy wants to know what an affliction is.
Affliction. I'd like to know what that word means. Affliction, but Dad says, Och, child, the world is an affliction and everything in it, puts on his cap and goes to the Bedford Row Hospital to see Mam and Michael. She's in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step. I don't understand this because I'm sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step. There's no use asking Dad or Mam about this. They say, You're getting as bad as your brother for asking questions. Go play.
I know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head.
Dad brings Mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back. She says this baby is the
spitting image of our sister who died, with his wavy black hair, his lovely blue eyes, and the gorgeous eyebrows. That's what Mam says.
I want to know if the baby will be spitting. I also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and I'd like to know if you count from the bottom or the top. Dad doesn't mind answering this question. Angels come down from above, he says, and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from October till April.
So I find the seventh step by counting from the top.
The baby Michael has a cold. His head is stuffed and he can barely breathe. Mam worries because it's Sunday and the Dispensary for the poor is closed. If you go to the doctor's house and the maid sees you're from the lower classes she tells you go to the Dispensary where you belong. If you tell her the child is dying in your arms she'll say the doctor is in the country riding his horse.
Mam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth. She tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but she's afraid to push it too far up. Dad says, There's no need for that. You're not supposed to be pushing things inside a child's head. It looks like he's going to kiss the baby. Instead, he has his mouth on the little nose and he's sucking sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head. He spits it into the fire, Michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing. Mam looks at Dad as if he just came down from heaven and Dad says, That's what we did in Antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses.
Michael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but Mam says it isn't enough and now she has to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for food. One night there is a knock on the door and Mam sends me down to see who it is. There are two men from the St. Vincent de Paul and they want to see my mother and father. I tell them my parents are upstairs in Italy and they say, What?
Upstairs where 'tis dry. I'll tell them.
They want to know what that little shed is beside our front door. I tell them it's the lavatory. They want to know why it isn't in the back of the house and I tell them it's the lavatory for the whole lane and it's a good thing it's not in the back of our house or we'd have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick.
They say, Are you sure there's one lavatory for the whole lane? I am.
They say, Mother of God.
Mam calls down from Italy. Who's down there?
The men.
What men? From the St. Vincent de Paul.
They're careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and
they make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another, Isn't this a disgrace? till they get upstairs to Italy. They tell Mam and Dad they're sorry to disturb them but the Society has to be sure they're helping deserving cases. Mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say, No, thank you. They want to know why we're living upstairs. They want to know about the lavatory. They ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks, especially when they're wearing collars and ties and suits. They ask how old Michael is, how much Dad gets at the Labour Exchange, when did he last have a job, why doesn't he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has?
Dad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease, that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry. He says the River Shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one.
Malachy tells them we're living in Italy and they smile.
Mam asks if there's any chance of getting boots for Malachy and me and they say she'll have to come down to Ozanam House and apply. She says she hasn't been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldn't be able to stand long in a queue, but they say everyone has to be treated the same, even a woman down in the Irishtown that had triplets and, thank you, we'll make our report to the Society.
When they're leaving Malachy wants to show them where the angel left Michael on the seventh step but Dad tells him, Not now, not now. Malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and I wish I had something to cry about so that I'd get a piece, too.
I have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry. They keep shaking their heads and saying, God Almighty and Mother of God, this is desperate. That's not Italy they have upstairs, that's Calcutta.
Dad is telling Mam up in Italy she should never beg like that. What do you mean, beg?
Don't you have any pride, begging for boots like that?
And what would you do, Mr. Grand Manner? Would you let them go
barefoot?
I'd rather fix the shoes they have.
The shoes they have are falling to pieces.
I can fix them, he says.
You can't fix anything. You're useless, she says.
He comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire. He sends me to
Mr. Hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer. He takes Mam's sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes. Mam tells him he's going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer, driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes. Mam says, God above, if you left the shoes alone they'd last till Easter, at least, and we might get the boots from the St. Vincent de Paul. But he won't stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind. He makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we don't want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around Italy. He sends me back to Mr. Hannon with the last and hammer and Mrs. Hannon says, God above, what's up with your shoes? She laughs and Mr. Hannon shakes his head and I feel ashamed. I don't want to go to school next day and I pretend to be sick but Dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all, that there are boys in Leamy's National School who go to school barefoot on bitter days. On our way to school Leamy's boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say, How's the air up there? There are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they don't say anything and I wonder if it's better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot. If you have no shoes at all you'll have all the barefoot boys on your side. If you have rubber tires on your shoes
you're all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles. I sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are. He knows I'm not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on. Then he says to the class, There is sneering here. There is jeering at the misfortunes of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he's perfect? Raise your hands.
There are no hands. Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands.
There are no hands.
He says, There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can. There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It's not their fault and it's no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys?
No, sir.
What is it you don't see Our Lord doing?
Hanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir.
Now if I hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at
McCourt or his brother over their
will come out, boys?
The stick, sir.
The stick will sting, boys.
air, it will land on the backside
sneers. Where will it land, boys?
shoes the stick will come out. What
The ash plant will whistle through the
of the boy that jeers, the boy that
On the boy that jeers, sir.
And?
The boy that sneers, sir.
The boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber
tires the few weeks to Easter when the St. Vincent de Paul Society gives us the gift of boots.
If I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket I go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step. Sometimes I'm sure there's a light there and if everyone's asleep I sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit. I ask Mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them. She says, Of course not. The angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy.
I could ask the angel all kinds of questions and I'm sure he'd answer, unless it's a girl angel. But I'm sure a girl angel would answer questions, too. I never heard anyone say they didn't.
I sit on the seventh step a long time and I'm sure the angel is there. I tell him all the things you can't tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play. I tell him all about school and how I'm afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in Irish and I still don't know what he's talking about because I came from America and the other boys were learning Irish a year before me.
I stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or Dad gets up and tells me go back to bed. He's the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and you'd think he'd know why I'm sitting there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he said, Och, now, Francis, you're a bit of a dreamer.
I get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother. The poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel.
He laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn't it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child.
Before Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with the damp, and the kitchen isn't a lake anymore, and if we're up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window.
In fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them, looking at the world and watching us play. Women stand with their arms folded, chatting. They don't sit because all they do is stay at home, take care of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs. The men sit because they're worn out from walking to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, discussing the world's problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie Library reading English and Irish newspapers. A man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on what's going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible state of the Chinese millions. A man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world.
Easter is better than Christmas because Dad takes us to the Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing. They're happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there He is, hanging on the cross. I don't understand how He grew up so fast that He's hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near His belly.
Dad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything.
At the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths. They come back to their seats with their heads down, their mouths moving. Malachy says he's hungry and he wants some, too. Dad says, Shush, that's Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our Lord.
But, Dad.
Shush, it's a mystery.
There's no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they
tell you it's a mystery, you'll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o' Jesus leave me alone, go out and play.
Dad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam is happy. She won't have to stand in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says it's not begging, it's charity, but Dad says it's begging and shameful. Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen O'Connell's shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own mother.
The cement factory is miles outside Limerick and that means Dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning. He doesn't mind because he's used to the long walks. The night before Mam makes him a flask of tea, a sandwich, a hard-boiled egg. She feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back. A bicycle would be handy but you'd have to be working a year for the price of it.
Friday is payday and Mam is out of the bed early, cleaning the house and singing.
Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this...
There isn't much to clean in the house. She sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of Italy upstairs. She washes the four jam jars we use for mugs. She says if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine. She boils water and washes the rags that keep Michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself. Oh, she says, we'll have a lovely tea when your Pop brings home the wages tonight.
Pop. She's in a good mood.
Sirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at half-past five. Malachy and I are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the Friday Penny. We know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and buy sweets. If your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the Lyric Cinema the next day to see a film with James Cagney.
The men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper, wash themselves and go to the pub. The women go to the films at the Coliseum or the Lyric Cinema. They buy sweets and Wild Woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of Black Magic chocolates. They love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when there's an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by Hindus and other non-Catholics.
We have to wait a long time for Dad to walk the miles from the cement factory. We can't have our tea till he's home and that's very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane. Mam says it's a good thing payday is Friday when you can't eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind. We can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want?
The women are gone to the cinemas, the men are in the pubs, and still Dad isn't home. Mam says it's a long way to the cement factory even if he's a fast walker. She says that but her eyes are watery and she's not singing anymore. She's sitting by the fire smoking a Wild Woodbine she got on credit from Kathleen O'Connell. The fag is the only luxury she has and she'll never forget Kathleen for her goodness. She doesn't know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle. There's no use making the tea till Dad gets home because it will be stewed, coddled, boiled and unfit to drink. Malachy says he's hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going. She says, This job could be
the saving of us. 'Tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one I don't know what we're going to do.
The darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle. She has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because we're so hungry we can't wait another minute. She sits at the table, eats a bit of bread and cheese, smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we'll all go back to America and we'll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door.
The women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there's no use waiting up any longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed with Michael in her arms. It's quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in the distance, my father.
I know it's my father because he's the only one in Limerick who sings that song from the North, Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over Kevin Barry. People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, For Jasus' sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning for work. Go home and sing your feckin' patriotic songs.
He stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, he's ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious Saxons.
He's pushing in our door and singing,
And if, when all a vigil keep,
The West's asleep, the West's asleep! Alas! and well my Erin weep,
That Connacht lies in slumber deep,
But hark! a voice like thunder spake 'The West's awake! the West's awake! Sing, Oh, hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!'
He calls from the bottom of the stairs, Angela, Angela, is there a drop of tea in this house?
She doesn't answer and he calls again, Francis, Malachy, come down here, boys. I have the Friday Penny for you.
I want to go down and get the Friday Penny but Mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and Malachy says, I don't want his old Friday Penny. He can keep it.
Dad is stumbling up the stairs, making a speech about how we all have to die for Ireland. He lights a match and touches it to the candle by Mam's bed. He holds the candle over his head and marches around the room, singing, See who comes over the red-blossomed heather, Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air, Heads erect, eyes to front,
stepping proudly together, Sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there.
Michael wakes and lets out a loud cry, the Hannons are banging on the wall next door, Mam is telling Dad he's a disgrace and why doesn't he get out of the house altogether.
He stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head. He pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to Malachy and me. Your Friday Penny, boys, he says. I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday Penny.
Malachy sits up in the bed. I don't want it, he says.
And I tell him I don't want it, either.
Dad stands for a minute, swaying, and puts the penny back in his
pocket. He turns toward Mam and she says, You're not sleeping in this bed tonight. He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement factory, and we're back on the dole again.
IV
The master says it's time to prepare for First Confession and First Communion, to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism, to become good Catholics, to know the difference between right and wrong, to die for the Faith if called on.
The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.
The master says we're each to bring threepence for the First Communion catechism with the green cover. The catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive First Communion. Older boys in the fifth class have the thick Confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence. I'd love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big people who haven't died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you're told go out and play.
It's very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. He's eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction means. Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books. He's the expert in the lane on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General and he promises, I'll tell you everything, Frankie, when you're eleven like me and you're not so thick and ignorant.
It's a good thing he says Frankie so I'll know he's talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who he's looking at. If he's talking to Malachy and I think he's talking to me he might go into a
rage and have a fit that will carry him off. He says it's a gift to have crossed eyes because you're like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient Roman times you had no problem getting a good job. If you look at pictures of Roman emperors you'll see there's always a great hint of crossed eyes. When he's not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the Carnegie Library. His mother says books books books, he's ruining his eyes with the reading, he needs an operation to straighten them but who'll pay for it. She tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes they'll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head. Ever after his father calls him Cyclops, who is in a Greek story.
Nora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub. He knows the names of all the Popes from St. Peter to Pius the Eleventh. He's only eleven but he's a man, oh, a man indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and down the Dock Road he'll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more. He'll run messages for old people who can't walk and if they don't have a penny to give him a prayer will do.
If he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves her Mikey. He is her world, her heart's blood, her pulse, and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key.
Mikey's father, Peter, is a great champion. He wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone. All he has to do is go out to the jakes, stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round. Peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger. He's such a champion they could chop off his fingers and he'd carry on regardless. He wins all that money but doesn't bring it home. Sometimes he's like my father and drinks the dole itself and that's why Nora Molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family. She knows as long as you're in the asylum you're safe from the world and its torments, there's nothing you can do, you're protected, and what's the use of worrying. It's well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but she's the only one that has to be dragged out, back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers.
You can tell when Nora Molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe. That happens when Peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away. You know she's inside frantic with the baking. She wants to make sure the children won't starve while she's gone and she roams Limerick begging for flour. She goes to priests, nuns, Protestants, Quakers. She goes to Rank's Flour Mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor. She bakes day and night. Peter begs her to stop but she screams, This is what comes of drinking the dole. He tells her the bread will only go stale. There's no use talking to her. Bake bake bake. If she had the money she'd bake all the flour in Limerick and regions beyond. If the men didn't come from the lunatic asylum to take her away she'd bake till she fell to the floor.
The children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say they're looking like loaves. Still the bread goes stale and Mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding. He boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if that's all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum.
My father says, Do they take her away because she's gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because they're taking her away?
Nora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside. She always says, Where's Mikey? Is he alive? She worries over Mikey because he's not a proper Catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life. He's not a proper Catholic because he could never receive his First Communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him. The master tried over and over with bits of the Limerick Leader but Mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest, who wrote to the bishop, who said, Don't bother me, handle it yourself. The master sent a note home saying Mikey was to practice receiving Communion with his father or mother but even they couldn't get him to swallow a piece of the Limerick Leader in the shape of a wafer. They even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use. The priest tells Mrs. Molloy not to worry. God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform and surely He has a special purpose for Mikey, fits and all. She says, Isn't it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of Our Lord he goes into a fit? Isn't that remarkable? She worries Mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows he's an angel out of heaven. Mikey tells her God is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it. What kind of a God would do a thing like that?
Are you sure, Mikey?
I am. I read it in a book.
He sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over
his First Communion day, which was all a cod. He couldn't swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around Limerick in his little black suit for The Collection? She said to Mikey, Well, I'm not lying so I'm not. I'm only saying to the neighbors, Here's Mikey in his First Communion suit. That's all I'm saying, mind you. Here's Mikey. If they think you swallied your First Communion who am I to contradict them and disappoint them? Mikey's father said, Don't worry, Cyclops. You have loads of time. Jesus didn't become a proper Catholic till he took the bread and wine at the Last Supper and He was thirty-three years of age. Nora Molloy said, Will you stop calling him Cyclops? He has two eyes in his head and he's not a Greek. But Mikey's father, champion of all pint drinkers, is like my uncle Pa Keating, he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what the world says and that's the way I'd like to be myself.
Mikey tells me the best thing about First Communion is The Collection. Your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the Lyric Cinema to see Charlie Chaplin.
What about James Cagney?
Never mind James Cagney. Lots of blather. Charlie Chaplin is your only man. But you have to be with your mother on The Collection. The grown-up people of Limerick are not going to be handing out money to
every little Tom Dick and Mick with a First Communion suit that doesn't have his mother with him.
Mikey got over five shillings on his First Communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the Lyric Cinema and Frank Goggin, the ticket man, kicked him out. He says he didn't care because he had money left over and went to the Savoy Cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate Cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile. He can't wait for Confirmation day because you're older, there's another collection and that brings more money than First Communion. He'll go to the cinema the rest of his life, sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert. He loves his mother but he'll never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum. What's the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who don't care what they do because they already did it with their brothers. If you don't get married you won't have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes. When he's older he'll go to the pub like his father, drink pints galore, stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up, drink more pints, win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented.
He says he's not a proper Catholic which means he's doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes. He says, I'll tell you more when you grow up, Frankie. You're too young now and you don't know your arse from your elbow.
The master, Mr. Benson, is very old. He roars and spits all over us every day. The boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for it's the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left. He tells us we have to know the catechism backwards, forwards and sideways. We have to know the Ten Commandments, the Seven Virtues, Divine and Moral, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deadly Sins. We have to know by heart all the prayers, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, the Confiteor, the Apostles' Creed, the Act of Contrition, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have to know them in Irish and English and if we forget an Irish word and use English he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick. If he had his way we'd be learning our religion in Latin, the language of the saints who communed intimately with God and His Holy Mother, the language of the early Christians, who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword, who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion. Irish is fine for patriots, English for traitors and informers, but it's the Latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself. It's the Latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch. He tells us we're a disgrace to Ireland and her long sad history, that we'd be better off in Africa praying to bush or tree. He tells us we're hopeless, the worst class he ever had for First Communion but as sure as God made little apples he'll make Catholics of us, he'll beat the idler out of us and the Sanctifying Grace into us.
Brendan Quigley raises his hand. We call him Question Quigley because he's always asking questions. He can't help himself. Sir, he says, what's Sanctifying Grace?
The master rolls his eyes to heaven. He's going to kill Quigley. Instead he barks at him, Never mind what's Sanctifying Grace, Quigley. That's none of your business. You're here to learn the catechism and do
what you're told. You're not here to be asking questions. There are too many people wandering the world asking questions and that's what has us in the state we're in and if I find any boy in this class asking questions I won't be responsible for what happens. Do you hear me, Quigley?
I do.
I do what?
I do, sir.
He goes on with his speech, There are boys in this class who will
never know the Sanctifying Grace. And why? Because of the greed. I have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about First Communion day, the happiest day of your life. Are they talking about receiving the body and blood of Our Lord? Oh, no. Those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money they'll get, The Collection. They'll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for The Collection. And will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in Africa? Will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the True Faith? Little black babies denied knowledge of the Mystical Body of Christ? Limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because they'll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of Our Lord and the glorious company of saints, martyrs, virgins. Oh, no. It's off to the cinemas, our First Communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devil's henchmen in Hollywood. Isn't that right, McCourt?
'Tis, sir.
Question Quigley raises his hand again. There are looks around the room and we wonder if it's suicide he's after.
What's henchmen, sir?
The master's face goes white, then red. His mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere. He walks to Question and drags him from his seat. He snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room. He flogs Question across the shoulders, the bottom, the legs. He grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room.
Look at this specimen, he roars.
Question is shaking and crying. I'm sorry, sir.
The master mocks him. I'm sorry, sir. What are you sorry for? I'm sorry I asked the question. I'll never ask a question again,
sir.
The day you do, Quigley, will be the day you wish God would take
you to His bosom. What will you wish, Quigley?
That God will take me to His bosom, sir.
Go back to your seat, you omadhaun, you poltroon, you thing from
the far dark corner of a bog.
He sits down with the stick before him on the desk. He tells
Question to stop the whimpering and be a man. If he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about The Collection again he'll flog that boy till the blood spurts.
what?
What will I do, boys?
Flog the boy, sir.
Till?
Till the blood spurts, sir.
Now, Clohessy, what is the Sixth Commandment?
Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery
Thou shalt not commit adultery, sir.
And what is adultery, Clohessy?
Impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, sir.
Good, Clohessy. You're a good boy. You may be slow and forgetful in
the sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but you're powerful with the Sixth Commandment and that will keep you pure.
Paddy Clohessy has no shoe to his foot, his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away, his eyes are red, his nose always snotty. The sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth. His clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning. He hates school. He's seven going on eight, the biggest and oldest boy in the class, and he can't wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the English army and go to India where it's nice and warm and he'll live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and he'll be lying there eating figs, that's what they eat in India, figs, and she'll cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money he'll send for the whole family and they'll all live in the tent especially his poor father who's at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption. When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd surely be put in the middle of it.
I think Paddy likes me because of the raisin and I feel a bit guilty because I wasn't that generous in the first place. The master, Mr. Benson, said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldn't have to be going home in the freezing weather. He led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of Leamy's School where the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun. The milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs. The boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared, Any more of that talk and I'll warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads. We all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but Nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and she'd inquire from the man who delivered. We searched again every day till at last I found a raisin in my bun and held it up. The boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and Nellie said it wasn't her fault. She'd ask the man again. Now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything, a slug of their milk, a pencil, a comic book. Toby Mackey said I could have his sister and Mr. Benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled. I wanted the raisin for myself but I saw Paddy Clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and I always felt sad over kicked dogs so I walked over and gave Paddy the raisin because I didn't know what else to do and all the boys yelled that I was a fool and a feckin' eejit and I'd regret the day and after I handed the raisin to Paddy I longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and I said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin.
Mr. Benson gave me a look and said nothing and Nellie Ahearn said, You're a great oul'Yankee, Frankie.
The priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else. The master himself has to show us how to receive Holy
Communion. He tells us gather round him. He fills his hat with the Limerick Leader torn into little bits. He gives Paddy Clohessy the hat, kneels on the floor, tells Paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue. He shows us how to stick out the tongue, receive the bit of paper, hold it a moment, draw in the tongue, fold your hands in prayer, look toward heaven, close your eyes in adoration, wait for the paper to melt in your mouth, swallow it, and thank God for the gift, the Sanctifying Grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity. When he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before. He opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he can't say anything because he still has God on his tongue and it's a holy moment. He gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the Holy Communion practice. He goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in Latin. Some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesn't stop it's not Holy Communion they'll be getting but the Last Rites and what is that sacrament called, McCourt?
Extreme Unction, sir.
That's right, McCourt. Not bad for a Yank from the sinful shores of Amerikay.
He tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the Communion wafer won't fall to the floor. He says, That's the worst thing that can happen to a priest. If the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees, pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another. The priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and that's enough to choke you and kill you entirely.
He tells us that next to a relic of the True Cross the Communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our First Communion is the holiest moment in our lives. Talking about First Communion makes the master all excited. He paces back and forth, waves his stick, tells us we must never forget that the moment the Holy Communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation, the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church, that for two thousand years men, women and children have died for the Faith, that the Irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department. Haven't we provided martyrs galore? Haven't we bared our necks to the Protestant ax? Haven't we mounted the scaffold, singing, as if embarking on a picnic, haven't we, boys?
We have, sir.
What have we done, boys?
Bared our necks to the Protestant ax, sir.
And?
Mounted the scaffold singing, sir.
As if?
Embarking on a picnic, sir.
He says that, perhaps, in this class there is a future priest or a
martyr for the Faith, though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach.
But it takes all kinds, he says, and surely God had some purpose when He sent the likes of ye to infest this earth. Surely God had a purpose when among us He sent Clohessy with no shoes, Quigley with his damnable questions and McCourt heavy with sin from America. And remember
this, boys, God did not send His only begotten Son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer First Communion day with the paws clutching for The Collection. Our Lord died so that ye might be redeemed. It is enough to receive the gift of Faith. Are ye listening to me?
We are, sir.
And what's enough?
The gift of Faith, sir.
Good. Go home.
At night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the
lane reading, Mikey, Malachy and I. The Molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books. His father, Peter, brings books from the Carnegie Library so that he'll have something to do when he's not drinking pints or when he's looking after the family anytime Mrs. Molloy is in the lunatic asylum. He lets Mikey read any book he likes and now Mikey is reading this book about Cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him. I want to tell him I knew all about Cuchulain when I was three going on four, that I saw Cuchulain in Dublin, that Cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams. I want to tell him stop talking about Cuchulain, he's mine, he was mine years ago when I was young, but I can't because Mikey reads us a story I never heard of before, a dirty story about Cuchulain which I can never tell my father or mother, the story of how Emer became Cuchulain's wife.
Cuchulain was getting to be an old man of twenty-one. He was lonely and wanted to get married, which made him weak, says Mikey, and got him killed in the end. All the women in Ireland were mad about Cuchulain and they wanted to marry him. He said that would be grand, he wouldn't mind marrying all the women of Ireland. If he could fight all the men of Ireland why couldn't he marry all the women? But the King, Conor MacNessa, said, That's all very well for you, Cu, but the men of Ireland don't want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night. The King decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry Cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest. All the women of Ireland assembled on the plains of Muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was Emer. She was the champion woman pisser of Ireland and married Cuchulain and that's why to this day she is called Great Bladdered Emer.
Mikey and Malachy laugh over this story though I don't think Malachy understands it. He's young and far from his First Communion and he's only laughing over the piss word. Then Mikey tells me I've committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when I go to my First Confession I'll have to tell the priest. Malachy says, That's right. Piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because 'tis a sin word.
I don't know what to do. How can I go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my First Confession? All the boys know what sins they're going to tell so that they'll get the First Communion and make The Collection and go to see James Cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the Lyric Cinema. The master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins. I hit my brother. I told a lie. I stole a penny from my mother's purse. I disobeyed my parents, I ate a sausage on Friday.
But now I have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know I listened to a story about
Cuchulain's wife being the champion woman pisser in all Ireland. I'll never be able to make my First Communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say, Look at him. He's like Mikey Molloy, never made his First Communion, wandering around in a state of sin, never made The Collection, never saw James Cagney.
I'm sorry I ever heard of First Communion and The Collection. I'm sick and I don't want any tea or bread or anything. Mam tells Dad it's a strange thing when a child won't have his bread and tea and Dad says, Och, he's just nervous over the First Communion. I want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me but I'm too big to be sitting on laps and if I did Malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone I was a big baby. I'd like to tell my troubles to the Angel on the Seventh Step but he's busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world. Still, I'll ask Dad.
Dad, does the Angel on the Seventh Step have other jobs besides bringing babies?
He does.
Would the Angel on the Seventh Step tell you what to do if you didn't know what to do?
Och, he would, son, he would. That's the job of an angel, even the one on the seventh step.
Dad goes for a long walk, Mam takes Michael and goes to see Grandma, Malachy plays in the lane, and I have the house to myself so that I can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel. I know he's there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and there's a light in my head. I tell him my troubles and I hear a voice. Fear not, says the voice.
He's talking backward and I tell him I don't know what he's talking about.
Do not fear, says the voice. Tell the priest your sin and you'll be forgiven.
Next morning I'm up early and drinking tea with Dad and telling him about the Angel on the Seventh Step. He places his hand on my forehead to see if I'm feeling all right. He asks if I'm sure I had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say?
I tell him the voice said Fear not and that means Do not fear.
Dad tells me the angel is right, I shouldn't be afraid, and I tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me. I tell him all about Great Bladdered Emer and I even use the piss word because the angel said, Fear not. Dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand. Och, och, och, he says, and I wonder if he's going demented like Mrs. Molloy, in and out of the lunatic asylum, but he says, Is that what you were worried about last night?
I tell him it is and he says it's not a sin and I don't have to tell the priest.
But the Angel on the Seventh Step said I should.
All right. Tell the priest if you like but the Angel on the Seventh Step said that only because you didn't tell me first. Isn't it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head?
'Tis, Dad.
The day before First Communion the master leads us to St. Joseph's Church for First Confession. We march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of Limerick he'll kill us on the spot and send us to
hell bloated with sin. That doesn't stop the bragging about the big sins. Willie Harold is whispering about his big sin, that he looked at his sister's naked body. Paddy Hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunt's purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips. Question Quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats. I try to tell them about Cuchulain and Emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head.
We kneel in the pews by the confession box and I wonder if my Emer sin is as bad as looking at your sister's naked body because I know now that some things in the world are worse than others. That's why they have different sins, the sacrilege, the mortal sin, the venial sin. Then the masters and grown-up people in general talk about the unforgivable sin, which is a great mystery. No one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if you've committed it if you don't know what it is. If I tell a priest about Great Bladdered Emer and the pissing contest he might say that's the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and I'll be disgraced all over Limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till I'm worn out.
I try to listen to Willie's confession when he goes in but all I can hear is a hissing from the priest and when Willie comes out he's crying.
It's my turn. The confession box is dark and there's a big crucifix hanging over my head. I can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side. I wonder if there's any use trying to talk to the Angel on the Seventh Step. I know he's not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not.
The panel slides back before my face and the priest says, Yes, my child?
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my First Confession. Yes, my child, and what sins have you committed?
I told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother's
purse. I said a curse.
Yes, my child. Anything else?
I, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer.
Surely that's not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by
certain writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his King, Conor MacNessa.
'Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him.
How was that, my child?
She won him in a pissing contest.
There is heavy breathing. The priest has his hand over his mouth
and he's making choking sounds and talking to himself, Mother o' God. Who, who told you that story, my child?
Mikey Molloy, Father.
And where did he hear it?
He read it in a book, Father.
Ah, a book. Books can be dangerous for children, my child. Turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints. Think of St. Joseph, the Little Flower, the sweet and gentle St. Francis of Assisi, who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Will you do that, my child?
I will, Father.
Are there any other sins, my child?
No, Father.
For your penance say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and say a
special prayer for me.
I will. Father, was that the worst sin?
What do you mean?
Am I the worst of all the boys, Father?
No, my child, you have a long way to go. Now say an Act of
Contrition and remember Our Lord watches you every minute. God bless you, my child.
First Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema. The night before I was so excited I couldn't sleep till dawn. I'd still be sleeping if my grandmother hadn't come banging at the door.
Get up! Get up! Get that child outa the bed. Happiest day of his life an' him snorin' above in the bed.
I ran to the kitchen. Take off that shirt, she said. I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water. My mother scrubbed me, my grandmother scrubbed me. I was raw, I was red.
They dried me. They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt, the short pants, the white stockings, the black patent leather shoes. Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a picture of the Sacred Heart, with blood dripping from it, flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns.
Come here till I comb your hair, said Grandma. Look at that mop, it won't lie down. You didn't get that hair from my side of the family. That's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father. That's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians. If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you wouldn't have this standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair.
She spat twice on my head.
Grandma, will you please stop spitting on my head. If you have anything to say, shut up. A little spit won't kill you. Come on, we'll be late for the Mass.
We ran to the church. My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms. We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host, glaring at me. Then he placed on my tongue the wafer, the body and blood of Jesus. At last, at last.
It's on my tongue. I draw it back.
It stuck.
I had God glued to the roof of my mouth. I could hear the master's
voice, Don't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you'll roast in hell for eternity.
I tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me, Stop that clucking and get back to your seat.
God was good. He melted and I swallowed Him and now, at last, I was a member of the True Church, an official sinner.
When the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church, my mother with Michael in her arms, my grandmother. They each hugged me to their bosoms. They each told me it was the happiest day of my life. They each cried all over my head and after my grandmother's contribution that morning my head was a swamp.
Mam, can I go now and make The Collection?
She said, After you have a little breakfast.
No, said Grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a
proper First Communion breakfast at my house. Come on.
We followed her. She banged pots and rattled pans and complained
that the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call. I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away.
Go aisy with that sugar. Is it a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs?
The food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came.
Look at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard. What am I goin' to do? I'll take him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself.
She dragged me through the streets of Limerick. She told the neighbors and passing strangers about God in her backyard. She pushed me into the confession box.
In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's a day since my last confession.
A day? And what sins have you committed in a day, my child?
I overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother said I have standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up my First Communion breakfast. Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do.
The priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds.
Ah... ah... tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. Say a prayer for me and God bless you, my child.
Grandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. Grandma said, Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I'll tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in me backyard?
He said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. Holy water or ordinary water?
He didn't say, Grandma.
Well, go back and ask him.
But, Grandma...
She pushed me back into the confessional.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a minute since my last
confession.
A minute! Are you the boy that was just here?
I am, Father.
What is it now?
My grandma says, Holy water or ordinary water? Ordinary water, and
tell your grandmother not to be bothering me again.
I told her, Ordinary water, Grandma, and he said don't be bothering
him again.
Don't be bothering him again. That bloody ignorant bogtrotter.
I asked Mam, Can I go now and make The Collection? I want to see James Cagney.
Grandma said, You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because you're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground. Come on, go home.
Mam said, Wait a minute. That's my son. That's my son on his First Communion day. He's going to see James Cagney.
No he's not.
Yes he is.
Grandma said, Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will
save his Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul. Go ahead.
She pulled her shawl around her and walked away.
Mam said, God, it's getting very late for The Collection and you'll
never see James Cagney. We'll go to the Lyric Cinema and see if they'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit.
We met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street. He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying. Trying? he said. You don't have money?
I was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said, That's all right. I'll get you in. I'll create a diversion.
What's a diversion?
I have the money to go and when I get in I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream. I'll be watching the door and when I see you in I'll have a miraculous recovery. That's a diversion. That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.
Mam said, Oh, I don't know about that, Mikey. Wouldn't that be a sin and surely you wouldn't want Frank to commit a sin on his First Communion day.
Mikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasn't a proper Catholic anyway so it didn't matter. He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man, Frank Goggin, was so worried over Mikey he never noticed. It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door, shocking his poor old Irish mother, and that was the end of my First Communion day.

Grandma won't talk to Mam anymore because of what I did with God in her backyard. Mam doesn't talk to her sister, Aunt Aggie, or her brother Uncle Tom. Dad doesn't talk to anyone in Mam's family and they don't talk to him because he's from the North and he has the odd manner. No one talks to Uncle Tom's wife, Jane, because she's from Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam's brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he's simple, and he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and no one knows why. Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn't talk to him he wouldn't give a fiddler's fart anyway and that's why the men in South's pub call him a gas man.
That's the way I'd like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving a fiddler's fart, and that's what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step till I remember you're not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel.
Uncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we're not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking. They have a son and daughter, Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them but we don't know how not to talk to our cousins.
People in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice. There are people who don't talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families are known ever after as soupers. It's a terrible thing to be a souper because you're doomed forever to the souper part of hell. It's even worse to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them. A man who's discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you you're better off hanging at the end of a rope.
In every lane there's always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other. The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say, One word or look from you, you ma faced bitch, and I'll tear the countenance from the front of your head.
It's bad when Grandma won't talk to us because we can't run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk. There's no use going to Aunt Aggie. She'll only bite your head off. Go home, she'll say, and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of Limerick.
They say she's always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because she's always angry.
Mam is friendly with Bridey Hannon, who lives next door with her mother and father. Mam and Bridey talk all the time. When my father goes for his long walk Bridey comes in and she and Mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. If Mam has nothing in the house Bridey brings tea, sugar and milk. Sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and Mam says the tea is stewed, coddled and boiled.
Mam and Bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue. They talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things. We're not supposed to hear the secret things so we're told go out and play. I often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion I'm there. It might be lashing rain out but Mam says, Rain or no, out you go, and she'll tell us, If you see your father coming, run in and tell me. Mam says to Bridey, Did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him?
What poem, Angela?
'Tis called ""The Man from the North. "" I got this poem from Minnie MacAdorey in America.
I never heard that poem. Say it for me.
Mam says the poem but she laughs all through it and I don't know why, He came from the North so his words were few But his voice was kind and his heart was true.
And I knew by his eyes that no guile had he, So I married my man from the North Country.
Oh, Garryowen may be more gay
Than this quiet man from beside Lough Neagh And I know that the sun shines softly down
On the river that runs through my native town.
But there's not-and I say it with joy and with pride A better man in all Munster wide
And Limerick town has no happier hearth
Than mine has been with my man from the North.
I wish that in Limerick they only knew The kind kind neighbors I came unto. Small hate or scorn would there ever be Between the South and the North Country.
She always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard she's crying and I don't know why. She goes into hysterics when she says, And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North.
If he comes back early and sees Bridey in the kitchen the man from the North says, Gossip, gossip, gossip, and stands there with his cap on till she leaves.
Bridey's mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask Dad if he'll write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place. He sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says, Och, no, that's not what you want to say, and he writes what he feels like writing. The people tell him that's what they wanted to say in the first place, that he has a lovely way with the English language and a fine fist for the writing. They offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to Mam because he's too grand to be taking sixpence. When the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to Kathleen O'Connell's shop for cigarettes.
Grandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus over her head and a statue of the Sacred Heart on the mantel piece. She wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that she'll have a little red light under the statue forever. Her devotion to the Sacred Heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond.
Uncle Pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where Grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers. He might have been dropped on his head, he may not know how to read and write, he may drink one pint too many, but there's no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep.
Uncle Pat tells Grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two
meals a day, dinner and tea. His name is Bill Galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln. He's covered all the time with white lime dust but surely that's better than coal dust.
Grandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room. She'll take the Sacred Heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men. Besides, she has no place for a statue in her little room.
Bill Galvin comes after work to see the place. He's small, all white, and he snuffles like a dog. He asks Grandma if she'd mind taking down that statue because he's a Protestant and he wouldn't be able to sleep. Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond.
Uncle Pat says he didn't know Bill Galvin was a Protestant. You could never tell by looking at him especially the way he's covered with lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you'd never imagine a Protestant would be shoveling lime.
Bill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin Mary showing their hearts. He's not against the Sacred Heart himself, it's just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache.
Grandma says, Ah, God help us, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart won't be tormented at the sight of it.
Every morning Grandma cooks Bill's dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln. Mam wonders why he can't take it with him in the morning and Grandma says, Do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pig's toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can?
Mam tells her, In another week school will be over and if you give Frank sixpence a week he'll surely be glad to take Bill Galvin his dinner.
I don't want to go to Grandma's every day. I don't want to take Bill Galvin his dinner all the way down the Dock Road, but Mam says that's sixpence we could use and if I don't do it I'm going nowhere else.
You're staying in the house, she says. You're not playing with your
pals.
Grandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be
meandering, looking this way and that, kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes. This dinner is hot and that's the way Bill Galvin wants
it.
There's a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and
cabbage and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won't notice if I try half a potato. He won't complain to Grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two.
It's better if I eat the other half potato so that he won't be asking why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if I eat the other potato he'll surely think she didn't send one at all.
The second potato melts in my mouth and I'll have to try another bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon. There isn't much left now and he'll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest.
What am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me, Mam will keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I'll tell him I was
attacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and I'm lucky I escaped without being eaten myself.
Oh, is that so? says Bill Galvin. And what's that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey? Did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob? Go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and I'm falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln.
She'll kill me.
Tell her don't kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you don't go to her now and get me a dinner I'll kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there won't be much left for your mother to moan over.
Grandma says, What are you doin' back with that can? He could bring that back by himself.
He wants more dinner.
What do you mean more dinner? Jesus above, is it a hole he has in his leg?
He's falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln. Is it coddin' me you are?
He says send him any class of a dinner.
I will not. I sent him his dinner.
He didn't get it.
He didn't? Why not?
I ate it.
What?
I was hungry and I tasted it and I couldn't stop.
Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph.
She gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes. She
screams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest, the bishop, the Pope himself if he lived around the corner. She cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes.
Take these sandwiches to Bill Galvin and if you even look cross- eyed at them I'll skin your hide.
Of course she runs to Mam and they agree the only way I can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver Bill Galvin's dinner for a fortnight without pay. I'm to bring back the can every day and that means I have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and he's not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head.
Every day I take the can back Grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the Sacred Heart and tell Him I'm sorry and all this over Bill Galvin, a Protestant.
Mam says, I'm a martyr for the fags and so is your father.
There may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family. He has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set. When he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an
American and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us. Mam's teeth are so bad she has to go to Barrington's Hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home she's holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood. She has to sit up all night by the fire because you can't lie down when your gums are pumping blood or you'll choke in your sleep. She says she'll give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort that's in it. She tells Malachy go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and ask her would she ever let her have five Woodbines till Dad collects the dole on Thursday. If anyone can get the fags out of Kathleen, Malachy can. Mam says he has the charm, and she tells me, There's no use sending you with your long puss and your father's odd manner.
When the bleeding stops and Mam's gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth. She says she'll give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does. The new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the Woodbines eases them. She and Dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack. They try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in Dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack. Dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in Dublin and didn't fit so they were passed on to the poor of Limerick who don't care because you don't have much to chew when you're poor anyway and you're grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head. If they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out. Then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it cleans them. Mam says, No, you can't have teeth in your head while you're sleeping for they'll slip and choke you to death entirely.
The teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington's Hospital and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth?
The teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but Malachy won't give up. He forces Dad's upper teeth into his mouth and can't get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts, Uck, uck, and tears come to his eyes. The more he goes Uck, uck, the harder I laugh till Dad calls from upstairs, What are you boys doing? Malachy runs from me, up the stairs, and now I hear Dad and Mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth. They both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but Malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds. Mam says, We'll have to take him to the hospital, and Dad says he'll take him. He makes me go in case the doctor has questions because I'm older than Malachy and that means I must have started all the trouble. Dad rushes through the streets with Malachy in his arms and I try to keep up. I feel sorry for Malachy up there on Dad's shoulder, looking back at me, tears on his cheeks and Dad's teeth bulging in his mouth. The doctor at Barrington's Hospital says, No bother. He pours oil into Malachy's mouth and has the teeth out in a minute. Then he looks at me and says to Dad, Why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open?
Dad says, That's a habit he has, standing with his mouth open.
The doctor says, Come here to me. He looks up my nose, in my ears, down my throat, and feels my neck.
The tonsils, he says. The adenoids. They have to come out. The sooner the better or he'll look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot.
Next day Malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he can't get out and I have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth.
On a Saturday morning Mam finishes her tea and says, You're going to dance.
Dance? Why?
You're seven years old, you made your First Communion, and now 'tis time for the dancing. I'm taking you down to Catherine Street to Mrs. O'Connor's Irish dancing classes. You'll go there every Saturday morning and that'll keep you off the streets. That'll keep you from wandering around Limerick with hooligans.
She tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck, comb my hair, blow my nose, take the look off my face, what look? never mind, just take it off, put on my stockings and my First Communion shoes which, she says, are destroyed because I can't pass a canister or a rock without kicking it. She's worn out standing in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society begging for boots for me and Malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking. Your father says it's never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors.
What's ancestors?
Never mind, she says, you're going to dance.
I wonder how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for
Ireland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland.
Mam says, Don't get smart or I'll warm your ear.
Cyril Benson dances. He has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps. He wins contests all over Ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt. He's a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds. You don't see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots, oh, no, he's a good boy, dancing for his poor mother.
Mam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings, she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims there's enough wax there to grow potatoes, she wets my hair to make it lie down, she tells me shut up and stop the whinging, that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every Saturday, which I could have earned bringing Bill Galvin his dinner and God knows she can barely afford it. I try to tell her, Ah, Mam, sure you don't have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice Woodbine and having a cup of tea, but she says, Oh, aren't you clever. You're going to dance if I have to give up the fags forever.
If my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an Irish dancing class I'll be disgraced entirely. They think it's all right to dance and pretend you're Fred Astaire because you can jump all over the screen with Ginger Rogers. There is no Ginger Rogers in Irish dancing and you can't jump all over. You stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile.
My uncle Pa Keating said Irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses, but I can't say that to Mam, she'd kill me.
There's a gramophone in Mrs. O'Connor's playing an Irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides. Mrs. O'Connor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and I wonder how she can teach the dancing. She comes over to my mother and says, So, this is little Frankie? I think we have the makings of a dancer here. Boys and girls, do we have the makings of a dancer here?
We do, Mrs. O'Connor.
Mam says, I have the sixpence, Mrs. O'Connor.
Ah, yes, Mrs. McCourt, hold on a minute.
She waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with
kinky hair, big eyes, huge red lips and an open mouth. She tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me. All the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles. I drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut. Everyone laughs and I know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth. Mrs. O'Connor gasps and laughs and says to my mother, Isn't that a howl, now? Mam says it's a howl. She tells me behave myself and come home dancing. I don't want to stay in this place where Mrs. O'Connor can't take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boy's mouth.
I don't want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls, straighten your back, hands by your sides, look ahead, don't look down, move your feet, move your feet, look at Cyril, look at Cyril, and there goes Cyril, all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling, medals for this and medals for that and the girls love Cyril and Mrs. O'Connor loves Cyril for didn't he bring her fame and didn't she teach him every step he knows, oh, dance, Cyril, dance, oh, Jesus, he floats around the room, he's an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning, Frankie McCourt, or you'll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe, dance, Frankie, dance, pick up your feet for the love o' Jesus, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree, Maura, will you help that Frankie McCourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely, help him, Maura.
Maura is a big girl about ten. She dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancer's dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says, Give me your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I'm dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to cry but I'm saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh.
Mrs. O'Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous. Next week, boys and girls, and don't forget the sixpence for the little black boy.
Boys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals won't see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times.
Mam is having tea with Bridey Hannon, her friend from next door. Mam says, What did you learn? and makes me dance around the kitchen, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree. She has a good
laugh with Bridey. That's not too bad for your first time. In a month you'll be like a regular Cyril Benson.
I don't want to be Cyril Benson. I want to be Fred Astaire.
They turn hysterical, laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths, Jesus love him, says Bridey. Doesn't he have a great notion of himself. Fred Astaire how are you.
Mam says Fred Astaire went to his lessons every Saturday and didn't go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if I wanted to be like him I'd have to go to Mrs. O'Connor's every week.
The fourth Saturday morning Billy Campbell knocks at our door. Mrs. McCourt, can Frankie come out and play? Mam tells him, No, Billy. Frankie is going to his dancing lesson.
He waits for me at the bottom of Barrack Hill. He wants to know why I'm dancing, that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and I'll wind up like Cyril Benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls. He says next thing I'll be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks. He says dancing will destroy me and I won't be fit to play any kind of football, soccer, rugby or Gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh.
I tell him I'm finished with the dancing, that I have sixpence in my pocket for Mrs. O'Connor that's supposed to go into the black boy's mouth, that I'm going to the Lyric Cinema instead. Sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of Cleeves' toffee, and we have a great time looking at Riders of the Purple Sage.
Dad is sitting by the fire with Mam and they want to know what steps I learned today and what they're called. I already did ""The Siege of Ennis"" and ""The Walls of Limerick, "" which are real dances. Now I have to make up names and dances. Mam says she never heard of a dance called ""The Siege of Dingle""but if that's what I learned go ahead, dance it, and I dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music, diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you, Dad and Mam clapping in time with my feet. Dad says, Och, that's a fine dance and you'll be a powerful Irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country. Mam says, That wasn't much for a sixpence.
Next week it's a George Raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with George O'Brien. Then it's James Cagney and I can't take Billy because I want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my Cleeves' toffee and I'm having a great time till there's a terrible pain in my jaw and it's a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me. Still, I can't waste the toffee so I pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all. There's pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and I remember what my uncle Pa Keating would say, There are times when you wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind.
I have to go home now and worry because you can't go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing. Mothers know everything and she's always looking into our mouths to see if there's any class of disease. She's there by the fire and Dad is there and they're asking me the same old questions, the dance and the name of the dance. I tell them I learned ""The Walls of Cork"" and I dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth. Mam says, ""Walls o' Cork, "" my eye, there's no such dance, and Dad says, Come over here. Stand there before me. Tell us the truth, Did you go to your dancing classes today?
I can't tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and there's blood in my mouth. Besides, I know they know everything and that's what they're telling me now. Some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the Lyric Cinema and told and Mrs. O'Connor sent a note to say she hadn't seen me in ages and was I all right because I had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great Cyril Benson.
Dad doesn't care about my tooth or anything. He says I'm going to confession and drags me over to the Redemptorist church because it's Saturday and confessions go on all day. He tells me I'm a bad boy, he's ashamed of me that I went to the pictures instead of learning Ireland's national dances, the jig, the reel, the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries. He says there's many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the Irish dance.
The priest is old and I have to yell my sins at him and he tells me I'm a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films, that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves, but even if dancing is an abomination I sinned by taking my mother's sixpence and lying and there's a hot place in hell for the likes of me, say a decade of the rosary and ask God's forgiveness for you're dancing at the gates of hell itself, child.
I'm seven, eight, nine going on ten and still Dad has no work. He drinks his tea in the morning, signs for the dole at the Labour Exchange, reads the papers at the Carnegie Library, goes for his long walks far into the country. If he gets a job at the Limerick Cement Company or Rank's Flour Mills he loses it in the third week. He loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third Friday of the job, drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on Saturday morning.
Mam says, Why can't he be like the other men from the lanes of Limerick? They're home before the Angelus rings at six o'clock, they hand over their wages, change their shirts, have their tea, get a few shillings from the wife and they're off to the pub for a pint or two.
Mam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can't be like that and won't be like that. She says he's a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He'll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he'll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they're invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all.
Oh, no, says Mam, they won't disagree and they won't step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he's a grand man, even if he's from the North, and 'twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot.
Mam tells Bridey, I don't know under God what I'm going to do. The dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week, the rent is six and six, and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter.
Bridey drags on her Woodbine, drinks her tea and declares that God is good. Mam says she's sure God is good for someone somewhere but He hasn't been seen lately in the lanes of Limerick.
Bridey laughs. Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, Aren't I there already, Bridey?
And they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their Woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have.
'Tis.
Question Quigley tells me I have to go to the Redemptorist church on Friday and join the boys' division of the Arch Confraternity. You have to join. You can't say no. All the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join.
Question says, Your father is a foreigner from the North and he don't matter but you still have to join.
Everyone knows Limerick is the holiest city in Ireland because it has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family, the biggest sodality in the world. Any city can have a Confraternity, only Limerick has the Arch.
Our Confraternity fills the Redemptorist church five nights a week, three for the men, one for the women, one for the boys. There is Benediction and hymn singing in English, Irish and Latin and best of all the big powerful sermon Redemptorist priests are famous for. It's the sermon that saves millions of Chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the Protestants.
The Question says you have to join the Confraternity so that your mother can tell the St. Vincent de Paul Society and they'll know you're a good Catholic. He says his father is a loyal member and that's how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself he'll get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police so that he can sing ""I'll Be Calling You Ooo Ooo Ooo, "" like Nelson Eddy singing to Jeanette MacDonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa. If he brings me to the Confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section, which is all he wants in life next to wearing the Mountie uniform.
The prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets. Every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefect's seat. The prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during Benediction or commit any other sacrileges. If you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why, wants to know if you're slipping away from the Confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office, I think our little friend here has taken the soup. That's the worst thing you can say to any Catholic in Limerick or Ireland itself because of what happened in the Great Famine. If you're absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if you're absent three times he sends The Posse, which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure you're not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the Confraternity praying for the Chinese and other lost souls. The Posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger. Some mothers worry but others will say, Get away from my door or I'll come out and give every one o' ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse. These are not good Confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that they'll see the error of their ways.
The worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the Confraternity himself, Father Gorey. He'll stand at the top of the lane
and roar in the voice that converted the Chinese millions, Where is the house of Frank McCourt? He roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live. He roars because he wants the world to know you're slipping away from the Confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger. The mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper, I'm not here, I'm not here, and they'll make sure you go to the Confraternity from this on out so they won't be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands.
The Question takes me to the section St. Finbar's, and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he's fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he's making this the best section in the Confraternity and if I'm ever absent he'll break my arse and send the bits to my mother. There's no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you're ever absent it better be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you hear me?
I do, Declan.
Boys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at Cannock's big shop on Patrick Street. His uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of a job at Cannock's if he's a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and that's why Declan will destroy us if we're absent. He tells us, No one will stand between me and the linoleum.
Declan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get married I'm going to cover my house in linoleum and I'll buy it all from you.
Other boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, Bugger off, ye'll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum.
Dad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and it's time for me to be an altar boy. Mam says, What's the use? The child doesn't have proper clothes for school never mind the altar. Dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we don't have the money for robes and the wash they need every week.
He says God will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor. He takes the part of the priest for he has the whole Mass in his head and I have to know the responses. He says, Introibo ad altare Dei, and I have to say, Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam.
Every evening after tea I kneel for the Latin and he won't let me move till I'm perfect. Mam says he could at least let me sit but he says Latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees. You won't find the Pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the Latin.
The Latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and I'd like to be out in the lane playing though still I'd like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy, up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal Jimmy Clark, answering the priest in Latin, moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to
the other, pouring water and wine into the chalice, pouring water over the priest's hands, ringing the bell at Consecration, kneeling, bowing, swinging the censer at Benediction, sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon, everyone in St. Joseph's looking at me and admiring my ways.
In a fortnight I have the Mass in my head and it's time to go to St. Joseph's to see the sacristan, Stephen Carey, who is in charge of altar boys. Dad polishes my boots. Mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt. She boils water to scrub my head, neck, hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows. She scrubs till my skin burns and tells Dad she wouldn't give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty. She wishes I didn't have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending I was the greatest footballer in the world. She wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress. She warns me speak up when I go to St. Joseph's and don't be mumbling in English or Latin. She says, 'Tis a great pity you grew out of your First Communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of, you come from good blood, McCourts, Sheehans, or my mother's family the Guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in County Limerick before the English took it away and gave it to footpads from London.
Dad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way we're saying Latin back and forth. He knocks at the sacristy door and tells Stephen Carey, This is my son, Frank, who knows the Latin and is ready to be an altar boy.
Stephen Carey looks at him, then me. He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door.
Dad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and I want to cry out. He says nothing on the way home. He takes off his cap, sits by the fire and lights a Woodbine. Mam is smoking, too. Well, she says, is he going to be an altar boy?
There's no room for him.
Oh. She puffs on her Woodbine. I'll tell you what it is, she says. 'Tis class distinction. They don't want boys from lanes on the altar. They don't want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up. Oh, no, they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs. That's what it is and 'tis hard to hold on to the Faith with the snobbery that's in it.
Och, aye.
Oh, och aye my arse. That's all you ever say. You could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with Latin and why can't he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that Latin?
Och, he might grow up to be a priest.
I ask him if I can go out and play. Yes, he says, go out and play. Mam says, You might as well.
VI
Mr. O'Neill is the master in the fourth class at school. We call him Dotty because he's small like a dot. He teaches in the one classroom with
a platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see. The first day of school in September he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year, Euclid, geometry, idiot. He says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand. He says anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Now, repeat after me, Anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Of course we all know what an idiot is because that's what the masters keep telling us we are.
Brendan Quigley raises his hand. Sir, what's a theorem and what's a Euclid?
We expect Dotty to lash at Brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at Brendan with a little smile. Ah, now, here's a boy with not one but two questions. What is your name, boy?
Brendan Quigley, sir.
This is a boy who will go far. Where will he go, boys?
Far, sir.
Indeed and he will. The boy who wants to know something about the
grace, elegance and beauty of Euclid can go nowhere but up. In what direction and no other can this boy go, boys?
Up, sir.
Without Euclid, boys, mathematics would be a poor doddering thing. Without Euclid we wouldn't be able to go from here to there. Without Euclid the bicycle would have no wheel. Without Euclid St. Joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry. Without Euclid this very school could never have been built.
Paddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin' Euclid.
Dotty barks at him. You, boy, what is your name?
Clohessy, sir.
Ah, the boy flies on one wing. What is your Christian name? Paddy.
Paddy what?
Paddy, sir.
And what, Paddy, were you saying to McCourt? I said we
down on our two knees and thank God for Euclid.
I'm sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in
What do I see, boys?
The lie, sir.
And what is the lie doing, boys?
Festering, sir.
Where, boys, where?
In his teeth, sir.
Euclid, boys, was a Greek. What, Clohessy, is a Greek? Some class of a foreigner, sir.
Clohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you
should get
your teeth.
know what a
Greek is?
Yes, sir. Euclid was a Greek.
Dotty gives him the little smile. He tells Clohessy he should model
himself on Quigley, who knows what a Greek is. He draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet, not if they were to be extended to infinity, not if they were extended to God's shoulders and that, boys, is a long way though there is a German Jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines.
We listen to Dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the Germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands. We can't ask him ourselves but we can get Brendan Quigley to do it. Anyone can see Brendan is the master's pet and that means he can ask any question he likes. After school we tell Brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow, What use is Euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the Germans are bombing everything? Brendan says he doesn't want to be the master's pet, he didn't ask for it, and he doesn't want to ask the question. He's afraid if he asks that question Dotty will attack him. We tell him if he doesn't ask the question we'll attack him.
Next day Brendan raises his hand. Dotty gives him the little smile. Sir, what use is Euclid and all the lines when the Germans are bombing everything that stands?
The little smile is gone. Ah, Brendan. Ah, Quigley. Oh, boys, oh, boys.
He lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed. What use is Euclid? he says. Use? Without Euclid the Messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky. Without Euclid the Spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud. Euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance. What does he bring us, boys?
Grace, sir.
And?
Beauty, sir.
And?
Elegance, sir.
Euclid is complete in himself and divine in application. Do you
understand that, boys?
We do, sir.
I doubt it, boys, I doubt it. To love Euclid is to be alone in this world.
He opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery.
Paddy Clohessy is leaving the school that day and he's stopped by Mr. O'Dea, who teaches the fifth class. Mr. O'Dea says, You, what's your
name?
Clohessy, sir.
What class are you in?
Fourth class, sir.
Now tell me, Clohessy, is that master of yours talking to you about
Euclid?
He is, sir.
And what is he saying?
He's saying he's a Greek.
Of course he is, you diddering omadhaun. What else is he saying? He's saying there would be no school without Euclid.
Ah. Now is he drawing anything on the board?
He's drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they
land on God's shoulders.
Mother o' God.
No, sir. God's shoulders.
I know, you idiot. Go home.
The next day there's a great noise at our classroom door and Mr. O'Dea is yelling, Come out, O'Neill, you chancer, you poltroon. We can hear everything he's saying because of the broken glass over the door.
The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, is saying, Now, now, Mr. O'Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils.
Well, then, Mr. O'Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth. The geometry is mine. Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don't want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform, him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. Tell him Euclid is mine, Mr. O'Halloran, or I'll put a stop to his gallop.
Mr. O'Halloran tells Mr. O'Dea to return to his classroom and asks Mr. O'Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O'Halloran says, Now, Mr. O'Neill, I have asked you before to stay away from Euclid.
You have, Mr. O'Halloran, but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple.
I'll have to insist, Mr. O'Neill. No more Euclid.
Mr. O'Neill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again. He says little has changed since the time of the Greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion. What has changed since the time of the Greeks, boys?
It is torture to watch Mr. O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.
There are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket. Then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or he'll leave it for the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, to take it all away in her big canvas sack. We'd like to ask Nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but she's weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us, I have other things to be doin' with me life besides watchin' a scabby bunch rootin' around for the skin of an apple. Go 'way.
He peels the apple slowly. He looks around the room with the little smile. He teases us, Do you think, boys, I should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill? We say, No, sir, pigeons don't eat apples. Paddy Clohessy calls out, 'Twill give them the runs, sir, and we'll have it on our heads abroad in the yard.
Clohessy, you are an omadhaun. Do you know what an omadhaun is?
I don't, sir.
It's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun
is a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir.
Clohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun.
He pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins. Hands up, he says, who is the President of the United States of America?
Every hand in the class goes up and we're all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know. We call out, Roosevelt.
Then he says, You, Mulcahy, who stood at the foot of the cross when Our Lord was crucified?
Mulcahy is slow. The Twelve Apostles, sir. Mulcahy, what is the Irish word for fool? Omadhaun, sir.
And what are you, Mulcahy?
An omadhaun, sir.
Fintan Slattery raises his hand. I know who stood at the foot of the cross, sir.
Of course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross. Why wouldn't he? He's always running off to Mass with his mother, who is known for her holiness. She's so holy her husband ran off to Canada to cut down trees, glad to be gone and never to be heard from again. She and Fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines: The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart, The Lantern, The Far East, as well as every little book printed by the Catholic Truth Society. They go to Mass and Communion rain or shine and every Saturday they confess to the Jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on Fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it. Fintan and his mother live on Catherine Street and Mrs. Slattery's neighbors call her Mrs. Offer-It-Up because no matter what happens, a broken leg, a spilled cup of tea, a disappeared husband, she says, Well, now, I'll offer that up and I'll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names he'll smile and tell you he'll pray for you and he'll offer it up for his soul and yours. The boys in Leamy's don't want Fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which is ridiculous because you can't be a saint till you're dead. He says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every Saturday night so that he'll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he meets you going to Mass he'll say, Isn't my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He loves that word, gorgeous, and no other boy will ever use it.
Of course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross. He probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now he's telling Dotty O'Neill it was the three Marys. Dotty says, Come up here, Fintan, and take your reward. He takes his time going to the platform and we can't believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win. He raises his hand, Sir, I'd like to give some of my apple away.
The apple, Fintan? No, indeed. You do not have the apple, Fintan. You have the peel, the mere skin. You have not nor will you ever achieve
heights so dizzy you'll be feasting on the apple itself. Not my apple, Fintan. Now did I hear you say you want to give away your reward?
You did, sir. I'd like to give three pieces, to Quigley, Clohessy and McCourt.
Why, Fintan?
They're my friends, sir.
The boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and I
feel ashamed because they'll say I curl my hair and I'll be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think I'm his friend? If they say I wear my sister's blouse there's no use telling them I don't have a sister because they'll say, You'd wear it if you had a sister. There's no use saying anything in the schoolyard because there's always someone with an answer and there's nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you'd be punching morning noon and night.
Quigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan. Thanks, Fintan.
The whole class is looking at Clohessy because he's the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks I'll say thanks. He says, Thanks very much, Fintan, and blushes and I say, Thanks very much, Fintan, and I try to stop myself from blushing but I can't and all the boys sneer again and I'd like to hit them.
After school the boys call to Fintan, Hoi, Fintan, are you goin'home to curl your gorgeous hair? Fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard. A big boy from seventh class says to Paddy Clohessy, I suppose you'd be curlin' your hair too if you wasn't a baldy with a shaved head.
Paddy says, Shurrup, and the boy says, Oh, an' who's goin' to make me? Paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and there's blood. I try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till I see lights and black dots. Paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him. Fintan is outside on the street and he says, Oh, Francis, Francis, oh, Patrick, Patrick, what's up? Why are you crying, Patrick? and Paddy says, I'm hungry. I can't fight nobody because I'm starving with the hunger an' fallin' down an' I'm ashamed of meself.
Fintan says, Come with me, Patrick. My mother will give us something, and Paddy says, Ah, no, me nose is bleedin'.
Don't worry. She'll put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck. Francis, you must come, too. You always look hungry.
Ah, no, Fintan.
Ah, do, Francis.
All right, Fintan.
Fintan's flat is like a chapel. There are two pictures, the Sacred
Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Jesus is showing His heart with the crown of thorns, the fire, the blood. His head is tilted to the left to show His great sorrow. The Virgin Mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didn't have that crown of thorns. Her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her Son will come to a sad end.
There's a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him. Fintan says, Do you know who that is, Francis? No? That's your patron, St. Francis of Assisi, and do you know what today is?
The fourth of October.
That's right and it's his feast day and special for you because you can ask St. Francis for anything and he'll surely give it to you. That's why I wanted you to come here today. Sit down, Patrick, sit down, Francis.
Mrs. Slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand. She's happy to meet Fintan's new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich? And look at your poor nose, Patrick. She touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer. She tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the Pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind Patrick's poor nose.
Fintan says he won't have a sandwich because he's fasting and praying for the boy who hit Paddy and me. Mrs. Slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him he's a saint out of heaven and asks if we'd like mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on cheese and I'd love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see his teeth are white and black and green.
We eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home. Me mother'll kill me. I'll wait for you outside, Frankie.
Now I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can't pee because he's looking at me and he says, You were fooling. You don't have to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis. That's all. I wouldn't want to commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation coming next year.
Paddy and I leave together. I'm bursting and run behind a garage to pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he says, That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an' him an' his mother is very holy but I wouldn't want to go to Fintan's flat anymore because he's very odd, isn't he, Frankie?
He is, Paddy.
The way he looks at it when you take it out, that's odd, isn't it, Frankie?
'Tis, Paddy.
A few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won't be there and she leaves his lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk. Will we go?
Fintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say, Will you come? I whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides.
Boys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks. Oh, Gawd, look at Fintan and his ingles. Paddy says, Fintan, what's an ingle? and Fintan says it's just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner, that's all. He tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like, Film Fun, the Beano, the Dandy, or the religious magazines or his mother's romance magazines, the Miracle and the Oracle, which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the Thames with the
hopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke, which is much higher than an earl, so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because she's happy tending her roses on her twelve-thousand-acre estate in Shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother, who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world.
Paddy says, I don't want to read nothing, it's all a cod, all them stories. Fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk. The milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white. Paddy says, Is that a ham sangwidge? and Fintan says, 'Tis. Paddy says, That's a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it? Fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two. Mustard seeps out. He licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk. He cuts the sandwich again into quarters, eighths, sixteenths, takes The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and Paddy and I look at him and I know Paddy is wondering what we're doing here at all, at all, because that's what I'm wondering myself hoping Fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesn't, he finishes the milk, leaves bits of sandwich on the plate, covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way, lowers his head, blesses himself and says grace after meals and, God, we'll be late for school, and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the Virgin Mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldn't make it out for ourselves.
It's too late for Paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from Nellie Ahearn and I don't know how I'm going to last from now till I can run home after school and get a piece of bread. Paddy stops at the school gate. He says, I can't go in there starving with the hunger. I'd fall asleep and Dotty'd kill me.
Fintan is anxious. Come on, come on, we'll be late. Come on, Francis, hurry up.
I'm not going in, Fintan. You had your lunch. We had nothing.
Paddy explodes. You're a feckin' chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss my arse, Fintan.
Oh, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick my feckin' arse, Fintan. Come on, Frankie.
Fintan runs into school and Paddy and I make our way to an orchard
in Ballinacurra. We climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till Paddy talks to him and tells him he's a good dog and we're hungry and go home to your mother. The dog licks Paddy's face and trots away waving his tail and Paddy is delighted with himself. We stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse.
There are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, 'tis milkin' time, and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. 'Tis lovely. Get that other cow, they're all ready for the milkin'.
I get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and I'm sure she's going to kill me. Paddy comes over and shows me how to do it, pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream. The two of us lie under the one cow and we're having a great time filling ourselves with milk when there's a roar and there's a man with a stick charging across the field. We're over the wall in a minute and he can't follow us because of his rubber boots. He stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us we'll have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because we're out of harm's way and I'm wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples.
It's all right for Paddy to say Dotty can shove the apple up his arse but I don't want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and I'll always try to win Dotty's apple peel so that I can go home and tell Dad how I answered the hard questions.
We're walking back through Ballinacurra. There's rain and lightning and we run but it's hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me. Paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement. My shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound, squish, squish. Paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds, slap slap, squish, squish, slap squish, squish slap. We laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another. The rain gets heavier and we know we can't stand under a tree or we'll be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door we're a disgrace. We run from the door and Paddy calls back, Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels, and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness. There's no sense in standing in from the rain anymore, we're soaked to the skin, so we take our time down O'Connell Avenue. Paddy says he learned that Mullingar heifer thing from his uncle Peter, the one that was in India in the English army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are Indians and loyal to the King. Uncle Peter had a great time for himself in a place called Kashmir, which is lovelier than Killarney that they're always bragging about and singing. Paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in India in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and he's making me hungry even if I'm stuffed with apples and milk.
The rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads. Paddy says they're ducks or geese or something on their way to Africa where it's nice and warm. The birds have more sense than the Irish. They come to the Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, maybe even India. He says he'll write me a letter when he's over there and I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot.
What's that dot for, Paddy?
It shows they're high class, the quality.
But, Paddy, would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes?
Course they would, but the English quality wouldn't. The English quality wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.
Steam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself?
Naw, naw, that's what my father says below in the bed when he's coughin' up the gobs and blamin' the English for everything.
And I think, Steam of their piss. I'll keep that for myself. I'll go around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and when I go to America some day I'll be the only one who knows it.
Question Quigley is wobbling toward us on a big woman's bicycle and calls to me, Hoi, Frankie McCourt, you're going to be killed. Dotty O'Neill sent a note to your house and said you didn't come back to school after lunch, that you went on the mooch with Paddy Clohessy. Your mother is going to kill you. Your father is out looking for you and he's going to kill you, too.
Oh, God, I feel cold and empty and I wish I could be in India where it's nice and warm and there's no school and my father could never find me to kill me. Paddy tells the Question, He didn't go on the mooch and I didn't either. Fintan Slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk. Then Paddy says to me, Don't mind 'em, Frankie, 'tis all a cod. They're always sendin' notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them.
My mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and I'm afraid now to go home. The Question rides off on the bicycle, laughing, and I don't know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and that's worse than mooching from school half a day anytime.
I could turn up the Barrack Road now and go home and tell my parents I'm sorry I went on the mooch and I did it because of the hunger but Paddy says, Come on, we'll go down the Dock Road and throw rocks in the Shannon.
We throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank. It's getting dark and I don't know where I'm going to sleep. I might have to stay there by the Shannon or find a door or I might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like Brendan Quigley with four goats. Paddy says I can go home with him, I can sleep on the floor and I'll dry out.
Paddy lives in one of the tall houses on Arthur's Quay looking at the river. Everyone in Limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute. Mam often says, I don't want any of ye going down to Arthur's Quay and if I find ye there I'll break yeer faces. The people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed.
It's raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs. Paddy says, Mind yourself, because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there. He says that's because there's only one privy and it's in the backyard and children don't get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl, God help us.
There's a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette. She says, Is that you, Paddy?
'Tis, Mammy.
I'm fagged out, Paddy. Them steps is killin' me. Did you have your tea?
I didn't.
Well, I don't know if there's any bread left. Go up an' see. Paddy's family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small
fireplace. There are two tall windows and you can see out to the Shannon. His father is in a bed in the corner, groaning and spitting into a bucket. Paddy's brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor, sleeping, talking, looking at the ceiling. There's a baby with no clothes crawling over to Paddy's father's bucket and Paddy pulls him away. His mother comes in, gasping, from the stairs. Jesus, I'm dead, she says.
She finds some bread and makes weak tea for Paddy and me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They don't say anything. They don't say what are you doing here or go home or anything till Mr. Clohessy says, Who's that? and Paddy tells him, 'Tis Frankie McCourt.
Mr. Clohessy says, McCourt? What class of a name is that? My father is from the North, Mr. Clohessy.
And what's your mother's name?
Angela, Mr. Clohessy.
Ah, Jaysus, 'twouldn't be Angela Sheehan, would it?
'Twould, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, he says, and he has a coughing fit which brings up all kinds of stuff from his insides and has him hanging over the bucket. When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o' Christ, I'm dying inside, danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion dancer she was too.
He hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his arms out to get it. He suffers but he won't stop talking.
Champion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. Can you dance, Frankie?
Ah, no, Mr. Clohessy.
Paddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O'Connor and Cyril Benson.
Well, dance, Frankie. Round the house an' mind the dresser, Frankie. Lift the foot, lad.
I can't, Mr. Clohessy. I'm no good.
No good? Angela's Sheehan's son? Dance, Frankie, or I'll get outa this bed an' wheel you round the house.
My shoe is broken, Mr. Clohessy.
Frankie, Frankie, you're bringin' the cough on me. Will you dance for the love o' Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in the Wembley Hall. Take off the feckin' shoe, Frankie, an' dance.
I have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh, The Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us.
Mr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes o' that on land or sea. That's a great leg for the dancing you have there, Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they want to.
Paddy lies down on a mattress by the window and I lie beside him. I keep my clothes on like everybody else and I even forget to take off my
other shoe, which is wet and squishy and stinks. Paddy falls asleep right away and I look at his mother sitting by the bit of a fire smoking another cigarette. Paddy's father groans and coughs and spits into the bucket. He says, Feckin' blood, and she says, You'll have to go into the sanatorium sooner or later.
I will not. The day they put you in there is the end of you.
You could be givin'the consumption to the children. I could get the guards to take you away you're that much of a danger to the children.
If they were to get it they'd have it be now.
The fire dies and Mrs. Clohessy climbs over him into the bed. In a minute she's snoring even if he's still coughing and laughing about the days of his youth when he danced with Angela Sheehan light as a feather in the Wembley Hall.
It's cold in the room and I'm shivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is shivering too but he's asleep and he doesn't know he's cold. I don't know if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering the streets when a guard might ask you what you're doing out. It's my first time away from my family and I know I'd rather be in my own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It's bad when our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it's worse in the Clohessys' when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory and slip on shit all the way down. I'd be better off with four goats in a ditch.
I drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up. They all went to bed with their clothes on so they don't have to get dressed and there's no fighting. They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too and I run down with Paddy but his sister Peggy is on the bowl and we have to piss against a wall. She says, I'll tell Ma what ye did, and Paddy says, Shurrup or I'll push you down into that feckin' lavatory. She jumps off the lavatory, pulls her drawers up and runs up the stairs crying, I'll tell, I'll tell, and when we get back to the room Mrs. Clohessy gives Paddy a belt on the head for what he did to his poor little sister. Paddy says nothing because Mrs. Clohessy is spooning porridge into mugs and jam jars and one bowl and telling us to eat up and go to school. She sits at the table eating her porridge. Her hair is gray black and dirty. It dangles in the bowl and picks up bits of porridge and drops of milk. The children slurp the porridge and complain they didn't get enough, they're starving with the hunger. They have snotty noses and sore eyes and scabby knees. Mr. Clohessy coughs and squirms on the bed and brings up the great gobs of blood and I run out of the room and puke on the stairs where there's a step missing and there's a shower of porridge and bits of apple to the floor below where people go back and forth to the lavatory in the yard. Paddy comes down and says, Sure that's all right. Everywan gets sick an' shits on them stairs an' the whole feckin' place is falling down anyway.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. If I go back to school I'll be killed and why should I go back to school or go home to get killed when I can go out the road and live on milk and apples the rest of my life till I go to America. Paddy says, Come on. School is all a cod anyway an' the masters is all madmen.
There's a knock at the Clohessys' door and it's Mam holding my little brother, Michael, by the hand, and Guard Dennehy, who is in charge of school attendance. Mam sees me and says, What are you doing with one shoe on? and Guard Dennehy says, Ah, now, missus, I think a more
important question would be, What are you doing with one shoe off, ha,
ha.
Michael runs to me. Mammy was crying. Mammy was crying for you,
Frankie.
She says, Where were you all night?
I was here.
You had me demented. Your father walked every street in Limerick
looking for you.
Mr. Clohessy says, Who's at the door?
It's my mother, Mr. Clohessy.
God above, is that Angela?
'Tis, Mr. Clohessy.
He struggles up on his elbows. Well, for the love of God, will you
come in, Angela. Don't you know me?
Mam looks puzzled. It's dark in the room and she tries to make out
who is in the bed. He says, 'Tis me, Dennis Clohessy, Angela. Ah, no.
'Tis, Angela.
Ah, no.
I know, Angela. I'm changed. The cough is killin' me. But I
remember the nights at the Wembley Hall. Aw, Jaysus, you were a great dancer. Nights at the Wembley Hall, Angela, and the fish and chips after. Oh, boys, oh, boys, Angela.
My mother has tears running down her face. She says, You were a great dancer yourself, Dennis Clohessy.
We could have won competitions, Angela. Fred and Ginger would have been lookin' over their shoulders but you had to run off to America. Aw, Jaysus.
He has another coughing fit and we have to stand and watch him hang over the bucket again and bring up the bad stuff from his insides. Guard Dennehy says, I think, missus, we found the by an' I'll be going. He says to me, If you ever go on the mooch again, by, we'll have you in the jail above. Are you listenin' to me, by?
I am, Guard.
Don't be tormentin' your mother, by. That's wan thing the guards won't put up with, the tormentin' of mothers.
I won't, Guard. I won't torment her.
He leaves and Mam goes to the bed to take Mr. Clohessy's hand. His face is caved in all around his eyes and his hair is shiny black with the sweat running from the top of his head. His children stand around the bed looking at him and looking at Mam. Mrs. Clohessy sits by the fire rattling the poker in the grate and pushing the baby away from the fire. She says, 'Tis his own bloody fault for not goin' into hospital, so 'tis.
Mr. Clohessy gasps, I'd be all right if I could live in a dry place. Angela, is America a dry place?
'Tis, Dennis.
The doctor told me go to Arizona. A funny man that doctor. Arizona how are you. I don't have the money to go around the corner for a pint.
Mam says, You'll be all right, Dennis. I'll light a candle for you. Save your money, Angela. My dancin' days are done.
I have to go now, Dennis. My son has to go to school.
Before you go, Angela, will you do one thing for me?
I will, Dennis, if 'tis in my power.
Would you ever give us a verse of that song you sang the night before you went to America?
That's a hard song, Dennis. I wouldn't have the wind for it.
Ah, come on, Angela. I never hear a song anymore. There isn't a song in this house. The wife there doesn't have a note in her head an' no step in her foot.
Mam says, All right. I'll try.
Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune, Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.
When the boys began to gather in the glen of a Summer night, And the Kerry piper's tuning made us long with wild delight.
She stops and presses her hand to her chest, Oh, God, my wind is gone. Help me, Frank, with the song, and I sing along, Oh, to think of it, Oh, to dream of it, fills my heart with tears.
Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.
Mr. Clohessy tries to sing with us, gone, alas, like our youth too soon, but it brings on the cough. He shakes his head and cries, I wouldn't doubt you, Angela. It takes me back. God bless you.
God bless you, too, Dennis, and thanks, Mrs. Clohessy, for having Frankie here off the streets.
'Twas no trouble, Mrs. McCourt. He's quiet enough.
Quiet enough, says Mr. Clohessy, but he's not the dancer his mother
was.
Mam says, 'Tis hard to dance with one shoe, Dennis.
I know, Angela, but you'd wonder why he didn't take it off. Is he a
bit strange?
Ah, sometimes he has the odd manner like his father. Oh, yes. The
father is from the North, Angela, and that would account for it. They'd think nothing of dancing with one shoe in the North.
We walk up Patrick Street and O'Connell Street, Paddy Clohessy and Mam and Michael and myself, and Mam sobs all the way. Michael says, Don't cry, Mammy. Frankie won't run away.
She lifts him up and hugs him. Oh, no, Michael, 'tisn't Frankie I'm crying about. 'Tis Dennis Clohessy and the dancing nights at the Wembley Hall and the fish and chips after.
She comes into the school with us. Mr. O'Neill looks cross and tells us sit down he'll be with us in a minute. He talks a long time at the door with my mother and when she leaves he walks between the seats and pats Paddy Clohessy on the head.
I'm very sorry for the Clohessys and all their troubles but I think they saved me from getting into trouble with my mother.
VII
There are Thursdays when Dad gets his dole money at the Labour Exchange and a man might say, Will we go for a pint, Malachy? and Dad will say, One, only one, and the man will say, Oh, God, yes, one, and before the night is over all the money is gone and Dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for Ireland when the
call comes. He even gets Michael up and he's only three but there he is singing and promising to die for Ireland at the first opportunity. That's what Dad calls it, the first opportunity. I'm nine and Malachy is eight and we know all the songs. We sing all the verses of Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley, ""The West's Asleep, ""
""O'Donnell Abu, ""
""The Boys of Wexford. "" We sing and promise to die because you never know when Dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to Kathleen O'Connell's next day for toffee. Some nights he says Michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny. Malachy and I wonder what's the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when Michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore. No one can ask him to die for Ireland at the age of three, not even Padraig Pearse, who was shot by the English in Dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him. Besides, Mikey Molloy's father said anyone who wants to die for Ireland is a donkey's arse. Men have been dying for Ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country.
It's bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she won't talk to him. He has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country. When he returns in the evening she still won't talk to him and she won't make his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there's no way of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting sound. When she's not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know we're not supposed to talk to him either for fear she'll give us the bitter look. We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him. Even little Michael knows that when Dad does the bad thing you don't talk to him from Friday to Monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to Mam.
I'm nine years old and I have a pal, Mickey Spellacy, whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption. I envy Mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow.
But this summer Mickey is worried. His sister, Brenda, is wasting away with the consumption and it's only August and if she dies before September he won't get his week off from school because you can't get a week off from school when there's no school. He comes to Billy Campbell and me to ask if we'll go around the corner to St. Joseph's Church and pray for Brenda to hang on till September.
What's in it for us, Mickey, if we go around the corner praying?
Well, if Brenda hangs on and I get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night.
Who could say no to that? There's nothing like a wake for having a good time. We trot around to the church where they have statues of St. Joseph himself as well as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and
St. Thérèse of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I pray to the Little Flower because she died of the consumption herself and she'd understand.
One of our prayers must have been powerful because Brenda stays alive and doesn't die till the second day of school. We tell Mickey we're sorry for his troubles but he's delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets.
My mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda's wake. Billy knocks on the door and there's Mickey's aunt. Well?
We came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come to the wake.
She yells, Mickey! What? Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister's wake?
No.
But, Mickey, you promised...
She slams the door in our faces. We don't know what to do till
Billy Campbell says, We'll go back to St. Joseph's and pray that from now on everyone in Mickey Spellacy's family will die in the middle of the summer and he'll never get a day off from school for the rest of his life.
One of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn't get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson.
Proddy Woddy ring the bell,
Not for heaven but for hell.
On Sunday mornings in Limerick I watch them go to church, the Protestants, and I feel sorry for them, especially the girls, who are so lovely, they have such beautiful white teeth. I feel sorry for the beautiful Protestant girls, they're doomed. That's what the priests tell us. Outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. Outside the Catholic Church there is nothing but doom. And I want to save them. Protestant girl, come with me to the True Church. You'll be saved and you won't have the doom. After Mass on Sunday I go with my friend Billy Campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on Barrington Street. Croquet is a Protestant game. They hit the ball with the mallet, pock and pock again, and laugh. I wonder how they can laugh or don't they even know they're doomed? I feel sorry for them and I say, Billy, what's the use of playing croquet when you're doomed?
He says, Frankie, what's the use of not playing croquet when you're doomed?
Grandma says to Mam, Your brother Pat, bad leg an' all, was selling papers all over Limerick by the time he was eight and that Frank of yours is big and ugly enough to work.
But he's only nine and still in school.
School. 'Tis school that has him the way he is talkin' back an' goin' around with the sour puss an' the odd manner like his father. He could get out an' help poor Pat of a Friday night when the Limerick Leader is a ton weight. He could run up the long garden paths of the quality an' save Pat's poor legs an' earn a few pennies into the bargain.
He has to go to the Confraternity on Friday nights.
Never mind the Confraternity. There's nothin' in the catechism about confraternities.
I meet Uncle Pat at the Limerick Leader on Friday evening at five. The man handing out the papers says my arms are that skinny I'd be lucky to carry two stamps but Uncle Pat sticks eight papers under each arm. He tells me, I'll kill you if you drop 'em for 'tis raining abroad, pelting out of the heavens. He tells me hug the walls going up O'Connell Street to keep the papers dry. I'm to run in where there's a delivery, climb the outside steps, in the door, up the stairs, yell Paper, get the money they owe him for the week, down the stairs, give him the money and on to the next stop. Customers give him tips for his troubles and he keeps them for himself.
We make our way up O'Connell Avenue, out Ballinacurra, in by the South Circular Road, down Henry Street and back to the office for more papers. Uncle Pat wears a cap and a thing like a cowboy poncho to keep his papers dry but he complains his feet are killing him and we stop in a pub for a pint for his poor feet. Uncle Pa Keating is there all black and having a pint and he says to Uncle Pat, Ab, are you going to let that boy stand there with his face hanging out for the want of a lemonade?
Uncle Pat says, Wha? and Uncle Pa Keating gets impatient. Christ, he's dragging your feckin' papers all over Limerick and you can't-Oh, never mind. Timmy, give the child a lemonade. Frankie, don't you have a raincoat at home?
No, Uncle Pa.
You're not supposed to be out in this weather. You're drenched entirely. Who sent you out in this muck?
Grandma said I had to help Uncle Pat because of his bad leg. Course she did, the oul' bitch, but don't tell them I said that. Uncle Pat is struggling off the seat and gathering up his papers.
Come on, 'tis gettin' dark.
He hobbles along the streets calling, Anna Lie Sweets Lie, which
doesn't sound a bit like Limerick Leader and it doesn't matter because everyone knows this is Ab Sheehan that was dropped on his head. Here, Ab, give us a Leader, how's your poor leg, keep the change an' get yourself a fag for 'tis an awful feckin' night to be out sellin' the feckin' papers.
Tanks, says Ab, my uncle. Tanks, tanks, tanks, and it's hard to keep up with him on the streets bad as his leg is. He says, How many Leaders have you under your oxter?
One, Uncle Pat.
Take that Leader in to Mr. Timoney. He owes me for a fortnight now. Get that money an' there's a tip. He's a good man for the tip an' don't be shovin' it in your pocket like your cousin Gerry. Shoved it in his pocket, the little bugger.
I bang on the door with the knocker and there's a great howl from a dog so big he makes the door shake. A man's voice says, Macushla, quit the bloody racket or I'll give you a good fong in the arse for yourself. The racket stops, the door opens and the man is there, white hair, thick glasses, white sweater, a stick in his hand. He says, Who is it? Who do we have?
The paper, Mr. Timoney.
We don't have Ab Sheehan here, do we?
I'm his nephew, sir.
Is it Gerry Sheehan we have here?
No, sir. I'm Frank McCourt.
Another nephew? Does he make them? Is there a little nephew factory
in the backyard? Here's the money for the fortnight and give me the paper
or keep it. What's the use? I can't read anymore and Mrs. Minihan that's supposed to read to me didn't come. Legless with the sherry, that's what she is. What's your name?
Frank, sir.
Can you read?
I can, sir.
Do you want to earn a sixpence?
I do, sir.
Come here tomorrow. Your name is Francis, isn't it? Frank, sir.
Your name is Francis. There was never a St. Frank. That's a name for gangsters and politicians. Come here tomorrow at eleven and read to me.
I will, sir.
Are you sure you can read?
I am, sir.
You can call me Mr. Timoney.
I will, Mr. Timoney.
Uncle Pat is mumbling at the gate, rubbing his leg. Where's me
money an' you're not supposed to be chattin' with the customers an' me here with the leg destroyed be the rain. He has to stop at the pub at Punch's Cross to have a pint for the destroyed leg. After the pint he says he can't walk another inch and we get on a bus. The conductor says, Fares, please, fares, but Uncle Pat says, Go 'way an' don't be botherin' me, can't you see the state o' me leg?
Oh, all right, Ab, all right.
The bus stops at the O'Connell Monument and Uncle Pat goes to the Monument Fish and Chip Café where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger. He gets a shilling's worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to Grandma's door he gives me a threepenny bit, tells me meet him again next Friday and go home now to my mother.
The dog Macushla is lying outside Mr. Timoney's door and when I open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and she'd eat my face if Mr. Timoney didn't come out and flail at her with his stick and yell, Come in out of it, ye hoor, ye overgrown man eatin' bitch. Didn't you have your breakfast, you hoor? Are you all right, Francis? Come in. That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays. Sit down and read to me.
The Limerick Leader, Mr. Timoney?
No, not the bloody Limerick Leader. I wouldn't wipe the hole of my arse with the Limerick Leader. There's a book over there on the table, Gulliver's Travels. That's not what I want you to read. Look in the back for another thing, A Modest Proposal. Read that to me. It begins, It is a melancholy object to those who walk... Do you have that? I have the whole bloody thing in my head but I still want you to read to me.
He stops me after two or three pages. You're a good reader. And what do you think of that, Francis, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, eh? Macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump Irish infant, wouldn't you, you oul' hoor?
He gives me sixpence, and tells me return next Saturday.
Mam is delighted I earned sixpence for reading to Mr. Timoney and what was it he wanted read, the Limerick Leader? I tell her I had to read A Modest Proposal from the back of Gulliver's Travels and she says, That's all right, 'tis only a children's book. You'd expect him to want something strange for he's a little off in the head after years in the sun in the English army in India and they say he was married to one of them Indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance. That's the kind of thing that would drive you to children's books. She knows this Mrs. Minihan who lives next door to Mr. Timoney and used to clean house but couldn't stand it anymore the way he laughed at the Catholic Church and said one man's sin was another man's romp. Mrs. Minihan didn't mind the odd drop of sherry of a Saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a Buddhist, which he said he was himself and the Irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins float down the Shannon and far out to sea.
The next Friday Declan Collopy from the Confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle Pat Sheehan. Hoi, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' with Ab Sheehan?
He's my uncle.
You're supposed to be at the Confraternity.
I'm working, Declan.
You're not supposed to be working. You're not even ten and you're
destroyin' the perfect attendance in our section. If you're not there next Friday I'll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me?
Uncle Pat says, Go 'way, go 'way, or I'll walk on you.
Ah, shut up, Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage I can't see him anymore. I go at him with arms and legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can't touch him. He says, You mad feckin' eejit. I'll destroy you in the Confraternity, and he runs away.
Uncle Pat says, You shouldn't be fightin' like that an' you dropped all me papers an' some o' them is wet an' how am I supposed to sell wet papers, and I wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after I stood up to Declan Collopy.
At the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence. He complains it's too much money and it's all my mother's fault for going on to Grandma about the low pay.
Mam is delighted I'm getting sixpence on Fridays from Uncle Pat and sixpence on Saturdays from Mr. Timoney. A shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the Dead End Kids at the Lyric after I'm finished the reading.
Next morning Mr. Timoney says, Wait till we get to Gulliver, Francis. You'll know Jonathan Swift is the greatest Irish writer that ever lived, no, the greatest man to put pen to parchment. A giant of a man, Francis. He laughs all through A Modest Proposal and you'd wonder what he's laughing at when it's all about cooking Irish babies. He says, You'll laugh when you grow up, Francis.
You're not supposed to talk back to grown-ups but Mr. Timoney is different and he doesn't mind when I say, Mr. Timoney, big people are
always telling us that. Oh, you'll laugh when you grow up. You'll understand when you grow up. Everything will come when you grow up.
He lets out such a roar of a laugh I think he's going to collapse. Oh, Mother o' God, Francis. You're a treasure. What's up with you? Do you have a bee up your arse? Tell me what's up.
Nothing, Mr. Timoney.
I think you have the long puss, Francis, and I wish I could Go over to the mirror on the wall, Snow White, and tell me if you the long puss. Never mind. Just tell me what's up.
Declan Collopy was at me last night and I got into a fight.
He makes me tell him about the Confraternity and Declan and
uncle Pat Sheehan, who was dropped on his head, and then he tells
knows my uncle Pa Keating, who was gassed in the war and works in
works. He says, Pa Keating is a jewel of a man. And I'll tell you
I'll do, Francis. I'll talk to Pa Keating and we'll go to the crawthumpers at the Confraternity. I'm a Buddhist myself and I don't hold with fighting but I haven't lost it. They're not going to interfere with my little reader, oh, by Jesus, no.
Mr. Timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and I can say what I feel. Dad would never talk to me like Mr. Timoney. He'd say, Och, aye, and go for a long walk.
Uncle Pat Sheehan tells Grandma he doesn't want me to help with the papers anymore, he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks I should be giving him some of my Saturday morning sixpence anyway since I'd never have the reading job without him.
A woman next door to Mr. Timoney tells me I'm wasting my time knocking on the door, Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and Mr. Timoney couldn't stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down. You can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics around him. Mr. Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless or demented.
That's the end of my Saturday sixpence but I'll read to Mr. Timoney money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next door goes in, I climb in Mr. Timoney's window for Gulliver'sTravels and walk miles to the City Home so that he won't miss his reading. The man at the gate says, What? You want to come in an' read to an oul' man? Is it coddin' me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards.
Could I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr. Timoney? Leave it. Leave it for Jaysus sake an' don't be botherin' me. I'll send it up to him.
And he laughs.
Mam says, What's up with you? Why are you moping? And I tell her how Uncle Pat doesn't want me anymore and how they put Mr. Timoney in the City Home for laughing just because Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun. She laughs too and I'm sure the world is gone mad. Then she says, Ah, I'm sorry and it's a pity you lost two jobs. You might as well start going to the Confraternity again to keep The Posse away and, worse, the director, Father Gorey.
Declan tells me sit in front of him and if there's any blaguarding he'll break my feckin' neck for he'll be watching me as long as he's
see it. have
my
me he
the gas
what
prefect and no little shit like me is going to keep him from a life in linoleum.
Mam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and she's moving her bed to the kitchen. She laughs, I'll come back up to Sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door. School is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesn't have to get up for us. Dad lights the fire, makes the tea, cuts the bread, makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play. He lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when there's no school. We're ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake.
Then one day in July he says we can't go downstairs. We have to stay up here and play.
Why, Dad?
Never mind. Play here with Malachy and Michael and you can go down later when I tell you.
He stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs. We push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend we're in a tent, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. We hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails.
Then there's a baby's cry and Malachy says, Dad, did Mam get a new
baby?
Och, aye, son.
I'm older so I tell Malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but Malachy doesn't understand because he's only eight going on nine and I'll be ten next month.
Mam is in the bed with the new baby. He has a big fat face and he's red all over. There's a woman in the kitchen in a nurse's uniform and we know she's there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel. We want to tickle the baby but she says, No, no, ye can look at him but don't lay a finger.
Don't lay a finger. That's the way nurses talk.
We sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he won't even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play.
In a few days Mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire. His eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound, his belly shakes and that makes us laugh. Dad tickles him and sings a Scottish song, Oh, oh, stop your ticklin', Jock, Stop your ticklin', Jock.
Stop your ticklin',
Ickle ickle icklin
Stop your ticklin', Jock.
Dad has a job so Bridey Hannon is able to visit Mam and the baby any time she likes and for once Mam doesn't tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things. They sit by the fire smoking and talking about names. Mam says she likes the names Kevin and Sean but Bridey says, Ah, no, there's too many of them in Limerick. Jesus, Angela, if you stuck your head out the door and called, Kevin or Sean, come in for your tea, you'd have half o' Limerick running to your door.
Bridey says if she had a son which please God she will some day she'll call him Ronald because she's mad about Ronald Colman that you see in the Coliseum Cinema. Or Errol, now that's another lovely name, Errol Flynn.
Mam says, Will you go way outa that, Bridey. I'd never be able to stick my head out the door and say, Errol, Errol, come in for your tea. Sure the poor child would be a laughingstock.
Ronald, says Bridey, Ronald. He's gorgeous.
No, says Mam, it has to be Irish. Isn't that what we fought for all these years? What's the use of fighting the English for centuries if we're going to call our children Ronald?
Jesus, Angela, you're starting to talk like himself with his Irish this and his English that.
Still an' all, Bridey, he's right.
Suddenly Bridey is gasping, Jesus, Angela, there's something wrong with that child. Mam is out of the chair, hugging the child, moaning. Oh, Jesus, Bridey, he's choking.
Bridey says, I'll run for my mother, and she's back in a minute with Mrs. Hannon. Castor oil, says Mrs. Hannon. Do you have it? Any oil. Cod liver oil? That'll do.
She pours the oil into the baby's mouth, turns him over, presses on his back, turns him back over, sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball. That's it now, she says. The milk. It collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil.
Mam is crying, Jesus, I nearly lost him. Oh, I'd die so I would.
She's clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank Mrs. Hannon.
Yerra, don't mention it, missus. Take the child and get back into that bed for the two o' ye had a great shock.
While Bridey and Mrs. Hannon are helping Mam to the bed I notice spots of blood on her chair. Is my mother bleeding to death? Is it all right to say, Look, there's blood on Mam's chair? No, you can't say anything because they always have secrets. I know if you say anything the grown-up people will tell you, Never mind, you're always gawking, none of your business, go out and play.
I have to keep it inside or I can talk to the angel. Mrs. Hannon and Bridey leave and I sit on the seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold and there's no light, no voice. I'm sure he's gone forever and I wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten.
Mam doesn't bleed to death. She's out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of escape even on the Judgment Day.
Grandma is there to help and she says, That's right, no hope in heaven for the infant that's not baptized.
Bridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that.
He has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you'd have all kinds of babies clamorin' to get into heaven, Protestants an' everything, an' why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years?
The babies didn't do it, says Bridey. They're too small.
They would if they got the chance, says Grandma. They're trained for it.
They dress the baby in the Limerick lace dress we were all baptized in. Mam says we can all go to St. Joseph's and we're excited because there will be lemonade and buns after.
Malachy says, Mam, what's the baby's name?
Alphonsus Joseph.
The words fly out of my mouth, That's a stupid name. It's not even
Irish.
Grandma glares at me with her old red eyes. She says, That fella
needs a good clitther on the gob. Mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen. My heart is pounding and I want to cry but I can't because my father isn't there and I'm the man of the family. Mam says, You go upstairs with your big mouth and don't move from that room.
I stop at the seventh step but it's still cold, no light, no voice.
The house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel. I sit and wait upstairs, knocking the fleas off my arms and legs, wishing I had Dad here, thinking of my little brother and his foreign name, Alphonsus, an affliction of a name.
In awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea, sherry, lemonade, buns, and isn't that child the loveliest little fella in the world, little Alphie, foreign name but still an' all still an' all not a sound outa him the whole time he's that good-natured God bless him sure he'll live forever with the sweetness that's in him the little dote spittin' image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an' gone.
Mam calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun.
I don't want it. You can keep it.
I said come down this minute for if I have to climb these stairs I'll warm your behind and you'll rue the day.
Rue? What's rue?
Never mind what's rue. Come down here at once.
Her voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down.
In the kitchen Grandma says, Look at the long puss on him. You'd
think he'd be happy for his little brother except that a boy that's going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an' I know for didn't I have two of 'em.
The lemonade and bun are delicious and Alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction.
Grandpa in the North sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby Alphie. Mam wants to cash it but she can't go far from the bed. Dad says he'll cash it at the post office. She tells Malachy and me to go with him. He cashes it and tells us, All right, boys, go home and tell your mother I'll be home in a few minutes.
Malachy says, Dad, you're not to go to the pub. Mam said you're to bring home the money. You're not to drink the pint.
Now, now, son. Go home to your mother. Dad, give us the money. That money is for the baby.
Now, Francis, don't be a bad boy. Do what your father tells you.
He walks away from us and into South's pub. Mam is sitting by the fireplace with Alphie in her arms. She shakes her head. He went to the pub, didn't he? He did. I want ye to go back down to that pub and read
him out of it. I want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby. Ye are to tell the world there isn't a scrap of food in this house, not a lump of coal to start the fire, not a drop of milk for the baby's bottle.
We walk through the streets and Malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice, Dad, Dad, that five pounds is for the new baby. That's not for the drink. The child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and you're drinking the pint.
He's gone from South's pub. Malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but I tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before Dad drinks the whole five pounds. We can't find him in other pubs either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month. We have to tell Mam there's no sign of him and she tells us we're pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I'd search every pub in Limerick. I'd tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try Naughton's fish and chip shop.
I have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can't stray far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men's lavatories. I'm hungry but I'm afraid to go home till I find my father. He's not in Naughton's fish and chip shop but there's a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don't get them the cat will so I shove them under my jersey and I'm out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I'm in a state of sin for stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it's Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my soul after my feed.
The Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a drunken man.
Why, my child?
I was hungry, Father.
And why were you hungry?
There was nothing in my belly, Father.
He says nothing and even though it's dark I know he's shaking his
head. My dear child, why can't you go home and ask your mother for something? Because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs, Father, and I couldn't find him and she hasn't a scrap in the house because he's drinking the five pounds Grandpa sent from the North for the new baby and she's raging by the fire because I can't find my father.
I wonder if this priest is asleep because he's very quiet till he says, My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet. Do you understand me, my child?
I tell him I do but I don't.
Go home, child. Pray for me.
No penance, Father?
No, my child.
I stole the fish and chips. I'm doomed.
You're forgiven. Go. Pray for me. He blesses me in Latin, talks to
himself in English and I wonder what I did to him. I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket. I'm not hungry now so I can go up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson's, how could I miss him with his singing, 'Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise Would be shining at me out of somebody's eyes.
'Tis my private affair what my feelings would be While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me.
My heart is banging away in my chest and I don't know what to do because I know I'm raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but I don't because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and if he's there drunk and buying pints with the baby's money he has that look in his eyes Eugene had when he searched for Oliver and I might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that I never saw him couldn't find him.
She's in the bed with the baby. Malachy and Michael are up in Italy asleep. I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because it's bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say.
VIII
I'm ten years old and ready to go to St. Joseph's Church for my Confirmation. In school the master, Mr. O'Dea, prepares us. We have to know all about Sanctifying Grace, a pearl of great price, bought for us by Jesus in His dying. Mr. O'Dea's eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with Confirmation we will become part of Divinity. We will have the Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, the Fear of the Lord. Priests and masters tell us Confirmation means you're a true soldier of the Church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case we're invaded by Protestants or Mahommedans or any other class of a heathen. More dying. I want to tell them I won't be able to die for the Faith because I'm already booked to die for Ireland.
Mikey Molloy says, Is it jokin' you are? That thing about dying for the Faith is all a cod. 'Tis only a saying they made up to frighten you. Ireland too. No one dies for anything anymore. All the dying is done. I wouldn't die for Ireland or the Faith. I might die for my mother but that's all.
Mikey knows everything. He's going on fourteen. He gets the fits. He has visions.
The grown-ups tell us it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith, only we're not ready for that yet because Confirmation day is like First Communion day, you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money, The Collection.
That's where poor Peter Dooley comes in. We call him Quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of Notre Dame, whose real name we know is Charles Laughton.
Quasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and it's a sin to question what's sent. Quasimodo is old, he's fifteen. His red hair sticks up in all directions. He has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much he's constantly tapping his temple to keep it where it's supposed to be. His right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when he'll fall. That's when you're surprised. He curses his leg, he curses the world, but he curses in a lovely English accent which he got from the radio, the BBC. Before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, Here's me head, me arse is coming. When he was twelve Quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the BBC in London reading the news?
But you can't get to London without money and that's why he hobbles up to us that Friday, the day before Confirmation. He has an idea for Billy and me. He knows the next day we'll be getting Confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each he'll let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters' naked bodies when they take their weekly wash. I sign right away. Billy says, I have my own sister. Why should I pay to see your naked sisters?
Quasimodo says that looking at your own sister's naked body is the worst sin of all and he's not sure if there's a priest in the world can forgive you, that you might have to go to the bishop, who everyone knows is a holy terror.
Billy signs.
Friday night we climb the wall of Quasimodo's backyard. It's a lovely night with the June moon floating high over Limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the Shannon River. Quasimodo is about to let Billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but Mikey Molloy the Fit himself hissing at Quasimodo, Here's a shilling, Quasimodo. Let me up the spout. Mikey is fourteen now, bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal. He's black from the coal like Uncle Pa Keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip, which means he could have the fit anytime.
Quasimodo says, Wait, Mikey. They're first. Wait, my arse, says Mikey, and he's away up the spout. Billy complains but Quasimodo shakes his head, I can't help it. He comes every week with the shilling. I have to let him up the spout or he'll beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats. The Fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand. The other hand is in his pocket moving, moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak Quasimodo hisses, Molloy, there's to be no whankin' up the spout. He hops around the yard cackling. His BBC accent is gone and he's pure Limerick. Jaysus, Molloy, come down off that spout or I'll tell me mother. Mikey's hand goes faster in his pocket, so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and Mikey is rolling on the ground yelping, I'm dead. I'm destroyed. Oh, God. You can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue.
Quasimodo's mother comes screaming through the door, What in the name of Jesus! and the kitchen light fills the yard. The sisters are squawking from the window above. Billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall. She tells him run to O'Connor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for Mikey. She screams at us to get into the kitchen. She kicks Quasimodo into the hall. He's on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in. Stay there till you come to your senses.
He's crying and calling to her in a pure Limerick accent. Ah, Mamma, Mamma, let me out. The rats is here. I only want to go to the BBC, Mamma. Aw, Jasus, Mamma, Jasus. I'll never let anyone up the spout again. I'll send money from London, Mamma. Mamma!
Mikey is still on his back, jerking and twisting around the yard. The ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons.
Our mothers are there in no time. Mrs. Dooley says, I'm disgraced, so I am, disgraced. My daughters can't wash theirselves of a Friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their Confirmation tomorrow.
But Mam says, I don't know about the rest of the world but I saved a whole year for Frank's Confirmation suit and I'm not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I'll have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona Dooley.
She drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn't look at Mona Dooley in her pelt.
I swear.
If you're lying you won't be in a state of grace for Confirmation tomorrow and that's the worst kind of sacrilege.
I swear.
Only the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that.
I swear.
All right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that
misfortunate Quasimodo Dooley.
We are all confirmed the next day. The bishop asks me a catechism
question, What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him, Honor thy father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the shilling anyway for his career at the BBC?
But I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph's with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I don't care. My father is working and I don't care. My mother kisses me and I don't care. The boys talk about The Collection and I don't care. My nose won't stop and Mam is worried I'll ruin my suit. She runs into the church to see if Stephen Carey, the sacristan, would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore. She says, Do you want to make your collection? and I tell her I don't care. Malachy says, Do, do, Frankie, and he's sad because I promised I'd take him to the Lyric Cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets. I want
to lie down. I could lie down there on the steps of St. Joseph's and sleep forever. Mam says, Grandma is making a nice breakfast, and the mention of food makes me so sick I run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and I don't care. Mam says she'd better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when there's a collection to be made.
She helps me take off my Confirmation suit and puts me to bed. She wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops. She brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and I have to throw up in the bucket. Mrs. Hannon comes in from next door and I can hear her say that's a very sick child and he should have a doctor. Mam says it's Saturday, the Dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor?
Dad comes home from his job at Rank's Flour Mills and tells Mam I'm going through a stage, growing pains. Grandma comes up and says the same thing. She says when boys go from the one number year, which is nine, to the two number year, which is ten, they're changing and prone to the nosebleed. She says I might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldn't do me one bit of harm.
The day passes and I'm in and out of sleep. Malachy and Michael come into the bed at night and I can hear Malachy say, Frankie is very hot. Michael says, He's bleeding on my leg. Mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it won't stop the bleeding. On Sunday morning there's blood on my chest and all around me. Mam tells Dad I'm bleeding through my bottom and he says I might have a case of the runs, which is common with the growing pains.
Dr. Troy is our doctor but he's away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on Monday has a smell of whiskey on him. He examines me and tells my mother I have a bad cold and keep me in bed. Days pass and I sleep and bleed. Mam makes tea and beef tea and I don't want it. She even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick. Mrs. Hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, see if Dr. Troy is back.
Mam comes with Dr. Troy. He feels my forehead, rolls up my eyelids, turns me over to see my back, picks me up and runs to his motor car. Mam runs after him and he tells her I have typhoid fever. Mam cries, Oh, God, oh, God, am I to lose the whole family? Will it ever end? She gets into the car, holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the Fever Hospital at the City Home.
The bed has cool white sheets. The nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun, Sister Rita, is all in white. Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over. I sleep and sleep but I'm awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand. Sister Rita says, You're getting blood, Francis. Soldier's blood from the Sarsfield Barracks.
Mam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying, You know, missus, this is very unusual. No one is ever allowed into the Fever Hospital for fear they'd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming. If he gets over this he'll surely recover.
I fall asleep. Mam is gone when I wake but there's movement in the room and it's the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they're waking
me and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with oil and praying in Latin. I know it's Extreme Unction and that means I'm going to die and I don't care. They wake me again to receive Communion. I don't want it, I'm afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it's gone.
It's dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He's holding my wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.
Sister Rita's white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window. She's holding my wrist, looking at her watch, smiling. Oh, she says, we're awake, are we? Well, Francis, I think we've come through the worst. Our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the Confraternity. Can you imagine that? Hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion.
My ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and I don't care about boys praying for me. I can hear the swish of Sister Rita's habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room. I fall asleep and when I wake it's dark and Dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine.
Son, are you awake?
I try to talk but I'm dry, nothing will come out and I point to my mouth. He holds a glass of water to my lips and it's sweet and cool. He presses my hand and says I'm a great old soldier and why wouldn't I? Don't I have the soldier's blood in me?
The tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone.
Sister Rita comes in and tells Dad he has to go. I don't want him to go because he looks sad. He's like Paddy Clohessy the day I gave him the raisin. When he looks sad it's the worst thing in the world and I start crying. Now what's this? says Sister Rita. Crying with all that soldier blood in you? There's a big surprise for you tomorrow, Francis. You'll never guess. Well, I'll tell you, we're bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning. Isn't that a treat? And your father will be back in a day or two, won't you, Mr. McCourt?
Dad nods and puts his hand on mine again. He looks at me, steps away, stops, comes back, kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and I'm so happy I feel like floating out of the bed.
The other two beds in my room are empty. The nurse says I'm the only typhoid patient and I'm a miracle for getting over the crisis.
The room next to me is empty till one morning a girl's voice says, Yoo hoo, who's there?
I'm not sure if she's talking to me or someone in the room beyond. Yoo hoo, boy with the typhoid, are you awake?
I am.
Are you better?
I am.
Well, why are you here?
I don't know. I'm still in the bed. They stick needles in me and
give me medicine.
What do you look like?
I wonder, What kind of a question is that? I don't know what to tell her.
Yoo hoo, are you there, typhoid boy?
I am.
What's your name?
Frank.
That's a good name. My name is Patricia Madigan. How old are you? Ten. Oh. She sounds disappointed.
But I'll be eleven in August, next month.
Well, that's better than ten. I'll be fourteen in September. Do you
want to know why I'm in the Fever Hospital? I do.
I have diphtheria and something else.
What's something else?
They don't know. They think I have a disease from foreign parts
because my father used to be in Africa. I nearly died. Are you going to tell me what you look like?
I have black hair.
You and millions.
I have brown eyes with bits of green that's called hazel.
You and thousands.
I have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where
they put in the soldier's blood.
Oh, God, did they?
They did.
You won't be able to stop marching and saluting.
There's a swish of habit and click of beads and then Sister Rita's
voice. Now, now, what's this? There's to be no talking between two rooms especially when it's a boy and a girl. Do you hear me, Patricia?
I do, Sister.
Do you hear me, Francis?
I do, Sister.
You could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries. You
could be saying the rosary. You could be reading The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart that's beside your beds. Don't let me come back and find you talking.
She comes into my room and wags her finger at me. Especially you, Francis, after thousands of boys prayed for you at the Confraternity. Give thanks, Francis, give thanks.
She leaves and there's silence for awhile. Then Patricia whispers, Give thanks, Francis, give thanks, and say your rosary, Francis, and I laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if I'm all right. She's a very stern nurse from the County Kerry and she frightens me. What's this, Francis? Laughing? What is there to laugh about? Are you and that Madigan girl talking? I'll report you to Sister Rita. There's to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus.
She plods out and Patricia whispers again in a heavy Kerry accent, No laughing, Francis, you could be doin' serious damage to your internal apparatus. Say your rosary, Francis, and pray for your internal apparatus.
Mam visits me on Thursdays. I'd like to see my father, too, but I'm out of danger, crisis time is over, and I'm allowed only one visitor. Besides, she says, he's back at work at Rank's Flour Mills and please God this job will last a while with the war on and the English desperate for flour. She brings me a chocolate bar and that proves Dad is working. She could never afford it on the dole. He sends me notes. He tells me my
brothers are all praying for me, that I should be a good boy, obey the doctors, the nuns, the nurses, and don't forget to say my prayers. He's sure St. Jude pulled me through the crisis because he's the patron saint of desperate cases and I was indeed a desperate case.
Patricia says she has two books by her bed. One is a poetry book and that's the one she loves. The other is a short history of England and do I want it? She gives it to Seamus, the man who mops the floors every day, and he brings it to me. He says, I'm not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid they'll know and I'll lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand, which I could easily do because there isn't a song ever written about Ireland's sufferings I don't know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too.
Oh, yes, he knows Roddy McCorley. He'll sing it for me right enough but he's barely into the first verse when the Kerry nurse rushes in. What's this, Seamus? Singing? Of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing. I have a good mind to report you to Sister Rita.
Ah, God, don't do that, nurse.
Very well, Seamus. I'll let it go this one time. You know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients.
When she leaves he whispers he'll teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when you're by yourself in a typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling Frankie you're a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says, You're a lovely man, Seamus. He smiles because he's an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, Here's the book, Frankie. Isn't it a great pity you have to be reading all about England after all they did to us, that there isn't a history of Ireland to be had in this hospital.
The book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait forever for his mother, Victoria, to die before he could be king. The book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read.
I do believe, induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy.
The history writer says this is what Catherine, who is a wife of Henry the Eighth, says to Cardinal Wolsey, who is trying to have her head cut off. I don't know what it means and I don't care because it's Shakespeare and it's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words. If I had a whole book of Shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year.
Patricia says she doesn't know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesn't care about Shakespeare, she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when I say that Patricia gets huffy and says that's the last poem she'll ever read to me. She says I'm always reciting the lines from Shakespeare and they make no sense either. Seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldn't be fighting over poetry because we'll have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married.
Patricia says she's sorry and I'm sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which I have to remember so I can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about, The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman came riding Riding riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door.
He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,
A coat of the claret velvet,
and breeches of brown doe skin,
They fitted with never a wrinkle,
his boots were up to the thigh.
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,
His pistol butts a-twinkle,
His rapier hilt a-twinkle,
under the jewelled sky.
Every day I can't wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so I can learn a new verse from Patricia and find out what's happening to the highwayman and the landlord's red lipped daughter. I love the poem because it's exciting and almost as good as my two lines of Shakespeare. The redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.
I'd love to do that myself, come by moonlight for Patricia in the next room not giving a fiddler's fart though hell should bar the way. She's ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from Kerry shouting at her, shouting at me, I told ye there was to be no talking between rooms. Dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa. I warned ye. And she calls out, Seamus, take this one. Take the by. Sister Rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him. We gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldn't. Take the by, Seamus, take him.
Ah, now, nurse, sure isn't he harmless. 'Tis only a bit o' poetry. Take that by, Seamus, take him at once.
He bends over me and whispers, Ah, God, I'm sorry, Frankie. Here's
your English history book. He slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed. He whispers that I'm a feather. I try to see Patricia when we pass through her room but all I can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow.
Sister Rita stops us in the hall to tell me I'm a great disappointment to her, that she expected me to be a good boy after what God had done for me, after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the Confraternity, after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the Fever Hospital, after the way they let my mother and father in to see me, a thing rarely allowed, and this is how I repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with Patricia Madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria. She says I'll have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and I should beg God's forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan English poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when I could have been praying or reading the life
of a saint. She made it her business to read that poem so she did and I'd be well advised to tell the priest in confession.
The Kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister. She tells me I better not get the notion she'll be running up to this part of the world every time I have a little pain or a twinge.
There are twenty beds in the ward, all white, all empty. The nurse tells Seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure I don't talk to anyone who might be passing the door, which is very unlikely since there isn't another soul on this whole floor. She tells Seamus this was the fever ward during the Great Famine long ago and only God knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night. She says 'twould break your heart to think of what the English did to us, that if they didn't put the blight on the potato they didn't do much to take it off. No pity. No feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward, children suffering and dying here while the English feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses, little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond, God bless us and save us and guard us from future famines.
Seamus says 'twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldn't want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him. The nurse takes my temperature, 'Tis up a bit, have a good sleep for yourself now that you're away from the chatter with Patricia Madigan below who will never know a gray hair.
She shakes her head at Seamus and he gives her a sad shake back.
Nurses and nuns never think you know what they're talking about. If you're ten going on eleven you're supposed to be simple like my uncle Pat Sheehan who was dropped on his head. You can't ask questions. You can't show you understand what the nurse said about Patricia Madigan, that she's going to die, and you can't show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad.
The nurse tells Seamus she has to go and he's to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward. Seamus tells me she's a right oul' bitch for running to Sister Rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms, that you can't catch a disease from a poem unless it's love ha ha and that's not bloody likely when you're what? ten going on eleven? He never heard the likes of it, a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the Limerick Leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and he'd lose it if ever Sister Rita found out. Anyway, Frankie, you'll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though I don't know about Patricia below, I don't know about Patricia, God help us.
He knows about Patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory. Seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and he's saying, 'Tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when you're lovely in yourself. She told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room, Frankie. She said 'twas all her fault.
It wasn't, Seamus.
I know and didn't I tell her that.
Patricia is gone and I'll never know what happened to the highwayman and Bess, the landlord's daughter. I ask Seamus but he doesn't know any poetry at all especially English poetry. He knew an Irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it. Still he'll ask the men in his local pub where there's always someone reciting something and he'll bring it back to me. Won't I be busy meanwhile reading my short history of England and finding out all
their perfidy. That's what Seamus says, perfidy, and I don't know
means and he doesn't know what it means but if it's something the
do it must be terrible.
He comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse. The doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck. They all say, And how's our little soldier today? A girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me. Seamus says she's not right in the head so don't say a word to her.
The July days are long and I fear the dark. There are only two ceiling lights in the ward and they're switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills. The nurse tells me go to sleep but I can't because I see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup Protestant soup any soup and I cover my face with the pillow hoping they won't come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week.
No, she didn't bring it. She had to send it in because I can't have any more visitors. Sister Rita tells me a visit to the Fever Hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with Patricia Madigan and that poem I can't have the privilege anymore. She says I'll be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast. I don't know why she says I have to learn how to walk when I've been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, See, you're a baby again.
I practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. I don't want to be a baby. I don't want to be in this empty ward with no Patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlord's daughter. I don't want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar.
Seamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end. Would I like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head? He stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites, Tlot- tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot in the echoing night!
Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!
Her eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight, Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.
He hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how Bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats.
Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine red was his velvet coat, When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on
about
what it
English
the highway, And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.
Seamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles. He says, There was no call at all to shift you up here away from Patricia when you didn't even know what happened to the highwayman and Bess. 'Tis a very sad story and when I said it to my wife she wouldn't stop crying the whole night till we went to bed. She said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman, they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the Irish, either. Now if you want to know any more poems, Frankie, tell me and I'll get them from the pub and bring 'em back in my head.
The girl with the blue dress who's not right in the head suddenly says one day, Would you like a book for to read? and she brings me The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss by E. Phillips Oppenheim, which is all about an Englishman who is fed up and doesn't know what to do with himself every day even though he's so rich he can't count his money. His manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says, Take it away, life is empty. He can't read his paper, he can't eat his egg, and he pines away. His doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the East End of London and he'll learn to love life, which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the West End which is the rich part because it's easier to help the poor and not be fed up when you're nice and comfortable.
Seamus likes me to tell him what I'm reading. He says that story about Mr. Ernest Bliss is a made-up story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know. It might be like that in England. You'd never find the likes of that in Ireland. If you didn't eat your egg here you'd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop.
I can't wait to go home and tell Malachy about this man who won't eat his egg. Malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen. He'll say I'm making it up but when I tell him this story is about an Englishman he'll understand.
I can't tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit. She says if you're finished with that book I'll bring you another one because there's a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days. She brings me a book called Tom Brown's School-Days, which is hard to read, and no end of books by P. G. Wodehouse, who makes me laugh over Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves and all the Mulliners. Bertie Wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what Jeeves might say. I wish I could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but I'm afraid the Kerry nurse or Sister Rita might find out and they'd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing. At night I lie in bed thinking about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters in P. G. Wodehouse. I can dream about the red lipped landlord's daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it. It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.
It's August and I'm eleven. I've been in this hospital for two months and I wonder if they'll let me out for Christmas. The Kerry nurse tells me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I'm alive at all at all and not be complaining.
I'm not complaining, nurse, I'm only wondering if I'll be home for Christmas.
She won't answer me. She tells me behave myself or she'll send Sister Rita up to me and then I'll behave myself.
Mam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and you're a great soldier, Frankie. The nurse lets me talk to her through the window and it's hard because the windows are high and I have to stand on Seamus's shoulders. I tell Mam I want to go home but she says I'm a bit too weak and surely I'll be out in no time. Seamus says, 'Tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now you'll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man.
After fourteen weeks Sister Rita tells me I can go home and aren't I a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. She tells me I was a very good patient, except for that little problem with the poem and Patricia Madigan, God rest her, and I'm invited to come back and have a big Christmas dinner in the hospital. Mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at Union Cross. She says, Take your time. After three and a half months we can spare an hour.
People are at their doors on Barrack Road and Roden Lane telling me it's grand to see me back, that I'm a great soldier, a credit to my father and mother. Malachy and Michael run up to me in the lane and say, God, you're walking very slow. Can't you run anymore?
It's a bright day and I'm happy till I see Dad sitting in the kitchen with Alphie on his lap and there's an empty feeling in my heart because I know he's out of work again. All along I was sure he had a job, Mam told me he did, and I thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes. He smiles at me and tells Alphie, Och, there's your big brother home from the hospital.
Mam tells him what the doctor said, that I'm to have plenty of nourishing food and rest. The doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again. Dad nods. Mam makes beef tea from a cube and Malachy and Mike watch me drink it. They say they'd like some too but Mam says go away, ye didn't have the typhoid. She says the doctor wants me to go to bed early. She tried to get rid of the fleas but they're worse than ever with the warm weather we're having. Besides, she says, they won't get much out of you all bones and little skin.
I lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasn't a sign of a flea. There was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead. There was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say, I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy, And saying that helps me fall asleep.
When Malachy and Michael get up for school in the morning Mam tells me I can stay in bed. Malachy is in fifth class now with Mr. O'Dea and he likes to tell everyone he's learning the big red catechism for Confirmation and Mr. O'Dea is telling them all about state of grace and Euclid and how the English tormented the Irish for eight hundred long years.
I don't want to stay in bed anymore. The October days are lovely and I want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house. Mikey Moloney brings me P. G.
Wodehouse books his father gets from the library and I have great days with Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and all the Mulliners. Dad lets me read his favorite book, John Mitchel's Jail Journal, which is all about a great Irish rebel the English condemned to exile in Van Diemen's land in Australia. The English tell John Mitchel he's free to come and go as he pleases all over Van Diemen's land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he won't try to escape. He gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the English magistrate and says, I'm escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad says he doesn't mind if I read silly English books by P. G. Wodehouse as long as I don't forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for Ireland.
I can't stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy's School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, says he's sorry, I've missed over two months of school and I have to be put back in fifth class. Mam says surely I'm ready for sixth class. After all, she says, he's missed only a few weeks. Mr. O'Halloran says he's sorry, take the boy next door to Mr. O'Dea.
We walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don't want to be in fifth class. Malachy is in that class and I don't want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He didn't. I'm older. I'm not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but I'm older.
Mam says, It won't kill you.
She doesn't care and I'm put into that class with Malachy and I know all his friends are there sneering at me because I was put back. Mr. O'Dea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or I'll feel the end of his ash plant.
Then a miracle happens and it's all because of St. Francis of Assisi, my favorite saint, and Our Lord Himself. I find a penny in the street that first day back at school and I want to run to Kathleen O'Connell's for a big square of Cleeves' toffee but I can't run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes I have to hold on to a wall. I'm desperate for the Cleeves'toffee but I'm also desperate to get out of fifth class.
I know I have to go to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi. He's the only one who will listen but he's at the other end of Limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there, sitting on steps, holding on to walls. It's a penny to light a candle and I wonder if I should just light the candle and keep the penny. No, St. Francis would know. He loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but he's not a fool. I light the candle, I kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where I'm stuck with my brother, who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back. St. Francis doesn't say a word but I know he's listening and I know he'll get me out of that class. It's the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue, sitting on steps, holding on to walls, when I could have gone to St. Joseph's Church and lit a candle to the Little Flower or the Sacred Heart of Jesus Himself. What's the use of being named after him if he's going to desert me in my hour of need?
I have to sit in Mr. O'Dea's class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year. I'd like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says, Be quiet, let your brother answer. He gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them. He
dictates to them in Irish and makes me correct what they've written. Then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all I learned from him last year. He tells the class, Frank McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year. He's going to write a composition on Our Lord, aren't you, McCourt? He's going to tell us what it would be like if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick which has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family and is the holiest city in Ireland. We know that if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick He would never have been crucified because the people of Limerick were always good Catholics and not given to crucifixion. So, McCourt, you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow.
Dad says Mr. O'Dea has a great imagination but didn't Our Lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking Him in Limerick on top of it with the damp from the River Shannon. He puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and I have to think about Our Lord by myself and wonder what I'm going to write tomorrow.
The next day Mr. O'Dea says, All right, McCourt, read your composition to the class.
The name of my composition is-
The title, McCourt, the title.
The title of my composition is, ""Jesus and the Weather. ""
What?
""Jesus and the Weather. ""
All right, read it.
This is my composition. I don't think Jesus Who is Our Lord would
have liked the weather in Limerick because it's always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp. My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers. When you look at pictures of Jesus He's always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet. It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions.
Anytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End.
Mr. O'Dea is quiet and gives me a strange look and I'm worried because when he's quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer. He says, McCourt, who wrote that composition?
I did, sir.
Did your father write that composition? He didn't, sir.
Come here, McCourt.
I follow him out the door, along the hall to the headmaster's room. Mr. O'Dea shows him my composition and Mr. O'Halloran gives me the strange look, too. Did you write this composition?
I did, sir.
I'm taken out of the fifth class and put into Mr. O'Halloran's sixth class with all the boys I know, Paddy Clohessy, Fintan Slattery, The Question Quigley, and when school is over that day I have to go back down to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or something bad.
Mr. Thomas L. O'Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there's a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. He knows what we call him and he says, Yes, I'm Hoppy and I'll hop on you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don't pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical order. He makes charts of Irish grammar, Irish history and algebra at home, hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases, conjugations and declensions of Irish, famous names and battles, proportions, ratios, equations. We have to know all the important dates in Irish history. He tells us what is important and why. No master ever told us why before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the head. Hoppy doesn't call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesn't go into a rage. He's the only master who stops and says, Do ye understand what I'm talking about? Do ye want to ask a question?
It's a shock to everyone when he says, the Battle of Kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in Irish history, a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides.
Cruelty on both sides? The Irish side? How could that be? All the other masters told us the Irish always fought nobly, they always fought the fair fight. He recites and makes us remember, They went forth to battle, but they always fell, Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields.
Nobly they fought and bravely, but not well, And sank heart wounded by a subtle spell.
If they lost it was because of traitors and informers. But I want to know about these Irish atrocities.
Sir, did the Irish commit atrocities at the Battle of Kinsale?
They did, indeed. It is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the English.
Mr. O'Halloran can't lie. He's the headmaster. All these years we were told the Irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the English hanged them. Now Hoppy O'Halloran is saying the Irish did bad things. Next thing he'll be saying the English did good things. He says, You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and
bought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.
He calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes. He wants to know why they're broken or why we have no shoes at all. He tells us this is a disgrace and he's going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter. He gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over Limerick for Leamy's School boot fund, first prize five pounds, five prizes of a pound each. Eleven boys with no boots get new boots. Malachy and I don't get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over Limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots. Fintan Slattery says we gain plenary Indulgences for works of charity and Paddy Clohessy says, Fintan, would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself.
I know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? He lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that won't wake up the rest of the family. Mikey Molloy stole Cuchulain, the Angel on the Seventh Step is gone someplace else, but my father in the morning is still mine. He gets the Irish Press early and tells me about the world, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. He says this war is none of our business because the English are up to their tricks again. He tells me about the great Roosevelt in Washington and the great De Valera in Dublin. In the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me I should die for Ireland. He tells me about the old days in Ireland when the English wouldn't let the Catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant, that the Catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned English, Irish, Latin and Greek. The people loved learning. They loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job. Men, women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head. The masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the English caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse. He tells me school is easy now, you don't have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of Ireland. I should be good in school and some day I'll go back to America and get an inside job where I'll be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket, one red and one blue, making decisions. I'll be in out of the rain and I'll have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want? He says you can do anything in America, it's the land of opportunity. You can be a fisherman in Maine or a farmer in California. America is not like Limerick, a gray place with a river that kills.
When you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything.
At night he helps us with our exercises. Mam says they call it homework in America but here it's exercises, the sums, the English, the Irish, the history. He can't help us with Irish because he's from the North and lacking in the native tongue. Malachy offers to teach him all
the Irish words he knows but Dad says it's too late, you can't teach an old dog a new bark. Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, Dad, tell us a story, he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes. After the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers. We say the Our Father, three Hail Marys, God bless the Pope. God bless Mam, God bless our dead sister and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says, Go to sleep, boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you're not good.
I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.
I feel sad over the bad thing but I can't back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head.
Day and night we're tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets. Mam says it's not the River Shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door. It's bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats.
There is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from Gabbett's coal yard. His name is Finn the Horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesn't take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house. The stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog, Lucky. He loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable. The horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up. He knows we're not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country.
Sometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where it's pitch dark and you can't see them. Even when we bring in a candle we can't find them because they dig holes everywhere and we don't know where to look. If we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless Lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them. We expect him to eat the rats but he'll leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea. People in the lane say that's a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the McCourts.
The minute there's a sign of a rat or a mention of one Mam is out the door and up the lane. She'd rather walk the streets of Limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can
never rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory there's always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner.
We fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory. We'd like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you can't when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets. Some families are worse than others and Dad hates all of them even though Mam tells him it's not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door. Dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we won't be disturbed by the stink.
The flies are nearly as bad as the rats. On warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory. If Mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and Dad says it's disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl, or what's left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have the fleas. Mam says there's one good thing about fleas, they're clean, but flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore. We can chase the rats and kill them.
We can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but there's nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets. If we're out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house, Bucket coming, close the door, close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets. There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick. Now with the war on and men sending money from England more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night. We know the families with the curry, we know the ones with the cabbage. Mam is sick all the time, Dad takes longer and longer walks into the country, and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory. Dad doesn't complain about the River Shannon anymore. He knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the Town Hall to complain. The man there says, Mister, all I can tell you is you can move. Dad says we can't afford to move and the man says there's nothing he can do. Dad says, This is not India. This is a Christian country. The lane needs more lavatories. The man says, Do you expect Limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway, that will be demolished after the war? Dad says that lavatory could kill us all. The man says we live in dangerous times.
Mam says it's hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the Christmas dinner but if I'm going to Christmas dinner at the hospital I'll have to wash myself from top to bottom. She wouldn't give it to Sister Rita to say I was neglected or ripe for another disease. She boils a pot of water early in the morning before Mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me. She scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles. She can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but I'll have to walk back and that will be good for me because I'll be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and she's determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of Our Lord with pig's head.
Next year we'll have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldn't we, isn't Limerick famous the world over for the ham?
Sister Rita says, Now would you look at this, our little soldier looking so healthy. No meat on the bones but still. Now tell me, did you go to Mass this morning?
I did, Sister.
And did you receive?
I did, Sister.
She takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that
chair it won't be long now till I get my dinner. She leaves and I wonder if I'll be eating with nuns and nurses or will I be in a ward with children having their Christmas dinner. In awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books. She places the tray on the side of a bed and I pull up a chair. She frowns at me and screws up her face. You, she says, that's your dinner an' I'm not bringin' you any books.
The dinner is delicious, turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, jelly and custard, and a pot of tea. The jelly and custard dish looks delicious and I can't resist it so I'll have it first there's no one there to notice but when I'm eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says, What are you doin'?
Nothing.
Yes, you are. You're atin' the sweet before the dinner, and she runs out calling, Sister Rita, Sister Rita, come in quick, and the nun rushes in, Francis, are you all right?
I am, Sister.
He's not all right, Sister. He do be atin' his jelly an custard before his dinner. That's a sin, Sister.
Ah, now, dear, you run along and I'll talk to Francis about that.
Do, Sister, talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin' their sweet before their dinner an' then where will we be?
Indeed, indeed, where will we be? Run along now.
The girl leaves and Sister Rita smiles at me. God love her, she doesn't miss a thing even in her confusion. We have to be patient with her, Francis, the way she's touched.
She leaves and it's quiet in that empty ward and when I'm finished I don't know what to do because you're not supposed to do anything till they tell you. Hospitals and schools always tell you what to do. I wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray. Are you finished? she says.
and I tells
I am.
Well, that's all you're gettin' an' now you can go home.
Surely girls who are not right in the head can't tell you go home
wonder if I should wait for Sister Rita. A nurse in the hallway
me Sister Rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered. It's a long walk from Union Cross to Barrack Hill and when I get
home my family are up in Italy and well into their pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes. I tell them about my Christmas dinner. Mam wants to know if I had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when I tell her I ate alone in a ward and that's no way to treat a child. She tells me sit down and have some pig's head and I force it into my mouth and I'm so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile.
It's early in the morning and there's a motor car outside our door, the first one we've ever seen in the lane. There are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane.
It's Finn the Horse. He's lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and there's white stuff like milk around his mouth. The stable man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this morning and it's strange because he's always up and ready for his feed. The men are shaking their heads. My brother Michael says to one of the men, Mister, what's up with Finn?
Sick horse, son. Go home.
The stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on him. He says to Michael, That horse is a goner. We have to shoot him.
Michael pulls at my hand. Frank, they're not to shoot him. Tell them. You're big.
The stable man says, Go home, boy. Go home.
Michael attacks him, kicks him, scrawbs the back of his hand, and the man sends Michael flying. Hould that brother of yours, he tells me, hould him.
One of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag, goes to Finn, puts it to his head and there's a sharp crack. Finn shivers. Michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says, The horse was sick, son. He's better off.
The men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take Finn away, he can't leave him alone or the rats will be at him. He wants to know if we'd keep an eye on the horse with our dog Lucky while he goes to the pub, he's blue mouldy for a pint.
No rat has a chance to get near Finn the Horse the way Michael is there with a stick small as he is. The man comes back smelling of porter and then there's the big lorry to take the horse away, a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to Finn's head. The three men and the stable man tie ropes around Finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at Finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood.
Ye are destroyin' that horse.
Can't ye have respect for the dead?
Go easy with that poor horse.
The stable man says, For the love o' Jaysus what are ye squawkin'
about? 'Tis only a dead horse, and Michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and Mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over Finn's body to escape. He comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves there's a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people.
IX
Mam says, Alphie is enough. I'm worn out. That's the end of it. No more children.
Dad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation.
Mam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me.
What is Dad to do? There's a war on. English agents are recruiting Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there's no shortage of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember you're Irish and lower class and don't try to rise above your station.
Families up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in England. They rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The boys get their hair cut on Saturdays, the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire. They're very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the Savoy Cinema where you'll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the Lyric Cinema and are never done shouting at the screen, the kind of people if you don't mind who are liable to cheer on the Africans when they throw spears at Tarzan or the Indians when they're scalping the United States Cavalry. The new rich people go home after Mass on Sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes, sweets and cakes galore, and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are. Some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home. The brave new rich will be seen at the Savoy Restaurant or the Stella drinking tea, eating little buns, patting their lips with serviettes if you don't mind, coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be. They have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going. They thank God for Hitler because if he hadn't marched all over Europe the men of Ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the Labour Exchange.
Some families sing,

Yip aye aidy aye ay,
We don't care about England or France, All we want is the German advance.
If there's a chill in the air they'll turn on the electric fire for the comfort that's in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the English women and children dying under the German bombs but look what England did to us for eight hundred years.
The families with fathers in England are able to lord it over the families that don't. At dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children, Mikey, Kathleen, Paddy, come in for yeer dinner. Come in for the lovely leg o'lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes.
Sean, Josie, Peggy, come in for yeer tea, come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have.
Brendan, Annie, Patsy, come in for the fried black puddin', the sizzlin' sausages and the lovely trifle soaked in the best of Spanish sherry.
At times like this Mam tells us to stay inside. We have nothing but bread and tea and she doesn't want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out, suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane. She says 'tis easy to see they're not used to having anything the way they brag about everything. 'Tis a real low-class mind that will call out the door and tell the world what they're having for the supper. She says 'tis their way of getting a rise out of us because Dad is a foreigner from the North and he won't have anything to do with any of them. Dad says all that food comes from English money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from Limerick anyway, people who profit from Hitler's war, people who will work and fight for the English. He says he'll never go over there and help England win a war. Mam says, No, you'll stay here where there's no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea. No, you'll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you. You'll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers. Every house in the lane has electricity and we're lucky if we have a candle. God above, if I had the fare I'd be off to England myself for I'm sure they need women in the factories.
Dad says a factory is no place for a woman.
Mam says, Sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man. I say to him, Why can't you go to England, Dad, so we can have
electricity and a wireless and Mam can stand at the door and tell the world what we're having at dinnertime?
He says, Don't you want to have your father here at home with you?
I do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to America.
He sighs, Och, aye, och, aye. All right he'll go to England after Christmas because America is in the war now and the cause must be just. He'd never go if the Americans hadn't gone in. He tells me I'll have to be the man of the house, and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in Coventry which, everyone says, is the most bombed city in England. The agent says, There's plenty of work for willing men. You can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up, mate, you'll be Rockefeller at the end of the war.
We're up early to see Dad off at the railway station. Kathleen O'Connell at the shop knows Dad is off to England and money will be flowing back so she's happy to let Mam have credit for tea, milk, sugar, bread, butter and an egg.
An egg.
Mam says, This egg is for your father. He needs the nourishment for the long journey before him.
It's a hard-boiled egg and Dad peels off the shell. He slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread. Mam says, Don't be such a fool. Dad says, What would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself? Mam has tears on her eyelashes. She pulls her chair over to the fireplace. We all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says, What are ye gawkin' at? and turns away to look into the ashes. Her
bread and egg are still on the table and I wonder if she has any plans for them. They look delicious and I'm still hungry but Dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea. She shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks, snuffling and crying. He sits opposite her a while, silent, till she looks up at the clock and says, 'Tis time to go. He puts on his cap and picks up his bag. Mam wraps Alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of Limerick.
There are other families in the streets. The going away fathers walk ahead, the mothers carry babies or push prams. A mother with a pram will say to other mothers, God above, missus, you must be fagged out carrying that child. Sure, why don't you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms.
Prams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody.
The men call to each other. Grand day, Mick. Lovely day for the journey, Joe. 'Tis, indeed, Mick. Arrah, we might as well have a pint before we go, Joe. We might as well, Mick. Might as well be drunk as the way we are, Joe.
They laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed.
In the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food. They're having the last pint, the last drop of whiskey on Irish soil, For God knows it might be the last we'll ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isn't it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe.
The women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, The first telegram money order I get I'll be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning.
I look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop, more salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea?
Some men are already too drunk to walk and the English agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train. The agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs. Come on, men. Miss this train and you'll miss a good job. Come on, men, we have the Guinness in England. We have the Jameson. Now, men, please, men. You're drinking your food money and you'll get no more.
The men tell the agents to kiss their Irish arses, that the agents are lucky they're alive, lucky they're not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to Ireland. And the men sing, On Mountjoy one Monday morning High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty.
The train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money Limerick will be turned into another New York. The men climb the station
steps and the women and children call after them, Kevin, love, mind yourself and don't be wearing damp shirts.
Dry your socks, Michael, or the bunions will destroy you entirely. Paddy, go easy on the drink, are you listenin', Paddy?
Dad, Dad, don't go, Dad.
Tommy, don't forget to send the money. The children are skin and
bones.
Peter, don't forget to be takin' the medicine for your weak chest,
God help us.
Larry, mind them bloody bombs.
Christy, don't be talkin' to them Englishwomen. They're full of
diseases.
Jackie, come back. Sure we'll manage somehow. Don't go, Jack-e-e,
Jack-e-e, oh, Jesus, don't go.
Dad pats our heads. He tells us remember our religious duties but,
above all, obey our mother. He stands before her. She has the baby Alphie in her arms. She says, Mind yourself. He drops the bag and puts his arms around her. They stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them. He nods, picks up his bag, climbs the steps to the station, turns to wave and he's gone.
Back at home Mam says, I don't care. I know it sounds extravagant but I'm going to light the fire and make more tea for it isn't every day your father goes to England.
We sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father, till Mam says, Don't cry, don't cry. Now that your father is gone to England surely our troubles will be over.
Surely.
Mam and Bridey Hannon sit by the fire upstairs in Italy smoking Woodbines, drinking tea, and I sit on the stairs listening. We have a father in England so that we can get all we want from Kathleen O'Connell's shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight. Mam tells Bridey she can't wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we don't have to share with half the world. We'll all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we won't be coming home from school famished. We'll have eggs and rashers on Sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner. We'll have electric light and why shouldn't we? Weren't Frank and Malachy born to it in America where everyone has it?
All we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door. Dad will have to settle into his job in England, buy work clothes and get a place to stay, so the first money order won't be big, three pounds or three pounds ten, but soon we'll be like other families in the lane, five pounds a week, paying off debts, buying new clothes, putting something in the savings against the time we'll pack up and move to England entirely and save there to go to America. Mam herself could get a job in an English factory making bombs or something and God knows we wouldn't know ourselves with the money pouring in. She wouldn't be happy if we grew up with English accents but better an English accent than an empty belly.
Bridey says it doesn't matter what class of an accent an Irishman has for he'll never forget what the English did to us for eight hundred long years.
We know what Saturdays are in the lane. We know some families like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. Downes
is a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a Friday and go home to his bed. We know men like him run to the post office the minute they're paid so their families won't know a minute of waiting or worry. Men like Mr. Downes send their sons RAF wings to wear on their coats. That's what we want and that's what we told Dad before he left, Don't forget the RAF badges, Dad.
We see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. They're happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss.
The families that get the early telegrams have that contented look. They'll have all day Saturday to enjoy the money. They'll shop, they'll eat, they'll have all day to think about what they'll do that night and that's almost as good as the thing itself because Saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week.
There are families don't get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look. Mrs. Meagher has waited at her door every Saturday for two months. My mother says she'd be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that. All the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy. Hoi, telegram boy, do you have anything for Meagher? and when he says no they say, Are you sure? and he'll say, Course I'm sure. I know what I have in my feckin' pouch.
Everyone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the Angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children.
Telegram boy, will you look in your pouch again? Please. Aw, God. I did. I have nothing for ye.
Aw, God, please look. Our name is Meagher. Will you look?
I know bloody well yeer name is Meagher and I looked.
The children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them, Jesus, will ye get away from me.
Once the Angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over. The ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didn't get the telegrams have to light candles and see if Kathleen O'Connell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of God and His Blessed Mother the telegram will come.
Mr. Meehan at the top of the lane went to England with Dad and when the telegram boy stops at Meehan's we know we'll be next. Mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she won't leave the chair by the fire in Italy till she has the telegram in her hand. The telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to Downeses'. He hands them their telegram, takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane. Malachy calls, Telegram boy, do you have something for McCourt? Ours is coming today. The telegram boy shakes his head and rides away.
Mam puffs on her Woodbine. Well, we have all day though I'd like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at Barry the butcher. She can't leave the fire and we can't leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we'd have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely. We'd have to watch the Meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for Sunday and sailing off to the films on Saturday night. No, we can't move an inch till that telegram boy comes. Mam says
don't be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the Angelus. We don't have a thing to worry about till six. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he'll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what 'tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul' shit over in England that never sent a penny. Mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that. The same telegram boy comes back just before the Angelus at six and tells us he asked Mrs. O'Connell at the post office if they had anything for McCourt all day and they didn't. Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael who is only five and won't understand anything till he's eleven like me wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.
You don't know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesn't come. You can't stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and you'd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread. You don't want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you don't want to hear the news from the BBC or Radio Eireann from other people's wirelesses. Mrs. Meagher and her children are gone in and there's only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen. They're ashamed too. They stay inside on Saturday nights and they don't even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the public assistance. Mam says that's the worst thing that could happen to any family. It's worse than going on the dole, it's worse than going to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it's worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers. It's the last thing you'd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage.
There's a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red and itching. Grandma says, Don't touch that sore and don't put water near it or it'll spread. If you broke your arm she'd say don't touch that with water it'll spread. The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now they're red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning. They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder. The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked eyes and she says it's my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to Malachy if he doesn't give over with the reading. You can see little Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely.
She's having tea with Mam and I hear her whisper, The thing to do is give him St. Anthony's spit.
What's that? says Mam.
Your fasting spit in the morning. Go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in
it.
But I'm always awake before Mam. I force my eyes open long before
she stirs. I can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit I open my eyes. God, she says, your eyes are open.
I think they're getting better.
That's good, and she goes back to bed.
The eyes don't heal and she takes me to the Dispensary where the
poor people see doctors and get their medicines. It's the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and there's no dole money, no wages.
There are benches along the walls by the doctors' offices. The benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments. Old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush, love, hush. There's a high platform in the middle of the Dispensary with a counter circling it chest high. When you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see Mr. Coffey or Mr. Kane. The women in the queue are like the women at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They wear shawls and they're respectful to Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane because if they're not they might be told go away and come back next week when it's this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane love to have a good laugh with the women. They'll decide if you're desperate enough for the public assistance or if you're sick enough to see a doctor. You have to tell them in front of everyone what's wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that. They'll say, And what is it you want, Mrs. O'Shea? A docket for the doctor, is it? And what is your trouble, Mrs. O'Shea? A pain, is it? A touch of the wind, maybe. Or maybe too much cabbage. Oh, the cabbage will do it right enough. They laugh and Mrs. O'Shea laughs and all the women laugh and say Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane are funny men, they'd give Laurel and Hardy a run for their money.
Mr. Coffey says, Now, woman, what's your name? Angela McCourt, sir.
And what's up with you?
'Tis my son, sir. He has two bad eyes.
Oh, by God, he does, woman. They're desperate looking eyes altogether. They look like two rising suns. The Japs could use him on their flag, ha ha ha. Did he pour acid on his face or what?
'Tis some class of infection, sir. He had the typhoid last year and then this came.
All right, all right, we don't need the life story. Here's your docket to Dr. Troy.
Two long benches are filled with patients for Dr. Troy. Mam sits next to a woman who has a big sore on her nose that won't go away. I tried everything, missus, every known cure on God's lovely earth. I'm eighty-three years of age and I'd like to go to my grave healthy. Is it too much to ask that I meet my Redeemer with a healthy nose? And what's up with yourself, missus?
My son. The eyes.
Ah, God bless us and save us, look at them eyes. They're the sorest two eyes I ever seen in me life. I never seen that color red before.
'Tis an infection, missus.
Sure there's a cure for that. You need the caul.
What's that now?
Babies are born with this thing on their heads, a class of a hood, rare and magical. Get a caul and put that on his head any day that has a three in it, make him hold his breath for three minutes even if you have to clap your hand over his face, sprinkle him with holy water three times head to toenail and his two eyes will shine in the dawn.
And where would I get a caul?
Don't all the midwives have cauls, missus. What's a midwife without a caul? It cures all classes of disease and keeps off more.
Mam says she'll talk to Nurse O'Halloran and see if she has a spare caul.
Dr. Troy looks at my eyes. Into the hospital with this boy at once. Take him to the eye ward at the City Home. Here's the docket to get him
in.
What does he have, Doctor?
The worst case of conjunctivitis I've ever seen in my life and
something else in there I can't make out. He needs the eye man.
How long will he be in, Doctor?
Only God knows that. I should have seen this child weeks ago. There are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with
bandages around their heads, black patches on their eyes, thick glasses. Some walk around tapping at beds with sticks. A man cries all the time that he'll never see again, he's too young, his children are babies, he'll never see them again. Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the Lord in vain. Stop that, Maurice, stop the blasphemy. You have your health. You're alive. We all have our problems. Offer it up and think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails in His poor hands and feet, the wound in His side. Maurice says, Oh, Jesus, look down and have pity on me. Sister Bernadette warns him if he doesn't mind his language they'll put him in a ward alone and he says, Heavenly God, and that isn't as bad as Jesus Christ so she's satisfied.
In the morning I have to go downstairs for drops. The nurse says, Sit in this high chair and here's a nice sweet. The doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it. He tells me put my head back, that's right, now open up, open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and it's a flame going through my skull. The nurse says, Open the other eye, come on be a good boy, and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull. She wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but I can barely see and I want to stick my face into an icy stream. The doctor says, Run along, be a man, be a good trooper.
The whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs. The other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but I don't want it with the way my skull is raging. I sit by my bed and a boy across the way says, Hoi, don't you want your dinner? I'll take it, and he comes for it.
I try to lie on the bed but a nurse says, Now, now, no lying on the bed in the middle of the day. Your case isn't that serious.
I have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black, black and brown and I'm sure I must be having a dream because Lord God above, is that the little fella with the typhoid, little Frankie, the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, is that yourself, Frankie, for wasn't I promoted out of the Fever Hospital, thank God, where there's every class of disease and you never know what germs you
might be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and what's up with you, Frankie, and the two eyes in your head all gone brown?
I have an infection, Seamus.
Yerra, you'll be over that before you're married, Frankie. The eyes need exercise. The blink is great value for the eyes. I had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him. He sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end. Wound up with powerful eyes, so he did.
I want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says, Now do you remember the poem, Frankie, the lovely poem of Patricia? He stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket
and says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes Seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem he'll have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasn't for Frankie McCourt and his typhoid there and poor Patricia Madigan with the dipteria that's gone God rest her he'd never know the poem and there I am famous in the eye ward of the City Home Hospital and all because of Seamus.
Mam can't come to visit every day, it's a long way out, she doesn't always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns. She thinks my eyes look better though you can't tell with all that brown stuff, which looks and smells like iodine and if it's anything like iodine it must burn. Still, they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure. She gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and there's a strange sight, Mr. Timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky. I want to talk to him and I have to ask Mam because you never know what's right or wrong in a hospital.
Mr. Timoney.
Who is it? Who do we have?
Frank McCourt, sir.
Francis, ah, Francis.
Mam says, I'm his mother, Mr. Timoney.
Well, then, the two of ye are blessed. I have neither kith nor kin
nor Macushla my dog. And what are you doing in this place, Francis?
I have an infection in my eyes.
Ah, Jesus, Francis, not the eyes, not the eyes. Mother of Christ,
you're too young for that.
Mr. Timoney, would you like me to read to you?
With them eyes, Francis? Ah, no, son, Save the eyes. I'm beyond
reading. In my head I have everything I need. I was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now I have a library in my head. The English shot my wife. The Irish put down my poor innocent Macushla. Isn't it a joke of a world?
Mam says, Terrible world but God is good.
Indeed, missus. God made the world, it's a terrible world, but God is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head. We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn't we, Francis?
We did, Mr. Timoney.
Mam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don't be crying over Mr. Timoney, he's not even your father. Besides you'll be ruining your eyes.
Seamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head. He says, You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you didn't like the one about the owl and the pussycat.
I'm sorry, Seamus.
I have it in my head, Frankie, and I'll say it for you if you don't say 'tis foolish.
I won't, Seamus.
He says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it. They want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, The Owl and the Pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat.
They took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar,
O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are.
What a beautiful Pussy you are.
They say it along with Seamus now and when it's finished they cheer and clap and Seamus laughs, delighted with himself. When he's gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are.
What a beautiful Pussy you are.
Then Seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and I'm afraid he's sacked over the poetry but he's smiling and telling me he's off to England to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change. He'll work for two months and bring the wife over and God might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria.
Good-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I'd write to you but I'll get the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes won't have a fool for a father.
I want to cry but you can't cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying, What's this what's this be a man, and nuns going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits with nails.
I'm a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even if there's still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs I'll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha.
Mr. Downes across the way comes back from England for his mother's funeral. He tells Mrs. Downes about my father. She tells Bridey Hannon and Bridey tells my mother. Mr. Downes says that Malachy McCourt is gone pure mad with the drink, that he squanders his wages in pubs all over Coventry, that he sings Irish rebel songs which the English don't mind because they're used to the way the Irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering, but they won't put up with any man that stands up in
a pub and insults the King and Queen of England, their two lovely daughters and the Queen Mother herself. Insulting the Queen Mother is going beyond the beyonds. What did she ever do to anyone, that poor old lady? Time after time Malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out. He's a regular disgrace, so he is, and Mr. Downes is glad McCourt is not a Limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city. The magistrates in Coventry are losing their patience and if Malachy McCourt doesn't stop the bloody nonsense he'll be kicked out of the country entirely.
Mam tells Bridey she doesn't know what she's going to do with these stories from England, she never felt so desperate in her life. She can see Kathleen O'Connell doesn't want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the St. Vincent de Paul Society want to know when she'll stop asking for charity especially with a husband in England. She's ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts, raggedy ganseys, broken shoes, holes in our stockings. She lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to England herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life. There might be bombs but she'd prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one.
No, no matter what she can't bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage. That might be all right if you had the likes of Boys' Town in America with a nice priest like Spencer Tracy but you could never trust the Christian Brothers out in Glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them.
Mam says there's nothing left but the Dispensary and the public assistance, the relief, and she's ashamed of her life to go and ask for it. It means you're at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers, knackers and street beggars in general. It means you have to crawl before Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane and thank God the Dispensary is at the other end of Limerick so that people in our lane won't know we're getting the relief.
She knows from other women it's wise to be there early in the morning when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane might be in a good mood. If you go late in the morning they're liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives don't wash our faces, don't comb our hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too healthy and you'd wonder why on this day of days they couldn't have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them where we're going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears.
There is a queue already outside the Dispensary. There are women like Mam with children in their arms, babies like Alphie, and children playing on the pavement. The women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle. There are old men and women huddled
against the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all. Mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open. A man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform, that Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond. A woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldn't Coffey and Kane bloody well hurry up with their tea. The man says she's a troublemaker but he won't take her name this time with the cold that's in the morning but if there's another word she'll be a sorry woman.
Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people. Mr. Kane puts on his glasses, takes them off, polishes them, puts them on, looks at the ceiling. Mr. Coffey reads papers, writes something, passes papers to Mr. Kane. They whisper to each other. They take their time. They don't look at us.
Then Mr. Kane calls the first old man to the platform. What's your
name?
Timothy Creagh, sir.
Creagh, hah? A fine old Limerick name you have there.
I do, sir. Indeed I do.
And what do you want, Creagh?
Ah, sure, I do be havin' them pains in me stomach again an' I'd
like to see Dr. Feeley.
Well, now, Creagh, are you sure it's not the pints of porter that
are going against your stomach.
Ah, no, indeed, sir. Sure I hardly touch the pint at all with the
pains. My wife is home in the bed and I have to take care of her too. There's great laziness in the world, Creagh. And Mr. Kane says to
the people on the queue, Did ye hear that, ladies? Great laziness, isn't there?
And the women say, Oh, there is, indeed, Mr. Kane, great laziness. Mr. Creagh gets his docket to see the doctor, the queue moves ahead
and Mr. Kane is ready for Mam.
The public assistance, is
'Tis, Mr. Kane.
And where's your husband?
Oh, he's in England, but-
England, is it? And where
that what you want, woman, the relief?
is the weekly telegram, the big five
pounds?
He didn't send us a penny in months, Mr. Kane.
Is that a fact? Well, we know why, don't we? We know what the men
of Ireland are up to in England. We know there's the occasional Limerickman seen trotting around with a Piccadilly tart, don't we?
He looks out at the people on the queue and they know they're supposed to say, We do, Mr. Kane, and they know they're supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform. They know he might turn them over to Mr. Coffey and he's notorious for saying no to everything.
Mam tells Mr. Kane that Dad is in Coventry and nowhere near Piccadilly and Mr. Kane takes off his glasses and stares at her. What's this? Are we having a little contradiction here?
Oh, no, Mr. Kane, God no.
I want you to know, woman, that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in England. I want you to know you're
taking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit.
Oh, yes, Mr. Kane.
And what's your name?
McCourt, sir.
That's not a Limerick name. Where did you get a name like that? My husband, sir. He's from the North.
He's from the North and he leaves you here to get the relief from
the Irish Free State. Is this what we fought for, is it? I don't know, sir.
Why don't you go up to Belfast and see what the Orangemen will do for you, ah?
I don't know, sir.
You don't know. Of course you don't know. There's great ignorance in the world.
He looks out at the people, I said there's great ignorance in the world, and the people nod their heads and agree there's great ignorance in the world.
He whispers to Mr. Coffey and they look at Mam, they look at us. He tells Mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband she's to drop all claims and give the money back to the Dispensary. She promises she will and we leave.
We follow her to Kathleen O'Connell's shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire. We climb the stairs to Italy and get the fire going and it's cozy when we have our tea. We're all very quiet, even the baby Alphie, because we know what Mr. Kane did to our mother.
X
It's cold and wet down in Ireland but we're up in Italy. Mam says we should bring the poor Pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window. After all he's a friend of the workingman, he's Italian, and they're a warm weather people. Mam sits by the fire, shivering, and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette. She says she feels a cold coming and she'd love to have a tarty drink, a lemonade. But there's no money in the house, not even for bread in the morning. She drinks tea and goes to bed.
The bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water. In the morning, she stays in bed, still shivering, and we keep quiet. If she sleeps long enough Malachy and I will be too late for school. Hours pass and still she makes no move and when I know it's well past school time I start the fire for the kettle. She stirs and calls for lemonade but I give her a jam jar of water. I ask her if she'd like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf. She looks flushed and it's odd she doesn't even mention cigarettes.
We sit quietly by the fire, Malachy, Michael, Alphie, myself. We drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can't laugh too much or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to school where we'll be killed for being late. We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at
O'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him.
Still, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread.
I put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick to keep myself warm against the February frost. You can look in people's windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good Catholics at their breakfast.
I try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother moaning for lemonade.
Lemonade. There's a van pulling away from South's pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isn't a soul on the street. In a second I have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and I saunter away trying to look innocent.
There's a bread van outside Kathleen O'Connell's shop. The back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread. The van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with Kathleen and it's no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread. It's wrong to steal from Kathleen with the way she's always good to us but if I go in and ask her for bread she'll be annoyed and tell me I'm ruining her morning cup of tea, which she'd like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you. It's easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession.
My brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread. We tear at the loaf because we're too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning's leaves. When my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I'll have to find more lemonade.
We put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. Joseph's Church where no one can follow you if you're a criminal, not even if you killed your own mother. Malachy and Michael look shocked over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the poor. Michael says I'm an outlaw and if they catch me they'll hang me from the highest tree in the People's Park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the Lyric Cinema. Malachy says I should make sure I'm in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging. I tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging. That's what priests are for.
Roddy McCorley had a priest and so did Kevin Barry. Malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry because they're not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up.
Alphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire. We put him into the bed with Mam so that he'll be warm though we don't want him to catch her disease and die. If she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and she'll blame me on top of it.
The three of us get back into our own bed, huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress. It's pleasant there till Michael starts to worry over Alphie getting Mam's disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw. He says it isn't fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore. He falls asleep from the worry and soon Malachy drifts off and I lie there thinking of jam. Wouldn't it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam. I can't remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and I wouldn't want to be like Jesse James blasting my way into a shop demanding jam. That would surely lead to a hanging.
There's a cold sun coming through the window and I'm sure it must be warmer outside and wouldn't my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam. They'd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging.
Mam is still asleep though her face is red and there's a strangling sound when she snores.
I have to be careful going through the street because it's a school day and if Guard Dennehy sees me he'll drag me off to school and Mr. O'Halloran will knock me all over the classroom. The guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear.
There's a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on Barrington Street. I pretend to knock on the door so that I can see what's in the box, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese, tomatoes and, oh, God, a jar of marmalade. I can't shove all that under my jersey. Oh, God. Should I take the whole box? The people passing by pay me no attention. I might as well take the whole box. My mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word.
Malachy and Michael are beside themselves when they see what's in the box and they're soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade. Alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly. We wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it.
Mam mumbles again for lemonade and I give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet. She calls for more and I mix it with water to stretch it because I can't be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs. We're having a fine time of it till Mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldn't God take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house? Michael wants to know if Mam will die and Malachy tells him you can't die till a priest comes. Then Michael wonders if we'll ever have a fire and hot tea again because he's freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from
olden times. Malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use Alphie's pram to carry the load. We should take Alphie with us because he's small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us. We try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls. Michael says he'll only get dirty again in the pram so what's the use of washing him. Michael is small but he's always saying remarkable things like that.
We push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or they'll call the proper authorities and it's a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldn't use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a Catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation. Malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says he'll never in his life ask the rich for anything again. He says there's no use asking anymore, that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want. Michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and Malachy and I can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around Alphie.
We collect that way from three houses but then Malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits Alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting Michael, still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids. Malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for Michael. We can't stop now with Alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us we're a disgrace to our mother and Ireland in general.
When we're back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he won't stop screaming till I give him bread and marmalade. I'm afraid Mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about Dad and drink and babies dead.
Malachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and Michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. The rich woman wrote down Michael's name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed.
Malachy barks at Michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything. She'll go now and tell on us and before we know it we'll have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us.
There's the banging on the door already. But it isn't a priest, it's Guard Dennehy. He calls up, Hello, hello, is anybody home? Are you there, Mrs. McCourt?
Michael knocks on the window and waves at the guard. I give him a good kick for himself and Malachy thumps him on the head and he yells, I'll tell the guard. I'll tell the guard. They're killing me, guard. They're thumping and kicking.
He won't shut up and Guard Dennehy shouts at us to open the door. I call out the window and tell him I can't open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease.
Where's your father?
He's in England.
Well, I'm coming in to talk to your mother.
You can't. You can't. She has the disease. We all have the disease.
It might be the typhoid. It might be the galloping consumption. We're getting spots already. The baby has a lump. It could kill.
He pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to Italy just as Alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt. He looks at him and my mother and us, takes off his cap and scratches his head. He says, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, this is a desperate situation. How did your mother get sick like that?
I tell him he shouldn't go near her and when Malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says we'll go to school no matter what, that we're on the earth to go to school the way he's on the earth to make sure we go to school. He wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell Grandma and Aunt Aggie to come to our house.
They scream at me and tell me I'm filthy. I try to explain that Mam has the disease and I'm worn out trying to make ends meet, keeping the home fires burning, getting lemonade for Mam and bread for my brothers. There's no use telling them about the marmalade for they'll only scream again. There's no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids.
They push me all the way back to the lane, barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of Limerick. Guard Dennehy is still scratching his poll. He says, Look at this, a disgrace. You wouldn't see the likes of this in Bombay or the Bowery of New York itself.
Grandma is wailing at my mother, Mother o' God, Angela, what's up with you in the bed? What did they do to you?
My mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade.
She wants lemonade, says Michael, and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and we're all outlaws now. Frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over Limerick.
Guard Dennehy looks interested and takes Michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing. Aunt Aggie says that's a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed. The guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor. He keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers. Desperadoes, he says, desperadoes.
The doctor comes with Aunt Aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia. We'd all like to go riding in the doctor's car but Aunt Aggie says, No, ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital.
I tell her not to bother. I'm eleven and I can easily look after my brothers. I'd be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed. But Grandma screams I will do no such a thing and Aunt Aggie gives me a thump for myself. Guard Dennehy says I'm too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but I have a promising future in both departments.
Get your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace.
She finds a rag and ties it around Alphie's bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram. Then she looks at us and wants to know why we're standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. I'm afraid she'll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it's all right, we have our clothes, they're on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, she says, put some sugar and water in the child's bottle. She tells me I have to push Alphie through the streets, she can't manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides 'tis a disgraceful looking object she'd be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see Alphie at all.
Grandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from Roden Lane to Aunt Aggie's flat in Windmill Street. Can't you push that pram properly? Jesus, you're going to kill that child. Stop goin' from side to side or I'll give you a good clitther on the gob. She won't come into Aunt Aggie's flat. She can't stand the sight of us one more minute. She's fed up with the whole McCourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from America, dishing out more money for funerals for dead children, giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages, helping Angela carry on while that blaguard from the North drinks his wages all over England. Oh, she's fed up, so she is, and off she goes across Henry Street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head, limping along in her black high laced boots.
When you're eleven and your brothers are ten, five and one, you don't know what to do when you go to someone's house even if she's your mother's sister. You're told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if it's not your house you don't know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull. She takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told. If you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you don't know what to answer because you don't know yourself. If you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think you're talking to in my kitchen? We have to stand and be quiet and that's hard when there's a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know she's on the chamber pot peeing away. I don't want to look at Malachy. If I do I'll smile and he'll smile and Michael will smile and there's danger we'll start laughing and if we do we won't be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie's big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot. I'm able to control myself. I won't laugh. Malachy and Michael won't laugh and it's easy to see we're all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with Aunt Aggie till Alphie in my arms smiles and says Goo goo and that sets us off. The three of us burst out laughing and Alphie grins with his dirty face and says Goo goo again till we're helpless and Aunt Aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all. She hits Malachy too and she tries to hit Michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she can't get at him. Come over here, she says, and I'll wipe that grin off your puss, but Michael keeps running around the table and she's too fat to catch him. I'll get you later, she says, I'll warm your arse, and you, Lord Muck, she says to me, put that child down on the floor over there by
the range. She puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and Alphie lies there with his sugary water and says Goo goo and smiles. She tells us take off every scrap of our clothes, get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies. We are not to come back into this house till we're spotless. I want to tell her it's the middle of February, it's freezing outside, we could all die, but I know if I open my mouth I might die right here on the kitchen floor.
We're out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap. She opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on Finn the Horse. She orders us to scrub each other's backs and don't stop till she tells us. Michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesn't care. She keeps telling us we're still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us we'll rue the day. Another rue. I scrub myself harder. We all scrub till we're pink and our jaws chatter. It's not enough for Aunt Aggie. She comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us. Now, she says, get inside and dry yeerselves. We stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel. We stand and shiver and wait because you can't go marching into her kitchen till she tells you. We hear her inside starting the fire, rattling the poker in the range, then yelling at us, Are ye goin' to stand in there all day? Come in here and put on yeer clothes.
She gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because you're not supposed to say a word unless she tells you. Michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles, 'Tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up, and gives each of us another cut. She tries to feed Alphie bread soaked in tea but he won't eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when he's finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and we're delighted. She runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and we're able to grin at each other at the table and tell Alphie he's the champion baby in the world. Uncle Pa Keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works. Oh, bejay, he says, what's this?
Michael says, My mother is in the hospital, Uncle Pa. Is that so? What's up with her?
Pneumonia, says Malachy.
Well, now, that's better than oldmonia.
We don't know what he's laughing at and Aunt Aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how Mam is in the hospital and we're to stay with them till she gets out. He says, Grand, grand, and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back you'd never know he touched himself with water at all he's that black.
He sits at the table and Aunt Aggie gives him his supper, which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes. She tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato. He says, Arrah, for Jaysus sake, Aggie, the children are hungry, and she says, 'Tis none of your business. They're not yours. She tells us go out and play and be home for bed by half-past eight. We know it's freezing outside and we'd like to stay in by that warm range but it's easier to be in the streets playing than inside with Aunt Aggie and her nagging.
She calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died. The woman says tell your
aunt I'd like that rubber sheet back for the next child. Aunt Aggie says, Twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet. Forty-five she is now and if there's another child we'll have to look for a star in the East. Malachy says, What's that? and she tells him mind his own business, he's too young.
Aunt Aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts Alphie on it between herself and Uncle Pa. She sleeps inside against the wall and Uncle Pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work. We are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over. She says if she hears a word out of us during the night she'll warm our arses and we're to be up early in the morning because it's Ash Wednesday and it wouldn't do us any harm to go to Mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia.
The alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep. Aunt Aggie calls from her bed, The three of ye are to get up and go to Mass. Do ye hear me? Up. Wash yeer faces and go to the Jesuits.
Her backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water. We throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel that's still damp from yesterday. Malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise, that's what Mam would say.
The streets are frosty and icy, too, but the Jesuit church is warm. It must be grand to be a Jesuit, sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say Mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your Latin office before you go to sleep. I'd like to be a Jesuit some day but there's no hope of that when you grow up in a lane. Jesuits are very particular. They don't like poor people. They like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups.
The church is crowded with people at seven o'clock Mass getting the ashes on their foreheads. Malachy whispers that Michael shouldn't get the ashes because he won't be making his First Communion till May and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the ashes. An old woman behind us says, What are ye doin' to that lovely child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he's not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won't admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I'm starting to forget it. The old woman says you don't have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he's a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes.
Aunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie's bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there's paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won't start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen. She shoves me away from the range. Jesus above, can't you do anything right? You're supposed to open the damper, you eejit.
I don't know anything about dampers. In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt's house and you're supposed to know all about dampers. There's no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She'll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It's hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I'm a man I won't go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there. Would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke? Of course you wouldn't. You have a puss on you like your father from the North. Do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down?
She cuts three slices from a loaf, smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed. We have the tea and bread and it's one morning we're glad to go to school where it's warm and there are no yelling aunts.
After school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about Mam in the hospital and how we're all at Aunt Aggie's till Mam comes home. I'm to tell him we're all happy and in the best of health, send money, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha, Alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies.
I don't know why she's always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. He drinks his pints at South's pub but never comes home singing songs of Ireland's long woeful history. He says, A pox on all their houses, and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that. The minute a politician or a Pope starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other. The human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it's been up to.
There are good times with Uncle Pa when Aunt Aggie goes to the Mechanics' Institute to play cards, forty-five. He says, To hell with the begrudgers. He gets himself two bottles of stout from South's, six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner. He makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it, eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over Uncle Pa and the way he goes on about the world. He says, I swallowed the gas, I drink the pint, I don't give a fiddler's fart about the world and its cousin. If little Alphie gets tired and cranky and cries Uncle Pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him, Here, have a suck of diddy momma. The sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks Alphie and makes him good again.
Before Aunt Aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she won't know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches. She'd nag Uncle Pa for a month if she ever found out and that's what I don't understand. Why does he let her nag him like that? He went to the Great War, he was gassed, he's big, he has a job, he makes the world laugh. It's a mystery. That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told.
I could easily have Uncle Pa for a father. We'd have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says, Light a match. That's a present from the Germans.
Aunt Aggie torments me all the time. She calls me scabby eyes. She says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an altar to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.
I want to get away from her and I can think of only one way, to make myself sick and go to the hospital. I get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard. I can pretend I'm going to the lavatory. I stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope I'll catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that I'll go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress. I might meet another Patricia Madigan and learn a long poem. I stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping I'll wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks. But I don't. I feel fresh and lively and I'd be in great form if I could be at home with my mother and brothers.
There are days when Aunt Aggie tells us she can't stand the sight of us another minute, Get away from me. Here, scabby eyes, take Alphie out in his pram, take your brothers, go to the park and play, do anything ye like and don't come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It's cold but we don't care. We push the pram up O'Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra or the Rosbrien Road. We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie's mouth till he's full and throws it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in me arms. Then he has a great notion, Why can't we go to our own house and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to Roden Lane. There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptorist church and we know we're in trouble with Aunt Aggie for being late.
We don't care. She can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in Italy.
You can tell she never has grand times like that. Electric light and a lavatory but no grand times.
Grandma comes for her on Thursdays and Sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see Mam. We can't go because children are not allowed and if we say, How's Mam? they look cranky and tell us she's all right, she'll live. We'd like to know when she's getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but we're afraid to open our mouths.
Malachy tells Aunt Aggie one day he's hungry and could he have a piece of bread. She hits him with a rolled up Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart and there are tears on his eyelashes. He doesn't come home from school the next day and he's still gone at bedtime. Aunt Aggie says, Well, I suppose he ran away. Good riddance. If he was hungry he'd be here. Let him find comfort in a ditch.
Next day Michael runs in from the street, Dad's here, Dad's here, and runs back out and there's Dad sitting on the hall floor hugging Michael, crying, Your poor mother, your poor mother, and there's a smell of drink on him. Aunt Aggie is smiling, Oh, you're here, and she makes tea and eggs and sausages. She sends me out for a bottle of stout for Dad and I wonder why she's so pleasant and generous all of a sudden. Michael says, Are we going to our own house, Dad?
We are, son.
Alphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire. Aunt Aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys, come back for tea anytime, and there's a bad word for her in my head, Oul' bitch. It's in my head and I can't help it and I'll have to tell the priest in confession.
Malachy isn't in a ditch, he's there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the Sarsfield Barracks.
Mam comes home in two days. She's weak and white and walks slowly. She says, The doctor told me keep warm, have plenty of rest and nourishing food, meat and eggs three times a week. God help us, those poor doctors don't have a notion of not having. Dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire. He fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in Italy where it's warm. He says he can't stay forever, he has to go back to work in Coventry. Mam wonders how he'll get to Coventry without a penny in his pocket. He's up early on Holy Saturday and I have tea with him by the fire. He fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the Limerick Chronicle, two cuts in each coat pocket. Mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs, I'm going now. She says, All right. Write when you land. My father is going to England and she won't even get out of the bed. I ask if I can go with him to the railway station. No, he's not going there. He's going to the Dublin road to see if he can get a lift. He pats my head, tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door. I watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner. I run up the lane to see him go down Barrack Hill and down St. Joseph's Street. I run down the hill and follow him as far as I can. He must know I'm following him because he turns and calls to me, Go home, Francis. Go home to your mother.
In a week there's a letter to say he arrived safely, that we are to be good boys, attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother. In another week there's a telegram money order for three pounds and we're in heaven. We'll be rich, there will be fish and chips, jelly and custard, films every Saturday at the Lyric, the Coliseum, the Carlton, the Atheneum, the Central and the fanciest of all, the Savoy. We might even wind up having tea and cakes at the Savoy Café with the nobs and toffs of Limerick. We'll be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out.
The next Saturday there's no telegram nor the Saturday after nor any Saturday forever. Mam begs again at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and smiles at the Dispensary when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane have their bit of a joke about Dad having a tart in Piccadilly. Michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him it's something you have with tea. She spends most of the day by the fire with Bridey Hannon puffing on her Woodlbines, drinking weak tea. The bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school. She never washes the
jam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness.
She says Malachy and I have to take turns looking after Alphie, taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air. The child can't be kept in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears.
We play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack Hill and Malachy is at the bottom. When I give the pram a push down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he's looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of Leniston's pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying Goo goo goo goo. The barman shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he'll call the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, 'tis a hard world, the minute you think you're getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and you're dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother.
Malachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade, but I don't want Mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross. Malachy says I'm not a sport and runs off. I push the pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It's a gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests' house is gray. They're waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests' dinner.
There in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother.
This is my own mother, begging. This is worse than the dole, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Dispensary. It's the worst kind of shame, almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children, Give us a penny for the poor child, mister, the poor child is hungry, missus.
My mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely. My pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and I know what they'll say, Frankie McCourt beggar woman's boy scabby-eyed dancing blubber-gob Jap.
The door of the priests' house swings open and the people rush with their hands out. I can hear them, Brother, brother, here, brother, ah, for the love o' God, brother. Five children at home, brother. I can see my own mother pushed along. I can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and I push the pram up the street before she can see me.
I don't want to go home anymore. I push the pram down to the Dock Road, out to Corkanree where all the dust and garbage of Limerick is dumped and burned. I stand a while and look at boys chase rats. I don't know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses. I'd keep going on into the country forever if I didn't have Alphie bawling with the hunger, kicking his chubby legs, waving his empty bottle.
Mam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot. Malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from
Kathleen O'Connell's shop. He wouldn't be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar. She calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table it's hard for me to look at my mother the beggar. She lifts the pot to the table, spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef.
It isn't corned beef at all. It's a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top. We stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it. Mam says, That's for Alphie. He's a baby, he's growing fast, he needs it. She puts it on a saucer in front of him. He pushes it away with his finger, then pulls it back. He lifts it to his mouth, looks around the kitchen, sees Lucky the dog and throws it to him.
There's no use saying anything. The meat is gone. We eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and I eat my fat and pretend it's that nipple of red meat.
XI
Mam warns us, Ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for there's nothing in there that's of the slightest interest or any of yeer business.
All she has in that trunk is a lot of papers, certificates of birth and baptism, her Irish passport, Dad's English passport from Belfast, our American passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from America. She wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing.
I don't care what she has in the trunk till I start a football team with Billy Campbell and Malachy. We can't afford uniforms or boots and Billy says, How will the world know who we are? We don't even have a name.
I remember the red dress and a name comes to me, The Red Hearts of Limerick. Mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if I cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests? What you don't know won't bother you, she always says herself.
The dress is buried under the papers. I look at my passport picture when I was small and I can see why they call me Jap. There's a paper that says Marriage Certificate, that Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan were joined in Holy Matrimony on the twenty-eighth of March, 1930. How could that be? I was born on the nineteenth of August and Billy Campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before there's a sign of a child. Here I am born into the world in half the time. That means I must be a miracle and I might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of St. Francis of Limerick.
I'll have to ask Mikey Molloy, still the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.
Billy says if we're to be great soccer players we have to practice and we're to meet over in the park. The boys complain when I hand out the hearts and I tell them if they don't like it they can go home and cut up their own mother's dresses and blouses.
We have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheep's bladder stuffed with rags. We kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up
kicking a bladder that's hardly there anymore. Billy says we're to meet tomorrow morning which is Saturday and go out Ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich Crescent College boys to a proper game, seven a side. He says we're to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if they're red rags.
Malachy is going home for tea but I can't go because I have to see Mikey Molloy and find out why I was born in half the time. Mikey is coming out of his house with his father, Peter. It's Mikey's sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to Bowles's pub for his first pint. Nora Molloy is inside screeching after Peter that if they go they can stay gone, she's done baking bread, she's never going to the lunatic asylum again, if he brings that child home drunk she'll go to Scotland and disappear from the face of the earth.
Peter tells Mikey, Pay no attention to her, Cyclops. The mothers of Ireland are always enemies of the first pint. My own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint.
Mikey asks Peter if I can come with them and have a lemonade.
Peter tells everyone in the pub that Mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand Mikey a pint Peter says, Ah, no, 'twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely.
The pints are drawn and we sit against the wall, the Molloys with their pints and I with my lemonade. The men wish Mikey all the best in the life to come and wasn't it a gift from God that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasn't it a great pity about that poor little bugger, Quasimodo Dooley, carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an Englishman so he could be on the BBC which is no fit place for an Irishman anyway.
Peter is talking to the men and Mikey, sipping his first pint, whispers to me, I don't think I like it, but don't tell my father. Then he tells me how he practices the English accent in secret so that he can be a BBC announcer, Quasimodo's dream. He tells me I can have Cuchulain back, that he's no use to you when you're reading the news on the BBC. Now that he's sixteen he wants to go to England and if ever I get a wireless that will be him on the BBC Home Service.
I tell him about the marriage certificate, how Billy Campbell said it has to be nine months but I was born in half the time and would he know if I was some class of a miracle.
Naw, he says, naw. You're a bastard. You're doomed.
You don't have to be cursing me, Mikey.
I'm not. That's what they call people who aren't born inside the
nine months of the marriage, people conceived beyond the blanket. What's that?
What's what?
Conceived.
That's when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are
nine months later.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He whispers, The thing between your legs is the excitement. I don't
like the other names, the dong, the prick, the dick, the langer. So your father shoves his excitement into your mother and there's a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where there's an egg and that grows into you.
I'm not an egg.
You are an egg. Everyone was an egg once.
Why am I doomed? 'Tisn't my fault I'm a bastard.
All bastards are doomed. They're like babies that weren't baptized.
They're sent to Limbo for eternity and there's no way out and it's not their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That's why I don't go near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you're doomed. Your father and mother had the excitement and they weren't married so you're not in a state of grace.
What am I going to do?
Nothing. You're doomed.
Can't I light a candle or something.
You could try the Blessed Virgin. She's in charge of the doom.
But I don't have a penny for the candle.
All right, all right, here's a penny. You can give it back when you
get a job a million years from now. 'Tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.
The barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter, What's the opposite of advance?
Retreat, says Peter.
That's it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God, says Peter.
What's up with you, Peter? says the barman.
What was that you said before, Tommy?
Everything has an opposite.
Mother o' God.
Are you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right?
The pint is grand, Tommy, and I'm the champion of all pint
drinkers, amn't I?
Begod an' you are, Peter. No denyin' that to you.
That means I could be the champion in the opposite department. What are you talking about, Peter?
I could be the champion of no pints at all.
Ah, now, Peter, I think you're going a bit far. Is the wife all
right at home?
Tommy, take this pint away from me. I'm the champion of no pints at
all.
Peter turns and takes the glass from Mikey. We're going home to
your mother, Mikey.
You didn't call me Cyclops, Dad.
You're Mikey. You're Michael. We're going to England. No more pints
for me, no pints for you, no more bread baking for your mother. Come on. We're leaving the pub and Tommy the barman calls after us, You know
what 'tis, Peter. 'Tis all them bloody books you're reading. They have your head destroyed.
Peter and Mikey turn to go home. I have to go to St. Joseph's to light the candle that will save me from the doom but I look in the window of Counihan's shop and there in the middle is a great slab of Cleeves' toffee and a sign, TWO PIECES FOR A PENNY. I know I'm doomed but the water is running along the sides of my tongue and when I put my penny on the counter for Miss Counihan I promise the Virgin Mary the next penny I get I'll be lighting a candle and would she please talk to her Son and delay the doom for awhile.
A penn'orth of Cleeves' toffee doesn't last forever and when it's gone I have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his
excitement into her so that I could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard. If she ever says a word about the red dress or anything I'll tell her I know all about the excitement and she'll be shocked.
Saturday morning I meet The Red Hearts of Limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge. The boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress don't look like hearts till Billy tells them if they don't want to play football go home and play with their sisters' dolls.
There are boys playing football in a field in Ballinacurra and Billy challenges them. They have eight players and we have only seven but we don't mind because one of them has one eye and Billy tells us stay on his blind side. Besides, he says, Frankie McCourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and that's worse. They're all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots. One of them says we look like something the cat brought in and Malachy has to be held back from fighting them. We agree to play half an hour because the Ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch. Lunch. The whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch. If no one scores in half an hour it's a draw. We play back and forth till Billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal. The half hour is nearly up but the Ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour. Then the ball goes over the line for touch. It's our ball. Billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head. He pretends to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as if it's the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal. There's a whiteness in my head and I feel like a boy in heaven. I'm floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, you too, Billy.
We walk back along O'Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I'll never forget that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal.
Mam meets Bridey Hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about Mr. Hannon's poor legs. Poor John, it's a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the Dock Road. He's paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He's up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won't get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can't afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they're gray.
Mam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That's all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn't work?
Mam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and Bridey is offended. Don't you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don't you know I had rheumatic fever an' I could go at any time? I have to be careful.
Mam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesn't stop her from puffing away on the Woodbines.
Mam tells Bridey she's very sorry over the weak chest and it's terrible the way her father suffers. Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John is getting worse every day, And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt, if your boy Frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs.
Mam says, I don't know, he's only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldn't be good for his eyes.
Bridey says, He'd be out in the air and there's nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn't that right, Frankie?
'Tis, Bridey.
I'm dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a real workingman. If I'm good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn't interfere with school and he can start on a Saturday morning.
I'm a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to come out with his bicycle and there's a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him. They're like two lovers out of an American film the way they go on. Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely. There's a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze.
Men are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank's Flour Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We'll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve.
First we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water. Mr. Hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it.
That makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life.
There are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale, a hundredweight in each bag. It's their job to stack the bags on the float while Mr. Hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets. The bag men are fast and we're ready for our rounds. Mr. Hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where I'm to sit on the right side. It's hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and I try to get up by climbing the wheel. Mr. Hannon says I should never do the likes of that again. Never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in
the shafts. A horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it. He says to the horse, G'up ower that, and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and Mr. Hannon laughs. That fool of a horse loves to work, he says. He won't be rattling his harness in a few hours.
When the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and Mr. Hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry. He says the rain makes everything heavier but what's the use of complaining. You might as well complain about the sun in Africa.
We cross the Sarsfield Bridge for deliveries to the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road. Rich people, says Mr. Hannon, and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip.
We have sixteen bags to deliver. Mr. Hannon says we're lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesn't have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs. When we stop he gets down and I pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders. Some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and that's easy. There are other houses with long backyards and you can see Mr. Hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors. Ah, Jaysus, Frankie, ah, Jaysus, is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float. He says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks' wages and who could afford that?
The bags are delivered and the sun is out, the float is empty, and the horse knows his workday is over. It's lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the Ennis Road over the Shannon and up the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade. He tells me I should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him. Go to school, Frankie, and get out of Limerick and Ireland itself. This war will be over some day and you can go to America or Australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land. The world is wide and you can have great adventures. If I didn't have these two legs I'd be over in England making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the Irishmen, like your father. No, not like your father. I hear he left you high and dry, eh? I don't know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter. School, Frankie, school. The books, the books, the books. Get out of Limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely.
The horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown. Mr. Hannon talks to him all the time and calls him Me oul' segosha, and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against Mr. Hannon's chest. I'd love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when we're up in Italy but even if I could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse.
The streets going up from the Dock Road are too hilly for Mr. Hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me, so we walk. His legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to Henry Street. He leans
on the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses, grinding down on the pipe in his mouth.
I'm wondering when I'll get the money for the day's work because Mam might let me go to the Lyric Cinema if I get home in time with my shilling or whatever Mr. Hannon gives me. Now we're at the door of South's pub and he tells me come in, didn't he promise me a lemonade?
Uncle Pa Keating is sitting in the pub. He's all black as usual and he's sitting next to Bill Galvin, all white as usual, snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint. Mr. Hannon says, How're you? and sits on the other side of Bill Galvin and everyone in the pub laughs. Jaysus, says the barman, look at that, two lumps of coal and a snowball. Men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the Limerick Leader for a man with a camera.
Uncle Pa says, What are you doing all black yourself, Frankie? Did you fall down a coal mine?
I was helping Mr. Hannon on the float.
Your eyes look atrocious, Frankie. Piss holes in the snow. 'Tis the coal dust, Uncle Pa.
Wash them when you go home.
I will, Uncle Pa.
Mr. Hannon buys me a lemonade, gives me the shilling for my
morning's work and tells me I can go home now, I'm a great worker and I can help him again next week after school.
On the way home I see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man. I'm not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy's School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn't have to be a beggar at the Redemptorist priests' house.
People on the streets and lanes give me curious looks. Boys and girls laugh and call out, Here's the chimney sweep. How much do you want for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you burned by the darkness?
They're ignorant. They don't know I spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf. They don't know I'm a man.
Mam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there's a coat over the window to keep the room dark. I tell her I earned a shilling and she says I can go to the Lyric, I deserve it. Take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea. The coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright. Mam looks at me, God above, look at your eyes. Go downstairs and I'll be down in a minute to wash them.
She heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me I can't go to the Lyric Cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though God knows when that will be. She says, You can't be delivering coal with the state of your eyes. The dust will surely destroy them.
I want the job. I want to bring home the shilling. I want to be a man.
You can be a man without bringing home a shilling. Go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or it's a blind man you'll be.
I want that job. I wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder. I remember Seamus in the hospital and how his uncle's eyes were cured with the blink exercise and I make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day. You can't beat the blink for the strong eye, he said. And now I blink and blink till Malachy runs to my mother, talking out in the lane with Mrs. Hannon, Mam, something is up with Frankie, he's upstairs blinking and blinking.
She comes running up. What's wrong with you? I'm making my eyes strong with the exercise. What exercise?
The blinking.
Blinking is not exercise.
Seamus in the hospital says you can't beat the blink for the strong eye. His uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking. She says I'm getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with Mrs. Hannon and I blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water. I can hear Mrs. Hannon through the window, Your little Frankie is a godsend to John for 'tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely.
Mam doesn't say anything and that means she feels so sorry for Mr. Hannon she'll let me help him again on his heavy delivery day, Thursday. I wash my eyes three times a day and I blink till I get a pain in my eyebrows. I blink in school when the master isn't looking and all the boys in my class are calling me Blinky and adding that to the list of names.
Blinky McCourt beggar woman's son scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing
Jap.
I don't care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are
clearing up and I have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float. I wish they could see me on Thursday after school when I'm on the float and Mr. Hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort. Here you are, Frankie, nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesn't need to be pulled at.
He hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse. It's all for show and I just flick it at the air like Mr. Hannon or I might knock a fly off the horse's great golden rump swinging between the shafts.
Surely the world is looking at me and admiring the way I rock with the float, the cool way I have with the reins and the whip. I wish I had a pipe like Mr. Hannon and a tweed cap. I wish I could be a real coal man with black skin like Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa Keating so that people would say, There goes Frankie McCourt that delivers all the coal in Limerick and drinks his pint in South's pub. I'd never wash my face. I'd be black every day of the year even Christmas when you're supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the Infant Jesus. I know He wouldn't mind because I saw the Three Wise Men in the Christmas crib at the Redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than Uncle Pa Keating, the blackest man in Limerick, and if a Wise Man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal.
The horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind. I start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but Mr. Hannon says, No, Frankie, let him trot. They always shit on the trot. That's one of the blessings horses have, they shit on the trot, and they're not dirty and stinking
like the human race, not at all, Frankie. The worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pig's feet and a night of pints. The stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man. Horses are different. All they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural.
I work with Mr. Hannon after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the half day on Saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes. The minute I get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour.
Mr. Hannon says he'll wait near Leamy's School for me on Thursdays after his deliveries on Barrington Street. Now the boys will see me. Now they'll know I'm a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr. Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort I'll take the reins and when he hands them over I'm sure I hear the boys gasping. I tell the horse, G'up ower that, like Mr. Hannon. We trot away and I know dozens of Leamy's boys are committing the deadly sin of envy. I tell the horse again, G'up ower that, to make sure everyone heard, to make sure they know I'm driving that float and no one else, to make sure they'll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip. It's the best day of my life, better than my First Communion day, which Grandma ruined, better than my Confirmation day when I had the typhoid.
They don't call me names anymore. They don't laugh at my scabby eyes. They want to know how I got such a good job at eleven years of age and what I'm paid and if I'll have that job forever. They want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would I put in a good word for them.
Then there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because they're bigger and I'm nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders. They can talk as much as they like. I have the job and Mr. Hannon tells me I'm powerful.
There are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see Mrs. Hannon worries. She gives me a mug of tea and I watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages. The sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust. She washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment. She props the legs up on a chair and that's where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head.
The legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It's still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I'd go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I'd just roll them on the handcart for him. He won't be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart.
The neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him.
I wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He's so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You're a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them
on to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon.
I wish the boys at Leamy's could see me now, the way I drive the horse and handle the bags, the way I do everything while Mr. Hannon rests his legs. I wish they could see me pushing the handcart to South's pub and having my lemonade with Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa and me all black and Bill Galvin all white. I'd like to show the world the tips Mr. Hannon lets me keep, four shillings, and the shilling he gives me for the morning's work, five shillings altogether.
Mam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I'm puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass and look at your eyes.
My face is black and the eyes are worse than ever. The whites and the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away.
Mam says that's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon. I try to explain that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is the best, Rommel or Montgomery.
She says she's sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, now you want to go blind on top of it.
And I can't stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father. I can't stop crying because I don't know what Mr. Hannon is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. I can't stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because he's so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon isn't there to take him out, if I'm not there to take him out? Will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple?
Mam says I shouldn't be crying, it's bad for the eyes. She says, We'll see. That's all I can tell you now. We'll see.
She washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malachy to the Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have two pieces of Cleeves' toffee. It's hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what's happening. People around us tell him shut up, they'd like to hear what Boris Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them he's only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he'll throw the two of us out.
I don't mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is yellow.
Monday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that Mr. Hannon can't come in today, that he has to see a doctor
about his legs, that he'll surely be in tomorrow and what he can't deliver today he will tomorrow. Mrs. Hannon always calls me Frank now. Anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a Frankie.
The man in the office says, Humph. I think we're very tolerant with Hannon. You, what's your name?
McCourt, sir.
Tell Hannon we'll need a note from the doctor. Do you understand
that?
I do, sir.
The doctor tells Mr. Hannon he has to go to the hospital or it's a case of gangrene he'll have and the doctor won't be responsible. The ambulance takes Mr. Hannon away and my big job is gone. Now I'll be white like everyone else in Leamy's, no float, no horse, no shillings to bring home to my mother.
In a few days Bridey Hannon comes to our door. She says her mother would like me to come and see her, have a cup of tea with her. Mrs. Hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of Mr. Hannon's chair. Sit down, Frank, she says, and when I go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says, No, sit here. Sit here on the chair of himself. Do you know how old he is, Frank?
Oh, he must be very old, Mrs. Hannon. He must be thirty-five.
She smiles. She has lovely teeth. He's forty-nine, Frank, and a man that age shouldn't have legs like that.
He shouldn't, Mrs. Hannon.
Did you know you were a joy to him going around on that float?
I didn't, Mrs. Hannon.
You were. We had two daughters, Bridey that you know, and Kathleen,
the nurse above in Dublin. But no son and he said you gave him the feeling of a son.
I feel my eyes burning and I don't want her to see me crying especially when I don't know why I'm crying. That's all I do lately. Is it the job? Is it Mr. Hannon? My mother says, Oh, your bladder is near your eye.
I think I'm crying because of the quiet way Mrs. Hannon is talking and she's talking like that because of Mr. Hannon.
Like a son, she says, and I'm glad he had that feeling. His working days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out. There might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesn't have to be lifting and hauling.
I won't have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon.
You have a job, Frank. School. That's your job.
That's not a job, Mrs. Hannon.
You'll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr.
Hannon's heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mother's heart and 'twill destroy your eyes. God knows I'm sorry I ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and Mr. Hannon's legs.
Can I go to the hospital to see Mr. Hannon?
They might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. God knows he won't be doing much but reading and looking out the window.
Mam tells me at home, You shouldn't cry but then again tears are salty and they'll wash the bad stuff from your eyes.
XII
There's a letter from Dad. He's coming home two days before Christmas. He says everything will be different, he's a new man, he hopes we're good boys, obeying our mother, attending to our religious duties, and he's bringing us all something for Christmas.
Mam takes me to the railway station to meet him. The station is always exciting with all the coming and going, people leaning from carriages, crying, smiling, waving good-bye, the train hooting and calling, chugging away in clouds of steam, people sniffling on the platform, the railway tracks silvering into the distance, on to Dublin and the world beyond.
Now it's near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we'd like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she's heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God.
We're above the world and it's dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board. He says, I'm just having a bit of supper and you're welcome.
Mam says, Ah, no, thanks, we couldn't take your supper from you.
He says, The wife always makes too much for me and if I was up in this tower for a week I wouldn't be able to eat it. Sure it's not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever.
He takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug. Here, he says to me, put yourself outside that cocoa.
He hands Mam half a sandwich. Ah, no, she says, surely you could take that home to your children.
I have two sons, missus, and they're off there fighting in the forces of His Majesty, the King of England. One did his bit with Montgomery in Africa and the other is over in Burma or some other bloody place, excuse the language. We get our freedom from England and then we fight her wars. So here, missus, take the bit of sandwich.
Lights on the board are clicking and the man says, Your train is coming, missus.
Thank you very much and Happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas to yourself, missus, and a Happy New Year, too. Mind yourself on that ladder, young fella. Help your mother.
Thank you very much, sir.
We wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station. Carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate. There is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform. A man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines.
There is no sign of my father. Mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed. She says the boat from Holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train. The Irish Sea is desperate at this time of the year.
He's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England.
Don't talk about your father like that.
I say no more to her. I don't tell her I wish I had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa.
Next day Dad walks in the door. His top teeth are missing and there's a bruise under his left eye. He says the Irish Sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out. Mam says, It wouldn't be the drink, would it? It wouldn't be a fight?
Och, no, Angela.
Michael says, You said you'd have something for us, Dad.
Oh, I do.
He takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to Mam.
She opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are
gone.
Could you spare it? she says.
She shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece. We'll have
chocolates after our Christmas dinner tomorrow.
Mam asks him if he brought any money. He tells her times are hard,
jobs are scarce, and she says, Is it coddin' me you are? There's a war on and there's nothing but jobs in England. You drank the money, didn't you?
You drank the money, Dad.
You drank the money, Dad.
You drank the money, Dad.
We're shouting so loud Alphie begins to cry. Dad says, Och, boys,
now boys. Respect for your father.
He puts on his cap. He has to see a man. Mam says, Go see your man
but don't come drunk to this house tonight singing Roddy McCorley or anything else.
He comes home drunk but he's quiet and passes out on the floor next to Mam's bed.
We have a Christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher Mam got from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We have sheep's head, cabbage, floury white potatoes, and a bottle of cider because it's Christmas.
Dad says he's not hungry, he'll have tea, borrows a cigarette from Mam. She says, Eat something. It's Christmas.
He tells her again he's not hungry but if no one else wants them he'll eat the sheep's eyes. He says there's great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust. He washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his Woodbine. He puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase.
Mam says, Where are you going?
London.
On this day of Our Lord? Christmas Day?
It's the best day for travel. People in motor cars will always give
the workingman a lift to Dublin. They think of the hard times of the Holy Family.
And how will you get on the boat to Holyhead without a penny in your pocket?
The way I came. There's always a time when they're not looking.
He kisses each of us on the forehead, tells us be good boys, obey Mam, say our prayers. He tells Mam he'll write and she says, Oh, yes, the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it's too hard and she can't chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which will last longer. It's creamy and rich and there's a nut in the middle. Malachy and Michael complain they didn't get a nut and why is it
Frank always gets the nut? Mam says, What do you mean, always? This is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates.
Malachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn't he give us the nut?
Mam says, Because 'tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes.
Michael says, Will the nut make his eyes better?
'Twill.
Will it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better?
The two eyes, I think.
Malachy says, If I had another nut I'd give it to him for his eyes. Mam says, I know you would.
Dad watches us a moment eating our chocolates. He lifts the latch,
goes out the door and pulls it shut.
Mam tells Bridey Hannon, Days are bad but nights are worse and will
this rain ever stop? She tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting Malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing Alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea that's in it. We have to go downstairs to Ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair. She makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did it's back down to the tap and the damp shirt. When there's a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find. We wear short pants till we're thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability that's in it. It's a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings. When we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope they'll dry by morning. Then they're hard with dirt cake and we're afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they'll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes. We might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I fight with my brother, Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless Mam threatens us from the bed that we're to help our small brother. She says, If ye don't fix yeer brother's shoes an' I have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green. You'd have to feel sorry for Michael because he's too old to play with Alphie and too young to play with us and he can't fight with anyone for the same reasons.
The rest of the dressing is easy, the shirt I wore to bed is the shirt I wear to school. I wear it day in day out. It's the shirt for football, for climbing walls, for robbings orchards. I go to Mass and the Confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away. If Mam gets a docket for a new one at the St. Vincent de Paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or Mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts. She might even cut it up and let Alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane.
We go to school through lanes and back streets so that we won't meet the respectable boys who go to the Christian Brothers'School or the rich ones who go to the Jesuit school, Crescent College. The Christian Brothers' boys wear tweed jackets, warm woolen sweaters, shirts, ties and shiny new boots. We know they're the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world. The Crescent College boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show they're cock o' the walk. They have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like Englishmen. We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world. We'll be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or we'll go to England to work on the building sites. Our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to England, too. We know that. We're ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks we'll get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes. Our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and, Ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye don't.
You never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it's a bad night she'll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have.
Michael is just as bad. He brings home stray dogs and old men. You never know when you'll find a dog in the bed with him. There are dogs with sores, dogs with no ears, no tails. There's a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children. Michael fought off the children, picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told Mam the dog could have his supper. Mam says, What supper? We're lucky if there's a cut of bread in the house. Michael tells her the dog can have his bread. Mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and Michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him. He won't go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary. Malachy says it's useless saying prayers for a dog, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of course he was a Catholic dog. Didn't I have him in my arms? He cries so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school. We're so delighted we don't mind helping Michael with the grave and we say three Hail Marys. We're not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea. Mam says it's driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn't have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors' doors and has no shame begging for it. In the end she tells
Michael, No more old men. One of them left us with lice and we're plagued.
The lice are disgusting, worse than rats. They're in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones. They dig into our skin. They get into the seams of our clothes and they're everywhere in the coats we use as blankets. We have to search every inch of Alphie's body because he's a baby and helpless.
The lice are worse than the fleas. Lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins. Fleas jump and bite and they're clean and we prefer them. Things that jump are cleaner than things that squat.
We all agree there will be no more stray women and children, dogs and old men. We don't want any more diseases and infections.
Michael cries.
Grandma's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Purcell, has the only wireless in her lane. The government gave it to her because she's old and blind. I want a radio. My grandmother is old but she's not blind and what's the use of having a grandmother who won't go blind and get a government radio?
Sunday nights I sit outside on the pavement under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to plays on the BBC and Radio Eireann, the Irish station. You can hear plays by O'Casey, Shaw, Ibsen and Shakespeare himself, the best of all, even if he is English. Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes, you can never get enough of him. And you can hear strange plays about Greeks plucking out their eyes because they married their mothers by mistake.
One night I'm sitting under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to Macbeth. Her daughter, Kathleen, sticks her head out the door. Come in, Frankie. My mother says you'll catch the consumption sitting on the ground in this weather.
Ah, no, Kathleen. It's all right.
No. Come in.
They give me tea and a grand cut of bread slathered with blackberry
jam. Mrs. Purcell says, Do you like the Shakespeare, Frankie?
I love the Shakespeare, Mrs. Purcell.
Oh, he's music, Frankie, and he has the best stories in the world.
I don't know what I'd do with meself of a Sunday night if I didn't have the Shakespeare.
When the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in cafés, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news.
Mrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we'll know the state of the world.
After the news there is the American Armed Forces Network and it's lovely to hear the American voices easy and cool and here is the music,
oh, man, the music of Duke Ellington himself telling me take the A train to where Billie Holiday sings only to me, I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.
Oh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives happily ever after.
And Mrs. Purcell says, Do you know what, Frankie?
What, Mrs. Purcell?
That Shakespeare is that good he must have been an Irishman. The rent man is losing his patience. He tells Mam, Four weeks
behind you are, missus. That's one pound two shillings. This has to stop for I have to go back to the office and report to Sir Vincent Nash that the McCourts are a month behind. Where am I then, missus? Out on my arse jobless and a mother to support that's ninety-two and a daily communicant in the Franciscan church. The rent man collects the rents, missus, or he loses the job. I'll be back next week and if you don't have the money, one pound eight shillings and sixpence total, 'tis out on the pavement you'll be with the skies dripping on your furniture.
Mam comes back up to Italy and sits by the fire wondering where in God's name she'll get the money for a week's rent never mind the arrears. She'd love a cup of tea but there's no way of boiling the water till Malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms. Mam says, Well, 'tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire. We boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after? Mam says, One more board from that wall, one more and not another one. She says that for two weeks till there's nothing left but the beam frame. She warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself.
Oh, we'd never touch the beams.
She goes to see Grandma and it's so cold in the house I take the hatchet to one of the beams. Malachy cheers me on and Michael claps his hands with excitement. I pull on the beam, the ceiling groans and down on Mam's bed there's a shower of plaster, slates, rain. Malachy says, Oh, God, we'll all be killed, and Michael dances around singing, Frankie broke the house, Frankie broke the house.
We run through the rain to tell Mam the news. She looks puzzled with Michael chanting, Frankie broke the house, till I explain there's a hole in the house and it's falling down. She says, Jesus, and runs through the streets with Grandma trying to keep up.
Mam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair, What'll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with the beams. Grandma says, I'll go to the landlord's office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely.
She's back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in heaven, where's the other room?
Grandma says, What room?
I rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone. Where is that room? Mam says, What room?
There were two rooms up here and now there's one. And what happened
to the wall? There was a wall. Now there's no wall. I distinctly remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is that wall? Where is that room?
Grandma says, I don't remember a wall and if I don't remember a wall how can I remember a room?
Ye don't remember? Well, I remember. Forty years a landlord's agent and I never seen the likes of this. By God, 'tis a desperate situation altogether when you can't turn your back but tenants are not paying their rent and making walls and rooms disappear on top of it. I want to know where that wall is and what ye did with the room, so I do.
Mam turns to us. Do any of ye remember a wall?
Michael pulls at her hand. Is that the wall we burned in the fire? The rent man says, Dear God in heaven, this beats Banagher, this
takes the bloody biscuit, this is goin' beyond the beyonds. No rent and what am I to tell Sir Vincent below in the office? Out, missus, I'm puttin' ye out. One week from today I'll knock on this door and I want to find nobody at home, everybody out never to return. Do you have me, missus?
Mam's face is tight. 'Tis a pity you weren't alive in the times when the English were evicting us and leaving us on the side of the road.
No lip, missus, or I'll send the men to put ye out tomorrow.
He goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us. Mam says, I don't know in God's name what I'm going to do. Grandma says, Well, I don't have room for ye but your cousin, Gerard Griffin, is living out the Rosbrien Road in that little house of his mother's and he'd surely be able to take ye in till better times come. 'Tis all hours of the night but I'll go up and see what he says and Frank can come with me.
She tells me put on a coat but I don't have one and she says, I suppose there's no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either. Come on.
She pulls the shawl over her head and I follow her out the door, up the lane, through the rain to Rosbrien Road nearly two miles away. She knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages. Are you there, Laman? I know you're in there. Open the door.
Grandma, why are you calling him Laman? Isn't his name Gerard?
How would I know? Do I know why the world calls your uncle Pat Ab? Everyone calls this fella Laman. Open the door. We'll go in. He might be working overtime.
She pushes the door. It's dark and there's a damp sweet smell in the room. This room looks like the kitchen and there's a smaller room next to it. There's a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating. There are boxes everywhere, newspapers, magazines, bits of food, mugs, empty tins. We can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom, a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window. Grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed. Laman, is that you? Get up, will you, get up.
What? What? What? What?
There's trouble. Angela is gettin' evicted with the children an' 'tis delvin'out of the heavens. They need a bit of shelter till
they get on their feet an' I have no room for them. You can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldn't do because the small ones wouldn't be able to climb and they'd fall down an' get killed so you go up there an' they can move in here.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
He hoists himself from the bed and there's a whiskey smell. He goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft.
Grandma says, That's fine now. Ye can move up here tonight an' ye won't have the eviction men coming after ye.
Grandma tells Mam she's going home. She's tired and drenched and she's not twenty-five anymore. She says there's no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that's up in Laman Griffin's. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we're having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won't make us go to school tomorrow. We're moving so far from Leamy's School now maybe we'll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol'Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson.
Mam says she's glad it's late and there's no one on the streets to see our shame.
Once we get to the house we take Alphie and everything else from the pram so that Malachy and I can run back down to Roden Lane for the trunk. Mam says she'd die if she lost that trunk and everything in it.
Malachy and I sleep at opposite ends of the small bed. Mam takes the big bed with Alphie beside her and Michael at the bottom. Everything is damp and musty and Laman Griffin snores over our heads. There are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step.
But I'm twelve going on thirteen and I might be too old for angels.
It's still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and Laman Griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest. The floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and Mam hisses at us to be quiet. He grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door. Mam whispers, The coast is clear, go back to sleep. Ye can stay at home today.
We can't sleep. We're in a new house, we have to pee and we want to explore. The lavatory is outside, about ten steps from the back door, our own lavatory, with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the Limerick Leader Laman Griffin left behind for wiping himself. There is a long backyard, a garden with tall grass and weeds, an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant, tin cans galore, old papers and magazines rotting into the earth, a rusted sewing machine, a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence.
Michael gets a notion in his head that this is Africa and keeps asking, Where's Tarzan? Where's Tarzan? He runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate Tarzan yodeling from tree to tree. Malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us, They have gardens. They're growing things. We can grow things. We can have our own spuds and everything.
Mam calls from the back door, See if ye can find anything to start the fire in here.
There's a wooden shed built against the back of the house. It's collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire. Mam is
disgusted with the wood we bring in. She says it's rotten and full of white maggots but beggars can't be choosers. The wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape. Michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know he's sorry for everything in the world.
Mam tells us this house used to be a shop, that Laman Griffin's mother sold groceries through the little window and that's how she was able to send Laman away to Rockwell College so that he could wind up as an officer in the Royal Navy. Oh, he was, indeed. An officer in the Royal Navy, and here's a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous American film star Jean Harlow. He was never the same after he met Jean Harlow. He fell madly in love with her but what was the use? She was Jean Harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the Royal Navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the Navy. Now look at him, a common laborer for the Electricity Supply Board and a house that's a disgrace. You'd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it. You can see Laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place.
There are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil. While Mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads. Malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when Mam comes back she says, What's that horrible stink? and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy. She makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called The Illustrated London News so old they have pictures of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward waving. There are bars of Pear's soap and a thick book called Pear's Encyclopedia, which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and that's all I want to know.
There are bottles of Sloan's Liniment, which Mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp. The bottles say, Here's the pain, Where's the Sloan's? There are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with women's hats that crumble when you touch them. There are bags with corsets, garters, women's high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks, bright eyes and a curl in your hair. There are letters from General Eoin O'Duffy to Gerard Griffin, Esq., saying welcome to the ranks of the National Front, the Irish Blueshirts, that it is a privilege to know a man like Gerard Griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education, his Royal Navy training, his reputation as a great rugby player on the Young Munster team that won the national championship, the Bateman Cup. General O'Duffy is forming an Irish Brigade that will soon sail off to Spain to fight with that great Catholic Generalissimo Franco himself, and Mr. Griffin would be a powerful addition to the Brigade.
Mam says Laman's mother wouldn't let him go. She didn't spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to Spain for Franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the Electricity Supply Board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but Friday when he drank his pint and moaned over Jean Harlow.
Mam is happy we'll have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed.
We work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside. Mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air. She says it's a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace, ease and comfort, and won't it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the English do.
Laman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he's too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night.
When we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he's worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I'm coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He's fed up, he's finished with the climbing, he's going to use his mother's lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full, and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot, empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? and he laughs, Woman's work, Angela, woman's work and free rent.
Laman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books, one on angling, one on gardening. He writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the Electricity Supply Board and from now on Frank McCourt will be getting his books. He knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what he's told, thank you.
The librarian reads the note and says 'tis an awful pity about Mr. Griffin, he's a true gentleman and a man of great learning, you wouldn't believe the books he reads, sometimes four a week, that one day he took home a book in French, French, if you don't mind, on the history of the rudder, the rudder, if you don't mind, she'd give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning, packed, if you don't mind.
She picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about English gardens. She says, I know what he likes in the fishing department, and chooses a book called In Search of the Irish Salmon by Brigadier General Hugh Colton. Oh, says the librarian, he reads hundreds of books about English officers fishing in Ireland. I've read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in Ireland after all they put up with in India and Africa and other desperate
places. At least the people here are polite. We're known for that, the politeness, not running around throwing spears at people.
Laman lies in the bed, reads his books, talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and he'll be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when he's not gardening he'll be roaming the rivers around Limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water. His mother left a recipe for salmon that's a family secret and if he had the time and his legs weren't killing him he'd find it someplace in this house. He says now that I'm reliable I can get a book for myself every week but don't be bringing home filth. I want to know what the filth is but he won't tell me so I'll have to find out for myself.
Mam says she wants to join the library too but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M. Brame or any other nice writer. She doesn't want any books about English officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other. There's enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other.
Grandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in Roden Lane and the chill turned into pneumonia. They shifted her to the City Home Hospital and now she's dead.
Her oldest son, my uncle Tom, thought he'd go to England to work like other men in the lanes of Limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to Limerick and now he's dead.
His wife, Galway Jane, followed him, and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages. The oldest boy, Gerry, ran away and joined the Irish army, deserted and crossed to the English army. The oldest girl, Peggy, went to Aunt Aggie and lives in misery.
The Irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the Army School of Music. They accept my brother, Malachy, and he goes off to Dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet.
Now I have only two brothers at home and Mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes.
XIII
Boys from my class at Leamy's School are going on a weekend cycling trip to Killaloe. They tell me I should borrow a bicycle and come. All I need is a blanket, a few spoons of tea and sugar and a few cuts of bread to keep me going. I'll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin's bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he'll surely let me borrow it for the two days in Killaloe.
The best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he's in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands. The grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. He drinks his stout and laughs that there's nothing like a great bloody steak of a Friday night and if that's the worst sin he ever commits he'll float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha.
Of course you can have my bike, he says. Boy should be able to get out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it. You can't be getting something for nothing, isn't that right?
'Tis.
And I have a job for you. You don't mind doing a bit of a job, do
you?
I don't.
And you'd like to help your mother?
I would.
Well, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want
you to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under the tap abroad and climb back up with it.
I don't want to empty his chamber pot but I dream of cycling miles on the road to Killaloe, fields and sky far from this house, a swim in the Shannon, a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. I climb up and under the bed there's the plain white chamber pot streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently at the edge of the loft so that it won't spill, climb down to the chair, reach for the chamber pot, bring it down, turn my face away, hold it while I step down to the table, place it on the chair, step to the floor, take the chamber pot to the lavatory, empty it, and get sick behind the lavatory till I get used to this job.
Laman says I'm a good boy and the bike is mine anytime I want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and I'm there to run to the shop for his cigarettes, go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants. He says, You have a great way with a chamber pot. He laughs and Mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace.
It's raining so hard one day, Miss O'Riordan the librarian says, Don't go out in that or you'll ruin the books you're carrying. Sit down over there and behave yourself. You can read all about the saints while you're waiting.
There are four big books, Butler's Lives of the Saints. I don't want to spend my life reading about saints but when I start I wish the rain would last forever. Whenever you see pictures of saints, men or women, they're always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise. Uncle Pa Keating says he can't think of a single saint in heaven he'd want to sit down and have a pint with. The saints in these books are different. There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema.
I have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity.
Now I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that
word and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything.
All I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word.
All these virgin martyrs are told by Roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the Roman gods but they say, Nay, and the judges have them tortured and killed. My favorite is St. Christina the Astonishing who takes ages to die. The judge says, Cut off her breast, and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind. Another judge is brought on the case and he says, Cut off the other breast, and the same thing happens. They try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them. They try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself. Then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job. The feast of St. Christina the Astonishing is the twenty-fourth of July and I think I'll keep that for myself along with the feast of St. Francis of Assisi on the fourth of October. The librarian says, You have to go home now, the rain is stopped, and when I'm going out the door she calls me back. She wants to write a note to my mother and she doesn't mind one bit if I read it. The note says, Dear Mrs. McCourt, Just when you think Ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the Lives of the Saints he doesn't realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid Lives. I think, Mrs. McCourt, you might have a future priest on your hands and I will light a candle in hopes it comes true. I remain, Yours truly, Catherine O'Riordan, Asst. Librarian.
Hoppy O'Halloran is the only master in Leamy's National School who ever sits. That's because he's the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg. The other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when you'll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy. If Hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes.
There are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about America. He says, My boys, from the frozen wastes of North Dakota to the fragrant orange groves of Florida, Americans enjoy all climates. He talks about American history, If the American farmer, with flintlock and musket, could wrest from the English a continent, surely we, warriors ever, can recover our island.
If we don't want him tormenting us with algebra or Irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about America and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day.
He sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Sioux, Apache, Iroquois. Poetry, my boys, poetry. And listen to the chiefs, Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the genius, Geronimo.
In seventh class he hands out a small book, a poem that goes on for pages and pages, The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith. He says that this seems to be a poem about England but it is a lament for the poet's native land, our own native land, Ireland. We are to get this poem by heart, twenty lines a night to be recited every morning. Six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand. He tells us put the books under the desks
and the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village.
Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way, With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,
There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule
The village master taught his little school.
A man severe he was and stern to view, I knew him well, and every truant knew.
Full well the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's disaster in his morning face.
Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee At all his jokes for many a joke had he.
Full well the busy whisper circling round Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.
He always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage, Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, The love he bore to learning was in fault.
The village all declared how much he knew.
'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, And even the story ran that he could gauge.
In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, While words of learned length and thundering sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around.
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew.
We know he loves these lines because they're about a schoolmaster, about him, and he's right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent.
I think it's shining, sir.
Pithy, Clarke, but adequate. McCourt, give us a sentence with pithy.
Clarke is pithy but adequate, sir.
Adroit, McCourt. You have a mind for the priesthood, my boy, or politics. Think of that.
I will, sir.
Tell your mother come and see me.
I will, sir.
Mam says, No, I could never go near Mr. O'Halloran. I don't have a
decent dress or a proper coat. What does he want to see me for? I don't know.
Well, ask him.
I can't. He'll kill me. If he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick.
She comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway. He tells her that her son Frank must continue school. He must not fall into the
messenger boy trap. That leads nowhere. Take him up to the Christian Brothers, tell them I sent you, tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that, university.
He tells her he did not become headmaster of Leamy's National School to preside over an academy of messenger boys.
Mam says, Thank you, Mr. O'Halloran.
I wish Mr. O'Halloran would mind his own business. I don't want to go to the Christian Brothers. I want to quit school forever and get a job, get my wages every Friday, go to the pictures on Saturday nights like everyone.
A few days later Mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash, we're going to the Christian Brothers. I tell her I don't want to go, I want to work, I want to be a man. She tells me stop the whining, I'm going to secondary school and we'll all manage somehow. I'm going to school if she has to scrub floors and she'll practice on my face.
She knocks on the door at the Christian Brothers and says she wants to see the superior, Brother Murray. He comes to the door, looks at my mother and me and says, What?
Mam says, This is my son, Frank. Mr. O'Halloran at Leamy's says he's bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school?
We don't have room for him, says Brother Murray and closes the door in our faces.
Mam turns away from the door and it's a long silent walk home. She takes off her coat, makes tea, sits by the fire. Listen to me, she says. Are you listening?
I am.
That's the second time a door was slammed in your face by the Church.
Is it? I don't remember.
Stephen Carey told you and your father you couldn't and closed the door in your face. Do you remember that?
I do.
And now Brother Murray slams the door in your face. I don't mind. I want to get a job.
Her face tightens and she's angry. You are never to
be an altar boy
let anybody
slam the door in your face again. Do you hear me?
She starts to cry by the fire, Oh, God, I didn't bring ye into the
world to be a family of messenger boys.
I don't know what to do or say, I'm so relieved I don't have to
stay in school for five or six more years. I'm free.
I'm thirteen going on fourteen and it's June, the last month of school forever. Mam takes me to see the priest, Dr. Cowpar, about getting a job as telegram boy. The supervisor in the post office, Mrs. O'Connell, says, Do you know how to cycle, and I lie that I do. She says I can't start till I'm fourteen so come back in August.
Mr. O'Halloran tells the class it's a disgrace that boys like McCourt, Clarke, Kennedy, have to hew wood and draw water. He is disgusted by this free and independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.
You must get out of this country, boys. Go to America, McCourt. Do you hear me?
I do, sir.
Priests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions, Redemptorists, Franciscans, Holy Ghost Fathers, all converting the distant heathen. I ignore them. I'm going to America till one priest catches my attention. He says he comes from the order of the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic Bedouin tribes and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.
I ask for the application.
I will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor. The parish priest writes the letter on the spot. He would have been glad to see me go last year. The doctor says, What's this?
That's an application to join the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the Sahara and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.
Oh, yeh? French Foreign Legion, is it? Do you know the preferred form of transportation in the Sahara Desert?
Trains?
No. It's the camel. Do you know what a camel is?
It has a hump. It has more than a hump. It has a nasty, mean
disposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites. Do you know where it bites?
In the Sahara?
No, you omadhaun. It bites your shoulder, rips it right off. Leaves you standing there tilted in the Sahara. How would you like that, eh? And what class of a spectacle you'd be strolling down the street, lopsided in Limerick. What girl in her right mind will look at an ex-White Father with one miserable scrawny shoulder? And look at your eyes. They're bad enough here in Limerick. In the Sahara they'll fester and rot and fall out of your head. How old are you?
Thirteen.
Go home to your mother.
It's not our house and we don't feel free in it the way we did in
Roden Lane, up in Italy or down in Ireland. When Laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet. We stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside there's nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp.
Mam tells us go to bed, she'll be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with Laman's last mug of tea. We often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking, grunting, moaning. There are nights when she never comes down and Michael and Alphie have the big bed to themselves. Malachy says she stays up there because it's too hard for her to climb down in the dark.
He's only twelve and he doesn't understand.
I'm thirteen and I think they're at the excitement up there.
I know about the excitement and I know it's a sin but how can it be
a sin if it comes to me in a dream where American girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the Lyric Cinema and I wake up pushing and pumping? It's a sin when you're wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in Leamy's schoolyard after Mr. O'Dea roared the Sixth Commandment at us, Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, which means impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, and that's what adultery is, Dirty Things in General.
One Redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the Sixth Commandment. He says impurity is so grave a sin the Virgin Mary turns her face away and weeps.
And why does she weep, boys? She weeps because of you and what you are doing to her Beloved Son. She weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of Limerick boys defiling themselves, polluting themselves, interfering with themselves, abusing themselves, soiling their young bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost. Our Lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her Beloved Son, that once more you hammer into His dear head the crown of thorns, that you reopen those ghastly wounds. In an agony of thirst He hangs on the cross and what is He offered by those perfidious Romans? A lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into His poor mouth, a mouth that moves rarely except to pray, to pray even for you, boys, even for you who nailed Him to that cross. Consider Our Lord's suffering. Consider the crown of thorns. Consider a small pin driven into your skull, the agony of the piercing. Consider then twenty thorns driven into your head. Reflect, meditate on the nails tearing His hands, His feet. Could you endure a fraction of that agony? Take that pin again, that mere pin. Force it into your side. Enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance. Oh, boys, the devil wants your souls. He wants you with him in hell and know this, that every time you interfere with yourself, every time you succumb to the vile sin of self- abuse you not only nail Christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself. Retreat from the abyss, boys. Resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself.
I can't stop interfering with myself. I pray to the Virgin Mary and tell her I'm sorry I put her Son back on the cross and I'll never do it again but I can't help myself and swear I'll go to confession and after that, surely after that, I'll never never do it again. I don't want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks.
The priests of Limerick have no patience with the likes of me. I go to confession and they hiss that I'm not in a proper spirit of repentance, that if I were I'd give up this hideous sin. I go from church to church looking for an easy priest till Paddy Clohessy tells me there's one in the Dominican church who's ninety years old and deaf as a turnip. Every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that I should pray for him. Sometimes he falls asleep and I don't have the heart to wake him up so I go to Communion the next day without penance or absolution. It's not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely I'm in a state of grace just for going to confession. Then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and it's not my man at all, it's a young priest with a big ear like a seashell. He'll surely hear everything.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession.
And what have you done since then, my child?
I hit my brother, I went on the mooch from school, I lied to my mother.
Yes, my child, and what else?
I – I - I did dirty things, Father.
Ah, my child, was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast?
Some class of beast. I never heard of a sin like that before. This priest must be from the country and if he is he's opening up new worlds to me.
The night before I'm to go to Killaloe Laman Griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table. He tells Mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats. He throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling. I don't want to go. I want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if I say anything he won't let me have the bicycle tomorrow after I've waited three weeks.
When Mam gets the fire going and boils the water I remind him of his promise to loan me the bike.
Did you empty the chamber pot today?
Oh, I forgot. I'll do it this minute.
He shouts, You didn't empty my damn chamber pot. I promise you the
bike. I give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didn't do it.
I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.
You will, will you? And how do you think you'll get up to the loft? Are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips?
Mam says, Sure, he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes.
Well, you can bloody well forget about the bicycle. You didn't live up to the bargain.
But he couldn't do it, says Mam.
He tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire. He goes back to his fish and chips but I tell him again, You promised me. I emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks.
Shut up and go to bed.
You can't tell me go to bed. You're not my father, and you promised
me.
I'm telling you, as sure as God made little apples, that if I get
up from this table you'll be calling for your patron saint. You promised me.
He pushes the chair back from the table. He stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes. I'm telling you shut your gob, scabby
eyes.
I won't. You promised me.
He punches my shoulders and when I won't stop moves to my head. My
mother jumps up, crying, and tries to pull him away. He punches and kicks me into the bedroom but I keep saying, You promised me. He knocks me to my mother's bed and punches till I cover my face and head with my arms.
I'll kill you, you little shit.
Mam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen. She says, Come on, oh, come on. Eat your fish and chips. He's only a child. He'll get over it. I hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table.
I hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks. Hand me the matches, he says. By Jesus, I need a fag after that. There's a put-put sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother.
He says, I'm going to bed, and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table, pull up the chair, climb to the loft. The bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor.
I can hear Mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark. After what happened she'll surely want to get into her own bed and I'm ready to go to the small one against the wall. Instead, there's the sound of her climbing the chair, the table, the chair, crying up into the loft and telling Laman Griffin, He's only a boy, tormented with his eyes, and when Laman says, He's a little shit and I want him out of the house, she cries and begs till there's whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing.
In awhile they're snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me. I can't stay in this house for if Laman Griffin comes at me again I'll take a knife to his neck. I don't know what to do or where to go.
I leave the house and follow the streets from the Sarsfield Barracks to the Monument Café. I dream of how I'll get back at Laman some day. I'll go to America and see Joe Louis. I'll tell him my troubles and he'll understand because he comes from a poor family. He'll show me how to build up my muscles, how to hold my hands and use my feet. He'll show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send Laman flying. I'll drag Laman to the graveyard at Mungret where his family and Mam's family are buried and I'll cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he won't be able to move and he'll beg for his life and I'll say, End of the road, Laman, you're going to meet your Maker, and he'll beg and beg while I trickle dirt on his face till it's covered completely and he's gasping and asking God for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and I'll be laughing away because he's not in a state of grace after the excitement and he's going to hell as sure as God made little apples as he used to say himself.
The streets are dark and I have to keep an eye out in case I might be lucky like Malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers. There's nothing on the ground. If I find my uncle, Ab Sheehan, he might give me some of his Friday night fish and chips, but they tell me in the café he came and went already. I'm thirteen now so I don't call him Uncle Pat anymore. I call him Ab or The Abbot like everybody else. Surely if I go to Grandma's house he'll give me a piece of bread or something and maybe he'll let me stay the night. I can tell him I'll be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way.
He's sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips, dropping to the floor the Limerick Leader they were wrapped in, wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket. He looks at me, That face is all swole. Did you fall on that face?
I tell him I did because there's no use telling him anything else. He wouldn't understand. He says, You can stay in me mother's bed tonight. You can't walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head.
He says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease.
I wonder what I'll do tomorrow.
XIV
In the morning The Abbot gives me the money to go to Kathleen O'Connell's for bread, margarine, tea, milk. He boils water on the gas ring and tells me I can have a mug of tea and, Go aisy with the sugar, I'm not a millionaire. You can have a cut o' bread but don't make it too thick.
It's July and school is over forever. In a few weeks I'll be delivering telegrams at the post office, working like a man. In the weeks I'm idle I can do anything I like, get up in the morning, stay in bed, take long walks out the country like my father, wander around Limerick. If I had the money I'd go over to the Lyric Cinema, eat sweets, see Errol Flynn conquering everyone in sight. I can read the English and Irish papers The Abbot brings home or I can use the library cards of Laman Griffin and my mother till I'm found out.
Mam sends Michael with a milk bottle of warm tea, a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping, a note to say Laman Griffin isn't angry anymore and I can come back. Michael says, Are you coming home, Frankie?
No.
Ah, do, Frankie. Come on.
I live here now. I'm never going back.
But Malachy is gone to the army and you're here and I have no big
brother. All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He's not even four and can't talk right.
I can't go back. I'm never going back. You can come here any time you like.
His eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart I want to say, All right, I'll come with you. I'm only saying that. I know I'll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don't know if I can look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement. When I start that job at the post office I'll buy him shoes so I will. I'll give him an egg and take him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we'll go to Naughton's and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile. I'll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world. We'll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, toast with butter and marmalade galore. We'll take our time and listen to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I'll buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won't be hanging out of our pants and we won't have the shame. The thought of the shame brings a pain
in my heart and starts me sniffling. The Abbot says, What's up with you? Didn't you have your bread? Didn't you have your tay? What more do you want? 'Tis an egg you'll be lookin' for next.
There's no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living.
He complains he can't be feeding me forever and I'll have to get my own bread and tea. He doesn't want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away. He can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so he'll know how much I used and if I don't stop turning on that light he'll take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if I put another fuse in he'll have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas, which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep.
I get up early like Dad and go on long walks into the country. I walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at Mungret where my mother's relations are buried and I go up the boreen to the Norman castle at Carrigogunnell where Dad brought me twice. I climb to the top and Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did.
Sometimes I'm up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in French and when I see them in my mind I'm tempted and I climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over Carrigogunnell and fields beyond.
That's a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did I'm doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea.
Still, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again. I wouldn't want a small boy to be watching me. No, no, that would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking up she'd surely get excited and go at herself though I don't know if girls can go at themselves when they don't have anything to go at. No equipment, as Mikey Molloy used to say.
I wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he's dead now and I'll have to face a priest who'll go on about the millstone and the doom.
Doom. That's the favorite word of every priest in Limerick.
I walk back along O'Connell Avenue and Ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely there's no harm if I borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when I get my job at the post office. I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing, and that's not a mortal sin. Besides, I stood on top of a
castle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell. One sin, eternity. A dozen sins, eternity.
Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, as my mother would say. I drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman won't be blamed for not delivering. I like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which I swallowed raw with bits of shells and all. He said I'd grow up powerful if I had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day. Everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint.
Some houses get better bread than others. It costs more and that's what I take. I feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but I can't let myself starve to death. If I starve I'll never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office, which means I'll have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to America and if I can't go to America I might as well jump into the River Shannon. It's only a few weeks till I get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people won't collapse with the hunger till then. They can always send the maid out for more. That's the difference between the poor and the rich. The poor can't send out for more because there's no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldn't have a maid to send. It's the maids I have to worry about. I have to be careful when I borrow the milk and the bread and they're at the front doors polishing knobs, knockers and letter boxes. If they see me they'll be running to the woman of the house, Oh, madam, madam, there's an urchin beyant that's makin' off with all the milk and bread.
Beyant. Maids talk like that because they're all from the country, Mullingar heifers, says Paddy Clohessy's uncle, beef to the heels, and they wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.
I bring home the bread and even if The Abbot is surprised he doesn't say, Where did you get it? because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you. He just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind. He tells me, That's me mug and don't be drinkin' your tay oush of ish.
Oush of ish. That's the Limerick slum talk that always worried Dad. He said, I don't want my sons growing up in a Limerick lane saying, Oush of ish. It's common and low-class. Say out of it properly.
And Mam said, I hope it keeps fine for you but you're not doing much to get us oush of ish.
Out beyond Ballinacurra I climb orchard walls for apples. If there's a dog I move on because I don't have Paddy Clohessy's way of talking to them. Farmers come at me but they're always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me I jump over walls where they can't take a bike.
The Abbot knows where I got the apples. If you grow up in the lanes of Limerick you're bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later. Even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say you're a sissy.
I always offer The Abbot an apple but he won't eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head. He has five left and he won't risk leaving them in an apple. If I cut the apple into slices he still won't
eat it because that's not the proper way to eat an apple. That's what he says and if I say, You slice bread before you eat it, don't you? he says, Apples is apples and bread is bread.
That's how you talk when you're dropped on your head.
Michael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread. I tell him I don't need it anymore. Tell Mam I'm taking care of myself and I don't need her tea and fried bread, thank you very much. Michael is delighted when I give him an apple and I tell him come every second day and he can have more. That stops him from asking me to go back to Laman Griffin's and I'm glad it stops his tears.
There's a market down in Irishtown where the farmers come on Saturdays with their vegetables, hens, eggs, butter. If I'm there early they'll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars. At the end of the day they'll give me vegetables they can't sell, anything crushed, bruised or rotten in parts. One farmer's wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me, Fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from Mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl they'll stick in your gullet, so they will.
She's a farmer's wife and that's how they talk.
I'm not much better than a beggar now myself the way I stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when they're closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease. If they're in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping.
The paper I like is the News of the World. It's banned in Ireland but people sneak it in from England for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there. Then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldn't find in Limerick, getting divorces, committing adultery.
Adultery. I still have to find out what that word means, look it up in the library. I'm sure it's worse than what the masters taught us, bad thoughts, bad words, bad deeds. I take my chips home and get into bed like The Abbot. If he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the Limerick Leader and singing ""The Road to Rasheen. "" I eat my chips. I lick the News of the World. I lick the stories about people doing shocking things. I lick the girls in their bathing suits and when there's nothing left to lick I look at the girls till The Abbot blows out the light and I'm committing a mortal sin under the blanket.
I can go to the library any time with Mam's card or Laman Griffin's. I'll never be caught because Laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a Saturday and Mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes.
Miss O'Riordan smiles. The Lives of the Saints are waiting for you, Frank. Volumes and volumes. Butler, O'Hanlon, Baring Gould. I've told the head librarian all about you and she's so pleased she's ready to give you your own grown-up card. Isn't that wonderful?
Thanks, Miss O'Riordan.
I'm reading all about St. Brigid, virgin, February first. She was so beautiful that men from all over Ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important. She didn't want to marry anyone so she prayed to God for help and He caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of Ireland lost interest.
Then there's St. Wilgefortis, virgin martyr, July twentieth. Her mother had nine children, all at the same time, four sets of twins and Wilgefortis the odd one, all winding up martyrs for the faith. Wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily. Wilgefortis was desperate and God helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face, which made the King of Sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all.
St. Wilgefortis is the one you pray to if you're an Englishwoman with a troublesome husband.
The priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like St. Agatha, February fifth. February is a powerful month for virgin martyrs. Sicilian pagans ordered Agatha to give up her faith in Jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said, Nay. They tortured her, stretched her on the rack, tore her sides with iron hooks, burned her with blazing torches, and she said, Nay, I will not deny Our Lord. They crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired, giving praise.
Virgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot.
How is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said, I'll go away for awhile, three years, and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladies-in- waiting and their companions, ten thousand. They sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her. Why couldn't she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn?
I like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn't live in a palace like the bishop of Limerick. He lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread. He was walking along one day and a leper said, Hoy, St. Moling, where are you going? I'm going to Mass, says St. Moling. Well, I'd like to go to Mass too, so why don't you hoist me up on your back and carry me? St. Moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain. Your hair shirt, he said, is hard on my sores, take it off. St. Moling took off the shirt and off they went again. Then the leper says, I need to blow my nose. St. Moling says, I don't have any class of a handkerchief, use your hand. The leper says, I can't hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time. All right, says St. Moling, you can blow into my hand. That won't do, says the leper, I barely have a hand left with the leprosy and I can't hold on and blow into your hand. If you were a proper saint you'd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head. St. Moling didn't want to suck the leper's snot but he did and offered it up and praised God for the privilege.
I could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head when he was a baby and desperate but I don't understand why God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers' heads. I don't understand God at all and even if I'd like to be a saint and have
everyone adore me I'd never suck the snot of a leper. I'd like to be a saint but if that's what you have to do I think I'll stay the way I am.
Still, I'm ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O'Riordan over a book someone left on the table. The author is Lin Yütang. Anyone can tell this is a Chinese name and I'm curious to know what the Chinese talk about. It's a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary. Turgid. He says, The male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice.
Turgid. The dictionary says swollen and that's what I am, standing there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy was talking about all along, that we're no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and it's shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this.
My father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step.
Miss O'Riordan wants to know what word I'm looking for. She always looks worried when I'm at the dictionary so I tell her I'm looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word.
And what's this? she says. This is not the Lives of the Saints.
She picks up Lin Yütang and starts reading the page where I left the book face down on the table.
Mother o' God. Is this what you were reading? I saw this in your hand.
Well, I-I-only wanted to see if the Chinese, if the Chinese, ah, had any saints.
Oh, indeed, you did. This is disgraceful. Filth. No wonder the Chinese are the way they are. But what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you, now that I look at you, have a bit of the slanty eye yourself. You are to leave this library at once.
But I'm reading the Lives of the Saints.
Out or I'll call the head librarian and she'll have the guards on you. Out. You should be running to the priest and confessing your sins. Out, and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and Mr. Griffin. I have a good mind to write to your poor mother and I would if I thought it wouldn't destroy her entirely. Lin Yütang, indeed. Out.
There's no use trying to talk to librarians when they're in that state. You could stand there for an hour telling them all you've read about Brigid and Wilgefortis and Agatha and Ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of Lin Yütang.
The People's Park is behind the library. It's a sunny day, the grass is dry, and I'm worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and I'm looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till I'm having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the News of the World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him.
The day before my fourteenth birthday I see myself in the glass in Grandma's sideboard. The way I look how can I ever start my job at the post office. Everything is torn, shirt, gansey, short pants, stockings, and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely. Relics of oul'
decency, my mother would call them. If my clothes are bad I'm worse. No matter how I drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions. The best cure for standing up hair is spit, only it's hard to spit on your own head. You have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll. My eyes are red and oozing yellow, there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot I'll never be able to smile in my life.
I have no shoulders and I know the whole world admires shoulders. When a man dies in Limerick the women always say, Grand man he was, shoulders that big and wide he wouldn't come in the door for you, had to come in sideways. When I die they'll say, Poor little divil, died without a sign of a shoulder. I wish I had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know I was at least fourteen years of age. All the boys in Leamy's had shoulders except for Fintan Slattery and I don't want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer. If I had any money left I'd light a candle to St. Francis and ask him if there's any chance God could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders. Or if I had a stamp I could write to Joe Louis and say, Dear Joe, Is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor?
I have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma's clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won't rain, pray they'll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life.
I can't go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the News of the World and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I'm hungry I know he'll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I'm staying in Grandma's house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she'll come over and throw me into the street.
He hides the bread when he's finished and I can never find it. You would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head. Then I realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer. The minute I hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory I run downstairs, pull the loaf from the pocket, cut off a thick slice, back into the pocket, up the stairs and into bed. He can never say a word, never accuse me. You'd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him, not even Aunt Aggie. Besides, she'd bark at him and say, What are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket? That's no place for a loaf of bread.
I chew the bread slowly. One mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if I wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling.
I look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes. Other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind. Mine hang from the line like dead dogs.
The sun is bright but it's cold and damp in the house and I wish I had something to wear in the bed. I have no other clothes and if I touch anything of The Abbot's he'll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find in
the wardrobe is Grandma's old black woolen dress. You're not supposed to wear your Grandmother's old dress when she's dead and you're a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you're in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself wasn't too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream.
The worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother's bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls on his arse outside South's pub after a night of drinking pints and people who can't mind their own business rush to Aunt Aggie's house to tell her so that she gets Uncle Pa Keating to help her carry The Abbot home and upstairs to where you're sleeping and she barks at you, What are you doin' in this house, in that bed? Get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle Pat that fell down, and when you don't move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling Mother o' God what are you doin' in me dead mother's dress?
That's the worst thing of all because it's hard to explain that you're getting ready for the big job in your life, that you washed your clothes, they're drying abroad on the line, and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house, and it's even harder to talk to Aunt Aggie when The Abbot is groaning in the bed, Me feet is like a fire, put water on me feet, and Uncle Pa Keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem. You don't know what to do when Aunt Aggie tells you, Get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle. Should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are? One minute she's screaming, What are you doin' in me poor mother's dress? the next she's telling you put on that bloody kettle. I tell her I washed my clothes for the big job.
What big job?
Telegram boy at the post office.
She says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be
in a desperate way altogether, go down and put on that kettle.
The next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the
kettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and Kathleen Purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat. God, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' in your grandmother's dress? and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother's dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you'll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmother's dress.
Now Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, Mammy, wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmother's dress. You know that once Kathleen Purcell gets
a bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem.
By the time the kettle boils The Abbot is asleep from the drink and Aunt Aggie says she and Uncle Pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesn't mind if I have a drop myself. Uncle Pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a Dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aunt Aggie says, Get up, you oul' eejit, and stop makin' a feck of religion. Then she says, And you what are you doin' in this house?
I can't tell her about Mam and Laman Griffin and the excitement in the loft. I tell her I was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from Laman Griffin's house to the post office and as soon as I get on my feet we'll surely find a decent place and we'll all move on, my mother and brothers and all.
Well, she says, that's more than your father would do.
XV
It's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma's gramophone where she used to keep the records I'll find a jar of jam.
He can't read, he can't write, but he knows where to hide the jam.
I bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it's the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother's black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, 'tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin.
On my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a doctor. She says, What time do you have to be at that job?
Nine.
All right.
She turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. She
doesn't say a word and I wonder if she's going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother's bed and wearing her black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and you'll be an hour late. If they want to argue I'll go up and argue.
Why do I have to be an hour late?
Do what you're bloody well told.
There are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall. There are
two women at a desk, one fat, one thin. The thin one says, Yes? My name is Frank McCourt, miss, and I'm here to start work.
What kind of work would that be now?
Telegram boy, miss.
The thin one cackles, Oh, God, I thought you were here to clean the
lavatories.
No, miss. My mother brought a note from the priest, Dr. Cowpar, and
there's supposed to be a job.
Oh, there is, is there? And do you know what day this is?
I do, miss. 'Tis my birthday. I'm fourteen.
Isn't that grand, says the fat woman. Today is Thursday, says the
thin woman.
Your job starts on Monday. Go away and wash yourself and come back then.
The telegram boys along the wall are laughing. I don't know why but I feel my face turning hot. I tell the women, Thank you, and on the way out I hear the thin one, Jesus above, Maureen, who dragged in that specimen? and they laugh along with the telegram boys.
Aunt Aggie says, Well? and I tell her I don't start till Monday. She says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in.
Carbolic soap.
They smell like dead pigeons and you're making a laughingstock of the whole family.
She takes me to Roche's Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. She gets on the bus to go back up O'Connell Street too fat and lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the clothes for my new job.
I turn toward Arthur's Quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that the whole world won't see the tears of a man the day he's fourteen.
Monday morning I'm up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit. The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is it gettin' married you are? and goes back to sleep.
Mrs. O'Connell, the fat woman, says, Well, well, aren't we the height of fashion, and the thin one, Miss Barry, says, Did you rob a bank on the weekend? and there's a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall.
I'm told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams. Some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam. They can stay in the post office forever if they like, take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs. The post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year. Everyone says these are good jobs, steady and pensionable and respectable, and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life, so you don't.
Temporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen. There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses. There are no waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops.
Mrs. O'Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch. She says there's a great shortage of bicycles so I'll have to walk my first batch of telegrams. I'm to go to the farthest address
first, work my way back, and don't take all day. She's long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I'm not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if I do I'll be found out. I'm not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no attention. Deliver the telegrams and don't be a sissy.
One telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Arthur's Quay and that couldn't be anyone but Paddy's mother.
Is that you, Frankie McCourt? she says. God, I wouldn't know you you're that big. Come in, will you.
She's wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes. There are two children on the floor playing with a toy train. On the table there is a teapot, cups with saucers, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, butter, jam. There are two beds over by the window where there were none before. The big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what I'm wondering. He's gone, she says, but he's not dead. Gone t' England with Paddy. Have a cup o' tay an' a bit o' bread. You need it, God help us. You look like one left over from the Famine itself. Ate that bread an' jam an' build yourself up. Paddy always talked about you and Dennis, my poor husband that was in the bed, never got over the day your mother came an' sang the song about the Kerry dancing. He's over in England now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week. You'd wonder what the English are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches. Paddy has a grand job in a pub in Cricklewood, which is in England. Dennis would still be here if it wasn't for Paddy climbin' the wall for the tongue.
Tongue?
Dennis had the craving, so he did, for a nice sheep's head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to Barry the butcher with the last few shillings I had. I boiled that head an' sick an' all as he was Dennis couldn't wait for it to be done. He was a demon there in the bed callin' for the head an' when I gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin' the marrow outa every inch of that head. Then he finishes an' he says, Mary, where is the tongue?
What tongue? says I.
The tongue of this sheep. Every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and there's a great lack of tongue in this head. Go up to Barry the butcher and demand it.
So up with me to Barry the butcher and he said, That bloody sheep came in here bleatin'an'cryin'so much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesn't quit I'll cut his tongue and throw it to the cat.
Back I go to Dennis and he gets frantic in the bed. I want that tongue, he says. All the nourishment is in the tongue. And what do you think happens next but my Paddy, that was your friend, goes up to Barry the butcher after dark, climbs the wall, cuts the tongue of a sheep's head that's on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed. Of course I have to boil that tongue with salt galore and Dennis, God love him, ates it, lies back in the bed a minute, throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption, he's not going to die in that bed, if he's going to die at all it might as well be under a German bomb with him
making a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond.
She shows me a letter from Paddy. He's working in his uncle Anthony's pub twelve hours a day, twenty-five shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich. He's delighted when the Germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed. At night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs. He will send his mother two pounds every month and he's saving the rest to bring her and the family to England where they'll be much better off in one room in Cricklewood than ten rooms in Arthur's Quay. She'll be able to get a job no bother. You'd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country that's at war especially with Yanks pouring in and spending money right and left. Paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of London where Yanks leave tips big enough to feed an Irish family of six for a week.
Mrs. Clohessy says, We have enough money for food and shoes at last, thanks be to God and His Blessed Mother. You'll never guess who Paddy met over there in England fourteen years of age an' workin' like a man. Brendan Kiely, the one ye used to call Question. Workin' he is an' savin' so he can go an' join the Mounties an' ride all over Canada like Nelson Eddy singin' I'll be callin' you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. If it wasn't for Hitler we'd all be dead an' isn't that a terrible thing to say. And how's your poor mother, Frankie?
She's grand, Mrs. Clohessy.
No, she's not. I seen her in the Dispensary and she looks worse than my Dennis did in the bed. You have to mind your poor mother. You look desperate too, Frankie, with them two red eyes starin' outa your head. Here's a little tip for you. Thruppence. Buy yourself a sweet.
I will, Mrs. Clohessy.
Do.
***
At the end of the week Mrs. O'Connell hands me the first wages of
my life, a pound, my first pound. I run down the stairs and up to O'Connell Street, the main street, where the lights are on and people are going home from work, people like me with wages in their pockets. I want them to know I'm like them, I'm a man, I have a pound. I walk up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and hope they'll notice me. They don't. I want to wave my pound note at the world so they'll say, There he goes, Frankie McCourt the workingman, with a pound in his pocket.
It's Friday night and I can do anything I like. I can have fish and chips and go to the Lyric Cinema. No, no more Lyric. I don't have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the Indians killing General Custer and the Africans chasing Tarzan all over the jungle. I can go to the Savoy Cinema now, pay sixpence for a seat down front where there's a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh. After the film I can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs.
Michael is across the street calling me. He's hungry and wonders if there's any chance he could go to The Abbot's for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to Laman Griffin's. I tell him he doesn't have to worry about a bit of bread. We'll go to the Coliseum Café and have fish and chips, all he wants, lemonade galore, and then we'll go to see Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate. After the film we have tea and buns and we sing
and dance like Cagney all the way to The Abbot's. Michael says it must be great to be in America where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance. He's half asleep but he says he's going there some day to sing and dance and would I help him go and when he's asleep I start thinking about America and how I have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns. I'll have to save a few shillings from my pound because if I don't I'll be in Limerick forever. I'm fourteen now and if I save something every week surely I should be able to go to America by the time I'm twenty. There are telegrams for offices, shops, factories where there's no hope of a tip. Clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you. There are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road where there's no hope of a tip. Maids are like clerks, they don't look at you or say thank you. There are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids, too, even if they say poverty is noble. If you waited for tips from priests or nuns you'd die on their doorstep.
There are telegrams for people miles outside the city, farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs. There are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls. The gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns, flower beds, fountains to reach the big house. If the weather is fine people are playing croquet, the Protestant game, or strolling around, talking and laughing, all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and you'd never know there was a war on. There are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants' entrance don't you know any better.
People in the big houses have English accents and they don't tip telegram boys.
The best people for tips are widows, Protestant ministers' wives and the poor in general. Widows know when the telegram money order is due from the English government and they wait by the window. You have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys, Scrawby Luby, said an old widow of thirty-five had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next Saturday. He said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the Virgin Mary you'll go soft in no time.
Protestant ministers' wives would never carry on like Scrawby Luby's old widow unless they're widows themselves. Christy Wallace, who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day, says Protestants don't care what they do even if they're ministers' wives. They're doomed anyway, so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy. All the telegram boys like Protestant ministers' wives. They might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say, One moment, please, and give you sixpence. I'd like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence.
The Irishmen working in England send their telegram money orders on Friday nights and all day Saturday and that's when we get the good tips. The minute we deliver one batch we're out with another.
The worst lanes are in the Irishtown, off High Street or Mungret Street, worse than Roden Lane or O'Keeffe's Lane or any lane I lived in. There are lanes with channels running down the middle. Mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets. Children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water.
When you ride into a lane the children call out, Here's the telegram boy, here's the telegram boy. They run to you and the women wait at the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he's the hero of the family. Little girls know they're supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if you're in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God bless you an' all belongin' to you.
Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else. We are not to be doing things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message. They don't care if people are dying in the bed. They don't care if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor. We are to deliver the telegram and that's all. Mrs. O'Connell says, I know everything ye do, everything, for the people of Limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which I have here in my drawers.
A fine place to keep reports, says Toby Mackey under his breath.
But Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry don't know what it's like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and there's no light and there's a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me I'm starving with the hunger and I'd give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say I'm busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order that's pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order.
What are you supposed to do?
You're told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or you'll lose your job forever. But what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the Boer War hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and he'd be forever grateful if you'd go to Paddy Considine in the post office and tell him the situation and Paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are. Paddy Considine says no bother but don't tell anyone or I'd be out on my arse and so would you, son. The old man from the Boer War says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesn't have a thing in the house and he's freezing on top of it. He sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions.
I want to take the man from the Boer War and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling.
Mrs. Spillane in Pump Lane off Carey's Road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads, small bodies, and bits of legs that dangle
over the edges of the chairs. They look into the fire all day and say, Where's Daddy? They speak English like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up, Hung sup tea tea sup hung. Mrs. Spillane says that means, When are we getting our supper? She tells me she's lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and she's beside herself with the abuse she gets from the Dispensary over him being in England. The children are only four and they're very bright even if they can't walk or take care of themselves. If they could walk, if they were any way normal, she'd pack up and move to England out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us, De Valera in his mansion above in Dublin the dirty oul' bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell, God forgive me. The priests can go to hell too and I won't ask God to forgive me for saying the likes of that. There they are, the priests and the nuns telling us Jesus was poor and 'tis no shame, lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine, eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for Lent. Lent, my arse. What are we to give up when we have Lent all year long?
I want to take Mrs. Spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the Boer War and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling.
I can't leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman, Mrs. Gertrude Daly, all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a Limerick lane, arthritis, rheumatism, falling hair, a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger, and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark, her own teeth and perfect.
That's right, she says, me own teeth, and when I rot in the grave they'll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an' shiny an' I'll be declared a saint.
The telegram money order, three pounds, is from her son. It has a message, Happy Birthday, Mammy, Your fond son, Teddy. She says, A wonder he can spare it, the little shit, trottin' around with every tart in Piccadilly. She asks if I'd ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week. Would I boil
a potato for
bread, bring
O'Connor the
some soap so
grateful and
my troubles.
her, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of
her a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go to chemist for ointment for her sores and while I'm at it bring she can give her body a good scrub and she'll be forever
say a prayer for me and here's a couple of shillings for all
Ah, no thanks, ma'am.
Take the money. Little tip. You did me great favors.
I couldn't, ma'am, the way you are.
Take the money or I'll tell the post office you're not to deliver
my telegram anymore.
Oh, all right, ma'am. Thanks very much.
Good night, son. Be good to your mother.
Good night, Mrs. Daly.
School starts in September and some days Michael stops at The
Abbot's before the walk home to Laman Griffin's. On rainy days he says,
Can I stay here tonight? and soon he doesn't want to go back to Laman Griffin's at all. He's worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back.
When Mam comes looking for him I don't know what to say to her. I don't know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. She says, How's the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's. If the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with Alphie. She goes back to Laman's the next day but Michael stays and soon she's moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman's altogether.
The Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and she's cut off from the Dispensary. She's told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week that's more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job. Now I have to hand over my wages. Mam says, A pound? Is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather? This would be four dollars in America. Four dollars. And you couldn't feed a cat for four dollars in New York. If you were delivering telegrams for Western Union in New York you'd be earning twenty-five dollars a week and living in luxury. She always translates Irish money into American so that she won't forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there. Some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if I go to a film or buy a secondhand book there's nothing left, I won't be able to save for my fare, and I'll be stuck in Limerick till I'm an old man of twenty-five.
Malachy writes from Dublin to say he's fed up and doesn't want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band. He's home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with Michael, Alphie and me. He had his own army cot up there in Dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow. Now he's back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it. Mam says, Pity about you. I'm sorry for your troubles. The Abbot has his own bed, and my mother has the small room. We're all together again, no Laman tormenting us. We make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor. The Abbot says you're not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors, what are tables and chairs for? He tells Mam that Frankie is not right in the head and Mam says we'll all catch our death from the damp of the floor. We sit on the floor and sing and Mam and The Abbot sit on chairs. She sings ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" and the Abbot sings ""The Road to Rasheen"" and we still don't know what his song is about. We sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened, things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to America.
There are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful we're getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we'll be reported to the proper authorities.
The boys talk about her under their breath. Toby Mackey says, What that oul' bitch needs is a good rub o' the relic, a good rub o' the brush. Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank.
There is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I warned ye against the laughing. Mackey, what is it you're prattling about over there?
I said we'd all be better off out in the fresh air on this fine day delivering telegrams, Miss Barry.
I'm sure you did, Mackey. Your mouth is a lavatory. Did you hear
me?
I did, Miss Barry.
You have been heard on the stairs, Mackey. Yes, Miss Barry.
Shut up, Mackey.
I will, Miss Barry.
Not another word, Mackey.
No, Miss Barry.
I said shut up, Mackey.
All right, Miss Barry.
That's the end of it, Mackey. Don't try me. I won't, Miss Barry.
Mother o' God give me patience.
Yes, Miss Barry.
Take the last word, Mackey. Take it, take it, take it.
I will, Miss Barry.
Toby Mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me. He saw a film
called The Front Page and now he wants to go to America some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette. He keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens. Facts. He has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry, which is all you hear in Limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the English. Facts, Frankie. He writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels. We sit on the bench making sure we don't laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day that's two hundred a week and that's ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job. If we cycle one hundred and twenty-five miles in a week that's thirteen thousand miles in two years and that's halfway around the world, Frankie, and no wonder there isn't a scrap of flesh on our arses.
Toby says nobody knows Limerick like the telegram boy. We know every avenue, road, street, terrace, mews, place, close, lane. Jasus, says Toby, there isn't a door in Limerick we don't know. We knock on all kinds of doors, iron, oak, plywood. Twenty thousand doors, Frankie. We rap, kick, push. We ring and buzz bells. We shout and whistle, Telegram boy, telegram boy. We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under doors, throw them over the transom. We climb in windows where people are bedridden. We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner. You never know what's going to happen when you hand people their telegrams. They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they'll wake up at all and give you the tip. It's not a bit like delivering telegrams in America where Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun.
Toby Mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesn't give a fiddler's fart about anything and that's the way I'd like to be myself.
Mrs. O'Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don't have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there's the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn't be surprised because there's no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn't mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it's never a sin for an animal. I wouldn't mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what's passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there's a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that's better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that's better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop.
When I'm finished delivering the telegrams there's enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mother's relations are buried, the Guilfoyles and the Sheehans, where my mother wants to be buried. I can see from here the high ruins of Carrigogunnell Castle and there's plenty of time to cycle there, sit up on the highest wall, look at the Shannon flowing out to the Atlantic on its way to America and dream of the day I'll be sailing off myself.
The boys at the post office tell me I'm lucky to get the Carmody family telegram, a shilling tip, one of the biggest tips you'll ever get in Limerick. So why am I getting it? I'm the junior boy. They say, Well, sometimes Theresa Carmody answers the door. She has the consumption and they're afraid of catching it from her. She's seventeen, in and out of the sanatorium, and she'll never see eighteen. The boys at the post office say sick people like Theresa know there's little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything. Everything. That's what the consumption does to you, say the boys at the post office.
I cycle through wet November streets thinking of that shilling tip, and as I turn into the Carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and I skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand. Theresa Carmody opens the door. She has red hair. She had green eyes like the fields beyond Limerick. Her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white. She says, Oh, you're all wet and bleeding.
I skidded on my bike.
Come in and I'll put something on your cuts.
I wonder, Should I go in? I might get the consumption and that will be the end of me. I want to be alive when I'm fifteen and I want the shilling tip. Come in. You'll perish standing there.
She puts on the kettle for the tea. Then she dabs iodine on my cuts and I try to be a man and not whimper. She says, Oh, you're a great bit of a man. Go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire. Look, why don't you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire?
Ah, no.
Ah, do.
I will.
I drape my pants over the screen. I sit there watching the steam
rise and I watch myself rise and I worry she might come in and see me in my excitement.
There she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea. Lord, she says, you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but that's a fine boyo you have there.
She puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay. With her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and she's on the sofa don't stop or I'll die and she's crying and I'm crying for I don't know what's happening to me if I'm killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I'm riding to heaven I'm falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don't give a fiddler's fart.
We take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don't you have more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, I'm bleeding.
What's up with you?
I think it's because it's the first time.
I tell her, Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and
splash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you're very innocent. You're not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that.
I thought you were cut.
For weeks after that I deliver the telegram. Sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her. She never tells me she has the weakness. She never tells me she has the consumption. The boys at the post office say I must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and Theresa Carmody. I never tell them I stopped taking the shilling tip. I never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement. I never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and I can see the weakness on her and all I want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa.
One Saturday I'm told to deliver the telegram to Theresa's mother at her job in Woolworth's. I try to be casual. Mrs. Carmody, I always deliver the telegram to your, I think your daughter, Theresa?
Yes, she's in the hospital.
Is she in the sanatorium?
I said she's in the hospital.
She's like everyone else in Limerick, ashamed of the TB, and she
doesn't give me a shilling or any kind of tip. I cycle out to the
sanatorium to see Theresa. They say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult. I tell them I'm her cousin and I'll be fifteen in August. They tell me go away. I cycle to the Franciscan church to pray for Theresa. St. Francis, would you please talk to God. Tell Him it wasn't Theresa's fault. I could have refused that telegram Saturday after Saturday. Tell God Theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because that's what the consumption does to you. It doesn't matter anyway, St. Francis, because I love Theresa. I love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell God take the consumption away and I promise I'll never go near her again.
The next Saturday they give me the Carmody telegram. From halfway up the street I can see the blinds are drawn. I can see the black crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all because of me.
I slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa's soul. I pray to every statue, to the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross. I swear I'll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience.
Next day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody.
On Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody weeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled. The priest recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water.
I want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell them how I'm the one who sent Theresa to hell. They can do whatever they like with me. Abuse me. Revile me. Throw grave dirt at me. But I stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave.
Frost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again.
It's getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have telegrams to deliver.
XVI
Mrs. O'Connell gives me telegrams to deliver to Mr. Harrington, the Englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in Limerick. The boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they're excused from the tip. They'll ask you if you'd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed. That wouldn't be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich. Oh, no, they're happy to get your prayer but you're only a telegram boy and you're lucky if you get a
dry biscuit. Older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip. If you're asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse, give a powerful sigh, bless yourself, drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they won't see your face, let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed with your two hands as if they're going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams, make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on, and if you don't get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief.
This isn't my first time delivering telegrams to the Harrington house. Mr. Harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and Mrs. Harrington is generous with the tip. But she's gone and Mr. Harrington answers the doorbell. His eyes are red and he sniffles. He says, Are you Irish?
Irish? What else would I be standing there on his doorstep in Limerick with a batch of telegrams in my hand? I am, sir. He says, Come in. Put the telegrams on the hall stand. He shuts the hall door, locks it, puts the key in his pocket and I think, Aren't Englishmen very peculiar.
You'll want to see her, of course. You'll want to see what you people have done to her with your damn tuberculosis. Race of ghouls. Follow me.
He leads me first to the kitchen where he picks up a plate of ham sandwiches and two bottles, and then upstairs. Mrs. Harrington looks lovely in the bed, blond, pink, peaceful.
This is my wife. She may be Irish but she doesn't look it, thank God. Like you. Irish. You'll need a drink, of course. You Irish quaff at every turn. Barely weaned before you clamor for the whiskey bottle, the pint of stout. You'll have what, whiskey, sherry?
Ah, a lemonade will be lovely.
I am mourning my wife not celebrating the bloody citrus. You'll have a sherry. Swill from bloody Catholic fascist Spain.
I gulp the sherry. He refills my glass and goes to refill his own with whiskey. Damn. Whiskey all gone. Stay here. Do you hear me? I'm going to the pub for another bottle of whiskey. Stay till I come back. Don't move.
I'm confused, dizzy from the sherry. I don't know what you're supposed to do with grieving Englishmen. Mrs. Harrington, you look lovely in the bed. But you're a Protestant, already doomed, in hell, like Theresa. Priest said, Outside the Church there is no salvation. Wait, I might be able to save your soul. Baptize you Catholic. Make up for what I did to Theresa. I'll get some water. Oh, God, the door is locked. Why? Maybe you're not dead at all? Watching me. Are you dead, Mrs. Harrington? I'm not afraid. Your face is icy. Oh, you're dead all right. I'll baptize you with sherry from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, the- What the bloody hell are you doing? Get off my wife, you wretched Papist twit. What primitive Paddy ritual is this? Did you touch her? Did you? I'll wring your scrawny neck.
I - I, -
Oi, Oi, speak English, you scrap.
I was just, a little sherry to get her into heaven.
Heaven? We had heaven, Ann, I, our daughter, Emily. You'll never lay your pink piggy eyes on her. Oh, Christ, I can't stand it. Here, more sherry.
Ah, no, thanks.
Ah, no thanks. That puny Celtic whine. You people love your alcohol. Helps you crawl and whine better. Of course you want food. You have the collapsed look of a starving Paddy. Here. Ham. Eat.
Ah, no thanks.
Ah, no thanks. Say that again and I'll ram the ham up your arse. He waves a ham sandwich at me, with the heel of his hand pushes it
into my mouth.
He collapses into a chair. Oh, God, God, what am I to do? Must rest
a moment.
My stomach heaves. I rush to the window, stick my head out and
throw up. He leaps from the chair and charges me.
You, you, God blast you to hell, you vomited on my wife's rosebush. He lunges at me, misses, falls to the floor. I climb out the
window, hang on to the ledge. He's at the window, grabbing at my hands. I let go, drop to the rosebush, into the ham sandwich and sherry I've just thrown up. I'm pricked by rose thorns, stung, my ankle is twisted. He's at the window, barking, Come back here, you Irish runt. He'll report me to the post office. He hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle, pleads, Will you not watch one hour with me?
He pelts me with sherry glasses, whiskey glasses, assorted ham sandwiches, items from his wife's dressing table, powders, creams, brushes.
I climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of Limerick, dizzy with sherry and pain. Mrs. O'Connell attacks me, Seven telegrams, one address, and you're gone all day.
I was, I was,
You was. You was. Drunk is what you was. Drunk is what you are. Reeking. Oh, we heard. That nice man rang, Mr. Harrington, lovely Englishman that sounds like James Mason. Lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing you're out the window with the sherry and the ham. Your poor mother. What she brought into the world.
He made me eat the ham, drink the sherry.
Made you? Jesus, that's a good one. Made you. Mr. Harrington is a refined Englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we don't want your kind in this post office, people that can't keep their hands off the ham and sherry, so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office.
But I need the job. I have to save and go to America.
America. Sad day when America lets in the likes of you.
I hobble through the streets of Limerick. I'd like to go back and
throw a brick through Mr. Harrington's window. No. Respect for the dead. I'll go across the Sarsfield Bridge and out the riverbank where I can lie down somewhere in the bushes. I don't know how I can go home and tell my mother I lost my job. Have to go home. Have to tell her. Can't stay out the riverbank all night. She'd be frantic.
Mam begs the post office to take me back. They say no. They never heard the likes. Telegram boy mauling corpse. Telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry. He will never set foot in the post office again. No.
She gets a letter from the parish priest. Take the boy back, says the parish priest. Oh, yes, Father, indeed, says the post office. They'll
let me stay till my sixteenth birthday, not a minute longer. Besides, says Mrs. O'Connell, when you think of what the English did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry. Compare a little ham and sherry to the Great Famine and where are you? If my poor husband was alive and I told him what you did he'd say you struck a blow, Frank McCourt, struck a blow.
Every Saturday morning I swear I'll go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home, on lonely boreens around Limerick with cows and sheep gawking, on the heights of Carrigogunnell with the world looking up.
I'll tell him about Theresa Carmody and how I sent her to hell, and that will be the end of me, driven from the Church.
Theresa is a torment to me. Every time I deliver a telegram to her street, every time I pass the graveyard I feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if I don't go to confession soon I'll be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other, There he is, there's Frankie McCourt, the dirty thing that sent Theresa Carmody to hell.
I look at people going to Communion on Sundays, everyone in a state of grace, returning to their seats with God in their mouths, peaceful, easy, ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world.
I'm worn out from being the worst sinner in Limerick. I want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt, no torment. I want to be ordinary.
The priests tell us all the time that God's mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption.
I cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him to help me but I think he's too disgusted with me. I kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can't breathe, my heart pounds, my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run from the church.
I swear I'll go to confession at Christmas. I can't. Easter. I can't. Weeks and months pass and it's a year since Theresa died. I'll go on her anniversary but I can't. I'm fifteen now and I pass churches without stopping. I'll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests like Bing Crosby in Going My Way who won't kick me out of the confessional like Limerick priests.
I still have the sin in me, the abscess, and I hope it doesn't kill me entirely before I see the American priest.
There's a telegram for an old woman, Mrs. Brigid Finucane. She says, How old are you, by?
Fifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane.
Young enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better. Are you shmart, by? Are you anyway intelligent?
I can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.
Arrah, there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write. Can you write a letter?
I can.
She wants me to write letters to her customers. If you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her. She gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes. She gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top. You pay her back weekly. Some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters. She says, I'll give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment. If you want the job come here on Thursday and Friday nights, and bring your own paper and envelopes.
I'm desperate for that job. I want to go to America. But I have no money for paper and envelopes. Next day I'm delivering a telegram to Woolworth's and there is the answer, a whole section packed with paper and envelopes. I have no money so I have to help myself. But how? Two dogs save the day for me, two dogs at the door of Woolworth's stuck together after the excitement. They yelp and run in circles. Customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while they're busy pretending I slip paper and envelopes under my sweater, out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs.
Mrs. Finucane looks suspicious. That's very fancy stationery you have there, by. Is that your mother's? You'll give that back when you get the money, won't you, by?
Oh, I will.
From now on I'm never to come to her front door. There's a lane behind her house and I'm to come in the back door for fear someone might see me.
In a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments. Threaten 'em, by. Frighten the life out of 'em.
My first letter,
Dear Mrs. O'Brien,
Inasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action. There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together. I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family.
I remain, yours in litigious anticipation, Mrs. Brigid Finucane She tells me, That's a powerful letter, by, better than anything you'd read in the Limerick Leader. That word, inasmuch, that's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean?
I think it means this is your last chance.
I write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps. On my way to the post office I think, Why should I squander money on stamps when I have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night? When you're poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door.
I run through the lanes of Limerick shoving letters under doors, praying no one will see me.
The next week Mrs. Finucane is squealing with joy. Four of 'em paid. Oh, sit down now and write more, by. Put the fear of God in 'em.
Week after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper. I begin to throw in words I hardly understand myself.
Dear Mrs. O'Brien,
Inasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in Dublin.
Next week Mrs. O'Brien pays. She came in tremblin' with tears in her eyes, by, and she promised she'd never miss another payment.
On Friday nights Mrs. Finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry. You're too young for sherry, by. You can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning. No, you can't have a piece of bread with the prices they're charging. Bread is it? Next thing you'll be asking for an egg.
She rocks by the fire, sipping her sherry, counting the money in the purse on her lap, entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs. After a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the Church for Masses to be said for the repose of your soul. It makes her so happy to think of priests saying Masses for her years and years after she's dead and buried.
Sometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor I help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words. There will be less money for the priests and their Masses but how many Masses does a soul need and surely I'm entitled to a few pounds after the way the Church slammed doors in my face? They wouldn't let me be an altar boy, a secondary school pupil, a missionary with the White Fathers. I don't care. I have a post office savings account and if I keep writing successful threatening letters, helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money, I'll have my escape money to America. If my whole family dropped from the hunger I wouldn't touch this money in the post office.
Often I have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and I worry they might discover me. They complain to Mam, That oul' bitch, Finucane, below in Irishtown, sent me a threatening letter. What kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that I can't make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea. The person that would write that letter is worse than Judas or any informer for the English.
My mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people.
I'm sorry for their troubles but there's no other way for me to save the money for America. I know that someday I'll be a rich Yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again.

Some of the temporary telegram boys are taking the permanent exam in August. Mrs. O'Connell says, You should take that exam, Frank McCourt. You have a bit of a brain in your head and you'd pass it no bother. You'd be a postman in no time and a great help to your poor mother.
Mam says I should take it, too, become a postman, save up, go to America and be a postman over there and wouldn't that be a lovely life.
I'm delivering a telegram to South's pub on a Saturday and Uncle Pa Keating is sitting there, all black as usual. He says, Have a lemonade there, Frankie, or is it a pint you want now that you're near sixteen?
Lemonade, Uncle Pa, thanks.
You'll want your first pint the day you're sixteen, won't you? I will but my father won't be here to get it for me.
Don't worry about that. I know 'tis not the same without your
father but I'll get you the first pint. 'Tis what I'd do if I had a son. Come here the night before you're sixteen.
I will, Uncle Pa.
I hear you're taking that exam for the post office?
I am.
Why would you do a thing like that? 'Tis a good job and I'd be a
postman in no time and it has the pension.
Ah, pension my arse. Sixteen years of age an' talking about the
pension. Is it coddin' me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension my arse. If you pass the exam you'll stay in the post office nice and secure the rest of your life. You'll marry a Brigid and have five little Catholics and grow little roses in your garden. You'll be dead in your head before you're thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt?
I do, Uncle Pa. That's what Mr. O'Halloran said.
What did he say?
Make up your own mind.
True for Mr. O'Halloran. 'Tis your life, make your own decisions
and to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o' the hunt you'll be going to America anyway, won't you?
I will, Uncle Pa.
The day of the exam I'm excused from work. There's a sign in an office window on O'Connell Street, SMART BOY WANTED, NEAT HANDWRITING, GOOD AT SUMS, APPLY HERE TO MANAGER, MR. MCCAFFREY, EASONS LTD.
I stand outside the place of the exam, the house of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association. There are boys from all over Limerick climbing the steps to take the exam and a man at the door is handing them sheets of paper and pencils and barking at them to hurry up, hurry up. I look at the man at the door, I think of Uncle Pa Keating and what he said, I think of the sign in Easons' office, SMART BOY WANTED. I don't want to go in that door and pass that exam for if I do I'll be a permanent telegram boy with a uniform, then a postman, then a clerk selling stamps for the rest of my life. I'll be in Limerick forever, growing roses with my head dead and my ballocks all dried up.
The man at the door says, You, are you coming in here or are you goin' to stand there with your face hanging out?
I want to say to the man, Kiss my arse, but I still have a few weeks left in the post office and he might report me. I shake my head and walk up the street where a smart boy is wanted.
The manager, Mr. McCaffrey, says, I would like to see a specimen of your handwriting, to see, in short, if you have a decent fist. Sit down there at that table. Write your name and address and write me a paragraph explaining why you came here for this job and how you propose to rise in the ranks of Eason and Son, Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assiduity where there is great opportunity in this company for a boy that will keep his eye on the guidon ahead and guard his flanks from the siren call of sin.
I write,
Frank McCourt,
4 Little Barrington Street,
Limerick City,
County Limerick,
Ireland
I am applying for this job so that I can rise to the highest ranks of Easons Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assadooty knowing that if I keep my eyes ahead and protect my flanks I'll be safe from all temptation and a credit to Easons and Ireland in general.
What's this? says Mr. McCaffrey. Do we have here a twisting of the truth?
I don't know, Mr. McCaffrey.
Little Barrington Street. That's a lane. Why are you calling it a street? You live in a lane, not a street.
They call it a street, Mr. McCaffrey.
Don't be getting above yourself, boy.
Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.
You live in a lane and that means you have nowhere to go but up. Do
you understand that, McCourt?
I do, sir.
You have to work your way out of the lane, McCourt. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
You have the cut and jib of a lane boy, McCourt. Yes, Mr. McCaffrey.
You have the look of the lane all over you. All over you from poll to toe cap. Don't try to fool the populace, McCourt. You'd have to rise early in the morning to fool the likes of me.
Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.
Then there's the eyes. Very sore eyes you have there. Can you see? I can, Mr. McCaffrey.
You can read and write but can you do addition and subtraction?
I can, Mr. McCaffrey.
Well, I don't know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to
ring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is clear, McCourt. A good fist. We'll take you on pending the decision on the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station.
In the morning? In the morning. We don't give out the bloody morning papers at night, do we?
No, Mr. McCaffrey.
Another thing. We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run by the freemasons in Dublin. We pick it up at the railway station. We count it. We take it to the newsagents. But we don't read it. I don't want to see you reading it. You could lose the Faith and by the look of those eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me, McCourt?
I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
No IrishTimes, and when you come in next week I'll tell you about all the English filth you're not to read in this office. Do you hear me?
I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
Mrs. O'Connell has the tight mouth and she won't look at me. She says to Miss Barry, I hear a certain upstart from the lanes walked away from the post office exam. Too good for it, I suppose.
True for you, says Miss Barry.
Too good for us, I suppose.
True for you.
Do you think he'd ever tell us why he didn't take the exam?
Oh, he might, says Miss Barry, if we went down on our two knees. I tell her, I want to go to America, Mrs. O'Connell.
Did you hear that, Miss Barry?
I did, indeed, Mrs. O'Connell.
He spoke.
He did, indeed.
He will rue the day, Miss Barry.
Rue he will, Mrs. O'Connell.
Mrs. O'Connell talks past me to the boys waiting on the bench for
their telegrams, This is Frankie McCourt who thinks he's too good for the post office.
I don't think that, Mrs. O'Connell.
And who asked you to open your gob, Mr. High and Mighty? Too grand for us, isn't he, boys?
He is, Mrs. O'Connell.
And after all we did for him, giving him the telegrams with the good tips, sending him to the country on fine days, taking him back after his disgraceful behavior with Mr. Harrington, the Englishman, disrespecting the body of poor Mrs. Harrington, stuffing himself with ham sandwiches, getting fluthered drunk on sherry, jumping out the window and destroying every rosebush in sight, coming in here three sheets to the wind, and who knows what else he did delivering telegrams for two years, who knows indeed, though we have a good idea, don't we, Miss Barry?
We do, Mrs. O'Connell, though 'twouldn't be a fit subject to be talking about.
She whispers to Miss Barry and they look at me and shake their heads.
A disgrace he is to Ireland and his poor mother. I hope she never finds out. But what would you expect of one born in America and his father from the North. We put up with all that and still took him back.
She keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench.
Going to work for Easons he is, working for that pack of freemasons and Protestants above in Dublin. Too good for the post office but ready and willing to deliver all kinds of filthy English magazines all over Limerick. Every magazine he touches will be a mortal sin. But he's leaving now, so he is, and a sorry day it is for his poor mother that prayed for a son with a pension to take care of her in her latter days. So here, take your wages and go from the sight of us.
Miss Barry says, He's a bad boy, isn't he, boys?
He is, Miss Barry.
I don't know what to say. I don't know what I did wrong. Should I
say I'm sorry? Good-bye?
I lay my belt and pouch on Mrs. O'Connell's desk. She glares at me,
Go on. Go to your job at Easons. Go from us. Next boy, come up for your telegrams.
They're back at work and I'm down the stairs to the next part of my life.
XVII
I don't know why Mrs. O'Connell had to shame me before the whole world, and I don't think I'm too good for the post office or anything else. How could I with my hair sticking up, pimples dotting my face, my eyes red and oozing yellow, my teeth crumbling with the rot, no shoulders, no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in Limerick and regions beyond?
Mrs. O'Connell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy. She must know about the times I went at myself on top of Carrigogunnell, milkmaids gawking, little boys looking up.
She must know about Theresa Carmody and the green sofa, how I got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell, the worst sin of all, worse than Carrigogunnell a thousand times. She must know I never went to confession after Theresa, that I'm doomed to hell myself.
A person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else.
The barman at South's remembers me from the time I sat with Mr. Hannon, Bill Galvin, Uncle Pa Keating, black white black. He remembers my father, how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel.
And what is it you'd like? says the barman.
I'm here to meet Uncle Pa Keating and have my first pint.
Oh, begod, is that a fact? He'll be here in a minute and sure
there's no reason why I shouldn't draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint, is there now?
There isn't, sir.
Uncle Pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall. The barman brings the pints, Uncle Pa pays, lifts his glass, tells the men in the pub, This is my nephew, Frankie McCourt, son of Angela Sheehan, the sister of my wife, having his first pint, here's to your health and long life, Frankie, may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much.
The men lift their pints, nod, drink, and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches. I take a great gulp of my pint and Uncle Pa tells me, Slow down for the love o' Jasus, don't drink it all, there's more where that came from as long as the Guinness family stays strong and healthy.
I tell him I want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says, No, take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from America flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm.
The men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in God's name Hermann Goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging. The Yanks are over there in Nuremberg declaring they don't know how the Nazi bastard hid that pill. Was it in his ear? Up his nostril? Up his arse? Surely the Yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every Nazi they captured and still Hermann wiped their eye. There you are. It shows you can sail across the Atlantic, land in Normandy, bomb Germany off the face of the earth, but when all's said and done they can't find a little pill planted in the far reaches of Goering's fat arse.
Uncle Pa buys me another pint. It's harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge. The men are talking about
concentration camps and the poor Jews that never harmed a soul, men, women, children crammed into ovens, children, mind you, what harm could they do, little shoes scattered everywhere, crammed in, and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out. Uncle Pa says, Are you all right? You're as white as a sheet. He takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth. I can't go into the pub again, cigarette smoke, stale Guinness, Goering's fat arse, small shoes scattered, can't go in again, good night, Uncle Pa, thanks, and he tells me go straight home to my mother, straight home, oh, he doesn't know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if I died now I'd be in hell in a wink.
Uncle Pa goes back to his pint. I'm out on O'Connell Street and why shouldn't I take the few steps to the Jesuits and tell all my sins this last night I'll be fifteen. I ring the bell at the priests'house and a big man answers, Yes? I tell him, I want to go to confession, Father. He says, I'm not a priest. Don't call me father. I'm a brother.
All right, Brother. I want to go to confession before I'm sixteen tomorrow. State o' grace on my birthday.
He says, Go away. You're drunk. Child like you drunk as a lord ringing for a priest at this hour. Go away or I'll call the guards.
Ah, don't. Ah, don't. I only want to go to confession. I'm doomed. You're drunk and you're not in a proper spirit of repentance.
He closes the door in my face. Another door closed in the face, but
I'm sixteen tomorrow and I ring again. The brother opens the door, swings me around, kicks my arse and sends me tripping down the steps.
He says, Ring this bell again and I'll break your hand.
Jesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that. They're supposed to be like Our Lord, not walking the world threatening people's hands.
I'm dizzy. I'll go home to bed. I hold on to railings along Barrington Street and keep to the wall going down the lane. Mam is by the fire smoking a Woodbine, my brothers upstairs in the bed. She says, That's a nice state to come home in.
It's hard to talk but I tell her I had my first pint with Uncle Pa. No father to get me the first pint.
Your Uncle Pa should know better.
I stagger to a chair and she says, Just like your father. I try to control the way my tongue moves in my mouth. I'd rather be, I'd rather, rather be like my father than Laman Griffin.
She turns away from me and looks into the ashes in the range but I won't leave her alone because I had my pint, two pints, and I'm sixteen tomorrow, a man.
Did you hear me? I'd rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She stands up and faces me. Mind your tongue, she says.
Mind your own bloody tongue.
Don't talk to me like that. I'm your mother.
I'll talk to you any bloody way I like.
You have a mouth like a messenger boy.
Do I? Do I? Well, I'd rather be a messenger boy than the likes of
Laman Griffin oul' drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him.
She walks away from me and I follow her upstairs to the small room. She turns, Leave me alone, leave me alone, and I keep barking at her,
Laman Griffin, Laman Griffin, till she pushes me, Get out of this room, and I slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and there's a small whimpering sound from her, You'll never have the chance to do that again, and I back away from her because there's another sin on my long list and I'm ashamed of myself.
I fall into my bed, clothes and all, and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow, my brothers complaining of the stink, telling me clean up, I'm a disgrace. I hear my mother crying and I want to tell her I'm sorry but why should I after what she did with Laman Griffin.
In the morning my small brothers are gone to school, Malachy is out looking for a job, Mam is at the fire drinking tea. I place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go. She says, Do you want a cup of tea?
No.
'Tis your birthday.
I don't care.
She calls up the lane after me, You should have something in your
stomach, but I give her my back and turn the corner without answering. I still want to tell her I'm sorry but if I do I'll want to tell her she's the cause of it all, that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and I don't give a fiddler's fart anyway because I'm still writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and saving to go to America.
I have the whole day before I go to Mrs. Finucane to write the threatening letters and I wander down Henry Street till the rain drives me into the Franciscan church where St. Francis stands with his birds and lambs. I look at him and wonder why I ever prayed to him. No, I didn't pray, I begged.
I begged him to intercede for Theresa Carmody but he never did a thing, stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile, the birds, the lambs, and didn't give a fiddler's fart about Theresa or me.
I'm finished with you, St. Francis. Moving on. Francis. I don't know why they ever gave me that name. I'd be better off if they called me Malachy, one a king, the other a great saint. Why didn't you heal Theresa? Why did you let her go to hell? You let my mother climb to the loft. You let me get into a state of doom. Little children's shoes scattered in concentration camps. I have the abscess again. It's in my chest and I'm hungry.
St. Francis is no help, he won't stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes, the sniffling and choking and the God oh Gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and I'm so weak with the hunger and the crying I could fall on the floor and would you please help me God or St. Francis because I'm sixteen today and I hit my mother and sent Theresa to hell and wanked all over Limerick and the county beyond and I dread the millstone around my neck.
There is an arm around my shoulders, a brown robe, click of black rosary beads, a Franciscan priest.
My child, my child, my child.
I'm a child and I lean against him, little Frankie on his father's lap, tell me all about Cuchulain, Dad, my story that Malachy can't have or Freddie Leibowitz on the swings.
My child, sit here with me. Tell me what troubles you. Only if you want to. I am Father Gregory.
I'm sixteen today, Father.
Oh, lovely, lovely, and why should that be a trouble to you?
I drank my first pint last night.
Yes? I hit my mother.
God help us, my child. But He will forgive you. Is there anything
else?
I can't tell you, Father.
Would you like to go to confession?
I can't, Father. I did terrible things.
God forgives all who repent. He sent His only Beloved Son to die
for us.
I can't tell, Father. I can't.
But you could tell St. Francis, couldn't you?
He doesn't help me anymore.
But you love him, don't you?
I do. My name is Francis.
Then tell him. We'll sit here and you'll tell him the things that
trouble you. If I sit and listen it will only be a pair of ears for St. Francis and Our Lord. Won't that help?
I talk to St. Francis and tell him about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene, my father singing Roddy McCorley and bringing home no money, my father sending no money from England, Theresa and the green sofa, my terrible sins on Carrigogunnell, why couldn't they hang Hermann Goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps, the Christian Brother who closed the door in my face, the time they wouldn't let me be an altar boy, my small brother Michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking, my bad eyes that I'm ashamed of, the Jesuit brother who closed the door in my face, the tears in Mam's eyes when I slapped her.
Father Gregory says, Would you like to sit and be silent, perhaps pray a few minutes?
His brown robe is rough against my cheek and there's a smell of soap. He looks at St. Francis and the tabernacle and nods and I suppose he's talking to God. Then he tells me kneel, gives me absolution, tells me say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, three Glory Bes. He tells me God forgives me and I must forgive myself, that God loves me and I must love myself for only when you love God in yourself can you love all God's creatures.
But I want to know about Theresa Carmody in hell, Father.
No, my child. She is surely in heaven. She suffered like the martyrs in olden times and God knows that's penance enough. You can be sure the sisters in the hospital didn't let her die without a priest.
Are you sure, Father?
I am, my child.
He blesses me again, asks me to pray for him, and I'm happy
trotting through the rainy streets of Limerick knowing Theresa is in heaven with the cough gone.
Monday morning and it's dawn in the railway station. Newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall. Mr. McCaffrey is there with another boy, Willie Harold, cutting the twine on the bundles, counting, entering the count in a ledger. English newspapers and The Irish Times have to be delivered early, magazines later in the morning. We count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city.
Mr. McCaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while Willie and I run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day, add or drop in the ledger. After the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes.
When I return to the office there are two other boys, Eamon and Peter, already sorting magazines, counting and stuffing them into news agents' boxes along the wall. Small orders are delivered by Gerry Halvey on his messenger bicycle, big orders in the van. Mr. McCaffrey tells me stay in the office so that I can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger. The minute Mr. McCaffrey leaves Eamon and Peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up. They can't believe I don't smoke. They want to know if there's something wrong with me, the bad eyes or the consumption maybe. How can you go out with a girl if you don't smoke? Peter says, Wouldn't you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didn't smoke, wouldn't you be a right eejit then? How would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel? Eamon says, 'Tis what my father says about men who don't drink, they're not to be trusted. Peter says if you find a man that won't drink or smoke that's a man that's not even interested in girls and you'd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse, that's what you'd want to be doing.
They laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till they're holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks. When the fit passes we pick out English and American magazines and look at the advertisements for women's underwear, brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings. Eamon is looking at an American magazine called See with pictures of Japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and Eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does Peter gives me a wink, You know what he's up to in there, don't you? and sometimes Mr. McCaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which Easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger. Mr. McCaffrey won't come right out and say, Stop that wanking, because you can't accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof. Sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out. He comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys, Ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts. Ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and that's all.
Eamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an American magazine, Collier's, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. Eamon says, Do you know what he's doing in there? At himself. Five times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in with the women's underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide.
I'd like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I don't want them saying, There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, already at himself. Won't light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul' billygoat.
Mr. McCaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines aren't counted out, bundled and ready to go. Peter tells him, We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he was a
bit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now he's getting faster.
Gerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won't be in for a week because he's entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend, Rose, who's coming back from England. I'm the new boy and I have to be messenger boy while he's gone, cycling around Limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won't tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and that's what he looked like, salmon.
Gerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that's handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train. We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn't seen Rose in a year. She's over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn't like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He'll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that's different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are.
The train hoots into the station and Gerry waves and points to Rose coming toward us from the far end of the train, Rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress. Gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath, Look at the walk on her, bitch, hoor, street walker, flaghopper, trollop, and runs from the station. Rose walks up to me, Was that Gerry Halvey you were standing with?
'Twas.
Where is he?
Oh, he went out.
I know he went out. Where did he go?
I don't know. He didn't tell me. He just ran out.
Didn't say anything?
I didn't hear him say anything.
Do you work with him?
I do. I'm taking over the bike.
What bike?
The messenger bike.
Is he on a messenger bike?
He is.
He told me he worked in Easons office, clerk, inside job?
I feel desperate. I don't want to make a liar of Gerry Halvey, to
get him into trouble with the lovely Rose. Oh, we all take turns on the messenger bike. An hour in the office, an hour on the bike. The manager says 'tis good to get out in the fresh air.
Well, I'll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his house. I thought he'd carry this for me.
I have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I'll walk you home.
We walk up to her house in Carey's Road and she tells me she's so excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she wants to go back with him and get married even if he's only nineteen and she's only seventeen. What matter when you're in love. I lived like a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very much for carrying my case.
I turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he's snorting like a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh? What? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I'll kill you.
I didn't do anything. Carried her case because 'twas heavy. Don't look at her again or you're dead.
I won't, Gerry. I don't want to look at her.
Oh, is that a fact? Is she ugly or what?
No, no, Gerry, she's yours and she loves you. How do you know?
She told me.
She did?
She did, honest to God.
Jasus.
He bangs on her door, Rose, Rose, are you there? and she comes out,
Of course, I'm here, and I ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says Easons wondering about the way he's kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how Peter in the office could tell Mr. McCaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and Eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory.
Mr. McCaffrey is in a terrible state in the office. Where were you? Great God above in heaven, does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station? We have an emergency here and we should have Halvey but he's gone off on his friggin' holidays, God forgive the language, and you'll have to cycle around as fast as you can, good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of Limerick, and go to every bloody shop that's a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of John O'London's Weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them 'tis government orders and they're not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you they're liable to arrest, imprisonment and a large fine now go for God's sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire.
Every shop, Mr. McCaffrey?
I'll do the big ones, you do the small ones all the way to Ballinacurra and out the Ennis Road and beyond, God help us. Go on, go.
I'm jumping on the bike and Eamon runs down the steps. Hey, McCourt, wait. Listen. Don't give him all the page sixteens when you come back.
Why?
We can sell 'em, me an' Peter.
Why?
'Tis all about birth control and that's banned in Ireland.
What's birth control?
Aw, Christ above, don't you know anything? 'Tis condoms, you know,
rubbers, French letters, things like that to stop the girls from getting up the pole.
Up the pole?
Pregnant. Sixteen years of age an' you're pure ignorant. Hurry up an' get the pages before everybody starts runnin' to the shop for John O'London's Weekly.
I'm about to push away on the bike when Mr. McCaffrey runs down the steps. Hold on, McCourt, we'll go in the van. Eamon, you come with us.
What about Peter?
Leave him. He'll wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway. Mr. McCaffrey talks to himself in the van. Nice bloody how do you
do ringing down here from Dublin on a fine Saturday to send us tearing around Limerick ripping pages out of an English magazine when I could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely.
Mr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I'll call the guards.
Mr. McCaffrey tells them, Government orders, ma'am. There is filth in John O'London this week that's not fit for any Irish eyes and we are here to do God's work. What filth?
What filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin' the magazines. I won't pay Easons for these magazines, so I won't.
Ma'am, we don't care at Easons. We'd rather lose large amounts than have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth.
What filth?
Can't tell you. Come on, boys.
We throw the pages on the floor of the van and when Mr. McCaffrey
is in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts. There are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that Mr. McCaffrey will think they're all page sixteen from John O'London.
The biggest customer for the magazine, Mr. Hutchinson, tells Mr. McCaffrey get to hell out of his shop or he'll brain him, get away from them magazines, and when Mr. McCaffrey keeps on tearing out pages Mr. Hutchinson throws him into the street, Mr. McCaffrey yelling that this is a Catholic country and just because Hutchinson is a Protestant that doesn't give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in Ireland. Mr. Hutchinson says, Ah, kiss my arse, and Mr. McCaffrey says, See, boys? See what happens when you're not a member of the True Church?
Some shops says they've already sold all their copies of John O'London and Mr. McCaffrey says, Oh, Mother o'God, what's going to become of us all? Who did ye sell them to?
He demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say, 'Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself.
On the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell him fourteen but I have over forty and I'm not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van. We scoop up everything on the floor and he's happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through
shops like God's avenger and saved Limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with John O'London's Weekly.
Monday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there's any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O'London's Weekly. They're all rich looking people, some in motor cars, men with hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control.
Eamon told me early in the day, Don't sell the bloody page for less than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn't. Everyone in Limerick is talking about this page and they're dying to get their hands on it.
Five shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they're rich charge more but that's what I'm charging so don't be going around on your bicycle and puttin' me out of business with low prices. We have to give Peter something or he'll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans.
Some people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I'm rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She's not happy I'm a messenger boy because that's the lowest you can drop in Limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She doesn't know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and she'd die if she knew what I was earning from writing threatening letters.
Malachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and Mam herself is taking care of an old man, Mr. Sliney, out in the South Circular Road while his two daughters go off to work every day. She tells me if I'm delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich. The daughters will never know and the old man won't mind because he's only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the English army in India.
She looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron, everything clean and polished around her, flowers bobbing in the garden beyond, birds chirping away, music from Radio Eireann on the wireless. She sits at the table with a pot of tea, cups and saucers, plenty of bread, butter, cold meats of all kinds. I can have any class of a sandwich but all I know is ham and brawn. She doesn't have any brawn because that's the kind of thing you'd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the South Circular Road. She says the rich won't eat brawn because it's what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what you're getting. The rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread. Over in America brawn is called head cheese and she doesn't know why.
She gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and I wonder why they can't make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen. Mam says that's the way the rich are, they love
the bit of decoration and wouldn't we if we had the money. She'd give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely Warsaw Concerto or the Dream of Olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows.
She says she has to look in on Mr. Sliney he's so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot.
Chamber pot? You have to empty his chamber pot?
Of course I do. There's a silence here because I think we're remembering the cause of all our troubles, Laman Griffin's chamber pot. But that was a long time ago and now it's Mr. Sliney's chamber pot, which is no harm because she's paid for this and he's harmless. When she comes back she tells me Mr. Sliney would like to see me, so come in while he's awake.
He's lying in a bed in the front parlor, the window blocked with a black sheet, no sign of light. He tells my mother, Lift me up a bit, missus, and pull back that bloody thing off the window so I can see the boy. He has long white hair down to his shoulders. Mam whispers he won't let anyone cut it. He says, I have me own teeth, son. Would you credit that? Do you have your own teeth, son?
I do, Mr. Sliney.
Ah. I was in India you know. Me and Timoney up the road. Bunch of Limerick men in India. Do you know Timoney, son?
I did, Mr. Sliney.
He's dead, you know. Poor bugger went blind. I have me sight. I have me teeth. Keep your teeth, son.
I will, Mr. Sliney.
I'm getting tired, son, but there's one thing I want to tell you. Are you listening to me?
I am, Mr. Sliney.
Is he listening to me, missus?
Oh, he is, Mr. Sliney.
Good. Now here's what I want to tell you. Lean over here so I can
whisper in your ear. What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe.
***
Halvey goes off to England with Rose and I have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter. It's a bitter winter, ice everywhere, and I never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement, magazines and papers scattered. Shops complain to Mr. McCaffrey that The Irish Times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us that's the way that paper should be delivered, Protestant rag that it is.
Every day after my deliveries I take The Irish Times home and read it to see where the danger is. Mam says it's a good thing Dad isn't here. He'd say, Is this what the men of Ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper?
There are letters to the editor from people all over Ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars. There are reports about Protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes. You can see Protestant women have perfect teeth although Halvey's Rose had lovely teeth.
I keep reading The Irish Times and wondering if it's an occasion of sin though I don't care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not
coughing I don't go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and TheTimes of London because that tells me what the King is up to every day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing.
I read English women's magazines for all the food articles and the answers to women's questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents and pretend they're reading from English women's magazines.
Peter says, Dear Miss Hope, I'm going out with a fellow from Ireland named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and I'm demented not knowing what to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith, Yorkshire.
Eamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he's pushing his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs. Surely you can find a decent short man in Yorkshire.
Dear Miss Hope, I am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and I can't tell anyone not even my mother. I'm bleeding every few weeks you know where and I'm afraid I'll be found out. Miss Agnes Tripple, Little Biddle-on-the-Twiddle, Devon.
Dear Agnes, You are to be congratulated. You are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies. Do not fear your monthlies for all Englishwomen have them. They are a gift of God to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire, soldiers to keep the Irish in their place. In some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we British cherish our women with the monthlies, oh we do indeed.
In the springtime there's a new messenger boy and I'm back in the office. Peter and Eamon drift off to England. Peter is fed up with Limerick, no girls, and you're driven to yourself, wank wank wank, that's all we ever do in Limerick. There are new boys. I'm senior boy and the job is easier because I'm fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and papers. Day and night I dream of America.
Malachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys' boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he's the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English boarding school you're supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper Irish servant. They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that's the kind of foul language and behavior you'd expect. He gets a job in the gas works in Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me.
XVIII
I'm seventeen, eighteen, going on nineteen, working away at Easons, writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane, who says she's not long for this world and the more Masses said for her soul the better she'll feel. She puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests' doors, hand in the envelopes with the request for Masses. She wants prayers from all the priests but the Jesuits. She says, They're useless, all head and no heart. That's what they should
have over their door in Latin and I won't give them a penny because every penny you give a Jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine.
She sends the money, she hopes the Masses are said, but she's never sure and if she's not sure why should I be handing out all that money to priests when I need the money to go to America and if I keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if I say a prayer for Mrs. Finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies won't God listen even if I'm a sinner long past my last confession.
I'll be nineteen in a month. All I need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when I land in America.
The Friday night before my nineteenth birthday Mrs. Finucane sends me for the sherry. When I return she is dead in the chair, her eyes wide open, and her purse on the floor wide open. I can't look at her but I help myself to a roll of money. Seventeen pounds. I take the key to the trunk upstairs. I take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger. I'll add this to what I have in the post office and I have enough to go to America. On my way out I take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted.
I sit by the River Shannon near the dry docks sipping Mrs. Finucane's sherry. Aunt Aggie's name is in the ledger. She owes nine pounds. It might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now she'll never have to pay it because I heave the ledger into the river. I'm sorry I'll never be able to tell Aunt Aggie I saved her nine pounds. I'm sorry I wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of Limerick, my own people, but the ledger is gone, no one will ever know what they owe and they won't have to pay their balances. I wish I could tell them, I'm your Robin Hood.
Another sip of the sherry. I'll spare a pound or two for a Mass for Mrs. Finucane's soul. Her ledger is well on its way down the Shannon and out to the Atlantic and I know I'll follow it someday soon.
The man at O'Riordan's Travel Agency says he can't get me to America by air unless I travel to London first, which would cost a fortune. He can put me on a ship called the Irish Oak, which will be leaving Cork in a few weeks. He says, Nine days at sea, September October, best time of the year, your own cabin, thirteen passengers, best of food, bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fifty-five pounds, do you have it?
I do.
I tell Mam I'm going in a few weeks and she cries. Michael says, Will we all go some day?
We will.
Alphie says, Will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you?
Michael tells him that's a boomerang and you'd have to go all the way to Australia to get the likes of that, you can't get it in America.
Alphie says you can get it in America yes you can and they argue about America and Australia and boomerangs till Mam says, For the love o' Jesus, yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs. Will ye give over?
Mam says we'll have to have a bit of party the night before I go. They used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to America, which was so far away the parties were called American wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this
life. She says 'tis a great pity Malachy can't come back from England but we'll be together in America someday with the help of God and His Blessed Mother.
On my days off from work I walk around Limerick and look at all the places we lived, the Windmill Street, Hartstonge Street, Roden Lane, Rosbrien Road, Little Barrington Street, which is really a lane. I stand looking at Theresa Carmody's house till her mother comes out and says, What do you want? I sit at the graves of Oliver and Eugene in the old St. Patrick's Burying Ground and cross the road to St. Lawrence's Cemetery where Theresa is buried. Wherever I go I hear voices of the dead and I wonder if they can follow you across the Atlantic Ocean.
I want to get pictures of Limerick stuck in my head in case I never come back. I sit in St. Joseph's Church and the Redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because I might never see this again. I walk down Henry Street to say good-bye to St. Francis though I'm sure I'll be able to talk to him in America.
Now there are days I don't want to go to America. I'd like to go to O'Riordan's Travel Agency and get back my fifty-five pounds. I could wait till I'm twenty-one and Malachy can go with me so that I'll know at least one person in New York. I have strange feelings and sometimes when I'm sitting by the fire with Mam and my brothers I feel tears coming and I'm ashamed of myself for being weak. At first Mam laughs and tells me, Your bladder must be near your eye, but then Michael says, We'll all go to America, Dad will be there, Malachy will be there and we'll all be together, and she gets the tears herself and we sit there, the four of us, like weeping eejits.
Mam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isn't it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one, Malachy to England, Frank to America. She saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of Mr. Sliney to buy bread, ham, brawn, cheese, lemonade and a few bottles of stout. Uncle Pa Keating brings stout, whiskey and a little sherry for Aunt Aggie's delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself. The Abbot brings six bottles of stout and says, That's all right, Frankie, ye can all drink it as long as I have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song.
He sings ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He holds his stout, closes his eyes, and song comes out in a high whine. The words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes. Alphie whispers to me, Why is he crying over a song that makes no sense?
I don't know.
The Abbot ends his song, opens his eyes, wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an Irish boy that went to America and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me don't be gettin' shot if you're not near a priest.
Uncle Pa says that's the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, Ah, no, Pa, sure I don't have the wind.
Come on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one voice
only.
All right. I'll try.
We all join in the chorus of her sad song,
A mother's love is a blessing No matter where you roam. Keep her while you have her,
You'll miss her when she's gone.
Uncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness.
Oh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot. The moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute.
We stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow. Uncle Pa says, That's a very good sign for you going to America, Frankie.
No, says Aunt Aggie, 'tis a bad sign. I read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world.
Oh, end of the world my arse, says Uncle Pa. 'Tis the beginning for Frankie McCourt. He'll come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any Yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin' from his arm.
Mam says, Ah, no, Pa, ah, no, and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from Spain.
It's late in the day when the Irish Oak sails from Cork, past Kinsale and Cape Clear, and dark when lights twinkle on Mizen Head, the last of Ireland I'll see for God knows how long.
Surely I should have stayed, taken the post office examination, climbed in the world. I could have brought in enough money for Michael and Alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled. We could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens. I should have taken that examination and Mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of Mr. Sliney or anyone else.
It's too late now. I'm on the ship and there goes Ireland into the night and it's foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and Limerick and Malachy and my father in England and even more foolish that songs are going through my head Roddy McCorley goes to die and Mam gasping Oh the days of the Kerry dancing with poor Mr. Clohessy hacking away in the bed and now I want Ireland back at least I had Mam and my brothers and Aunt Aggie bad as she was and Uncle Pa, standing me my first pint, and my bladder is near my eye and here's a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see he's curious.
He's a Limerickman but he has an American accent from his years in Los Angeles. He knows how it is to leave Ireland, did it himself and never got over it. You live in Los Angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask God if there's any chance He could give you one soft rainy Limerick day.
The priest sits beside me at the table of the First Officer, who tells us ship's orders have been changed and instead of sailing to New York we're bound for Montreal.
Three days out and orders are changed again. We are going to New York after all.
Three American passengers complain, Goddam Irish. Can't they get it straight?
The day before we sail into New York orders are changed again. We are going to a place up the Hudson River called Albany.
The Americans say, Albany? Goddam Albany? Why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam Irish tub? Goddam.
The priest tells me pay no attention. All Americans are not like that.
I'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. The priest wants to point out things but he doesn't have to. I can pick out the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.
The Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat. Why can't we get off here? Why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany?
The man says, Because you're passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore.
Oh, yeah. Well, this is a free country and we're American citizens.
Is that a fact? Well, you're on an Irish ship with an Irish captain and you'll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore.
He climbs down the ladder, tugboat chugs away, and we sail up the Hudson past Manhattan, under the George Washington Bridge, past hundreds of Liberty ships that did their bit in the war, moored now and ready to rot.
The captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called, the priest spells it for me, Poughkeepsie. The priest says that's an Indian name and the Americans say goddam Poughkeepsie.
After dark a small boat put-puts to the ship and an Irish voice calls up, Hello, there. Bejasus, I saw the Irish flag, so I did. Couldn't believe me two eyes. Hello, there.
He invites the First Officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and, You, too, Father. Bring a friend.
The priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer. The man in the boat says his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at the right time because there's a bit of a party and we're all invited. He takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg. There are five women in a room called a living room. The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their hands and they're friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says, Come right in. Just in time for the pawty.
Pawty. That's the way they talk and I suppose I'll be talking like that in a few years.
Tim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, Yeah. Buddies from the war. That war is over nearly five years and they can't get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold till they can't see. Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder.
The priest whispers to me, These are bad women. We won't stay here long.
The bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. What's your name, honey?
Frank McCourt.
Nice name. So you take a little drink. All the Irish take a little drink. You like a beer?
Yes, please. Gee, so polite. I like the Irish. My grandmother was half Irish so that makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here's your beer, honey.
The priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he'd like to see the house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don't have houses like this in Ireland. Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what they have growing in the garden, you wouldn't believe the flowers. Frieda asks me if I'm okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is.
The what?
Lavatory.
Oh, you mean the bathroom. Right this way, honey, down the hall. Thanks.
She pushes in the door, turns on the light, kisses my cheek and
whispers she'll be right outside if I need anything.
I stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what I'd need at
a time like this and if this is a common thing in America, women waiting outside while you take a splash.
I finish, flush and go outside. She takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom, puts down her glass, locks the door, pushes me down on the bed. She's fumbling at my fly. Damn buttons. Don't you have zippers in Ireland? She pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down Jesus I'm in heaven and there's a knock on the door the priest Frank are you in there Frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven Frank are you in there Father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh God oh Theresa do you see what's happening to me at long last I don't give a fiddler's fart if the Pope himself knocked on this door and the College of Cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh God the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me I'm wonderful and would I ever consider settling in Poughkeepsie.
Frieda tells the priest I had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom, that's what happens when you travel and you're drinking a strange beer like Rheingold, which she believes they don't have in Ireland. I can see the priest doesn't believe her and I can't stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face. He already wrote down my mother's name and address and now I'm afraid he'll write and say your fine son spent his first night in America in a bedroom in Poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for America in the war and isn't this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country.
The First Officer and the Wireless Officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they don't look at the priest. The women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen. We sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen. The priest whispers to me again, Bad women, bad women, occasion of sin, and I don't know what to say to him.
The bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you'd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest, so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets. Tim Boyle drinks whiskey and
falls asleep in a corner till Frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship. When we're leaving Frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in the night air.
We climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn't that a grand night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father.
We watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Pough- keepsie riverbank. The priest says good night and goes below and the First Officer follows him.
I stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights of America twinkling. He says, My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn't this a great country altogether?

Obojętnie, ile tysięcy ludzi, dziesiątek tysięcy czy setek mi te oklaski da
Musi to poczuć narcyz sam, że wciąż jest wyjątkowy
Jak perła, którą tylko niektóra z małży ma, ta

Wszystko inne wtedy zupełnie zbędne
Spoko, jak między Rasami, kiedy sprzedali dychę
Dopóki to nie pęka dzień w dzień
Bo wtedy to error jak u Natalii Nykiel
A tak było prawie dwa tygsy, hajsu plikiem

Old ManSawyer Fredericks,"So I broke my leg. Doesn’t matter how–since the accident I’ve heard plenty of broken-leg tales, and, I’m telling you, I didn’t realize that walking down the stairs, walking down hills, dancing in high heels, or stamping your foot on the brake pedal could be so dangerous. At any rate, like numerous broken-legged intellectuals before me, I found the prospect of three months in bed in the dining room rather seductive from a book-reading point of view, and I eagerly got started. Great novels piled up on my table, and right at the top was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which, I’m embarrassed to admit, I hadn’t read since junior high school. The novel took me a couple of days (it was longer than I had remembered), and I closed the cover stunned. Yes, stunned. Not, by any means, by the artistry of the book but by the notion that this is the novel all American literature grows out of, that this is a great novel, that this is even a serious novel.

Although Huck had his fans at publication, his real elevation into the pantheon was worked out early in the Propaganda Era, between 1948 and 1955, by Lionel Trilling, Leslie Fiedler, T. S. Eliot, Joseph Wood Krutch, and some lesser lights, in the introductions to American and British editions of the novel and in such journals as Partisan Review and The New York Times Book Review. The requirements of Huck’s installation rapidly revealed themselves: the failure of the last twelve chapters (in which Huck finds Jim imprisoned on the Phelps plantation and Tom Sawyer is reintroduced and elaborates a cruel and unnecessary scheme for Jim’s liberation) had to be diminished, accounted for, or forgiven; after that, the novel’s special qualities had to be placed in the context first of other American novels (to their detriment) and then of world literature. The best bets here seemed to be Twain’s style and the river setting, and the critics invested accordingly: Eliot, who had never read the novel as a boy, traded on his own childhood beside the big river, elevating Huck to the Boy, and the Mississippi to the River God, therein finding the sort of mythic resonance that he admired. Trilling liked the river god idea, too, though he didn’t bother to capitalize it. He also thought that Twain, through Huck’s lying, told truths, one of them being (I kid you not) that ""something ... had gone out of American life after the [Civil War], some simplicity, some innocence, some peace."" What Twain himself was proudest of in the novel–his style–Trilling was glad to dub ""not less than definitive in American literature. The prose of Huckleberry Finn established for written prose the virtues of American colloquial speech. . . . He is the master of the style that escapes the fixity of the printed page, that sounds in our ears with the immediacy of the heard voice, the very voice of unpretentious truth."" The last requirement was some quality that would link Huck to other, though ""lesser,"" American novels such as Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, that would possess some profound insight into the American character. Leslie Fiedler obligingly provided it when he read homoerotic attraction into the relationship between Huck and Jim, pointing out the similarity of this to such other white man-dark man friendships as those between Ishmael and Queequeg in Moby-Dick and Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook in James Fenimore Cooper’s Last of the Mohicans.

The canonization proceeded apace: great novel (Trilling, 1950), greatest novel (Eliot, 1950), world-class novel (Lauriat Lane Jr., 1955). Sensible naysayers, such as Leo Marx, were lost in the shuffle of propaganda. But, in fact, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has little to offer in the way of greatness. There is more to be learned about the American character from its canonization than through its canonization.

Let me hasten to point out that, like most others, I don’t hold any grudges against Huck himself. He’s just a boy trying to survive. The villain here is Mark Twain, who knew how to give Huck a voice but didn’t know how to give him a novel. Twain was clearly aware of the story’s difficulties. Not finished with having revisited his boyhood in Tom Sawyer, Twain conceived of a sequel and began composition while still working on Tom Sawyer’s page proofs. Four hundred pages into it, having just passed Cairo and exhausted most of his memories of Hannibal and the upper Mississippi, Twain put the manuscript aside for three years. He was facing a problem every novelist is familiar with: his original conception was beginning to conflict with the implications of the actual story. It is at this point in the story that Huck and Jim realize two things: they have become close friends, and they have missed the Ohio River and drifted into what for Jim must be the most frightening territory of all–down the river, the very place Miss Watson was going to sell him to begin with. Jim’s putative savior, Huck, has led him as far astray as a slave can go, and the farther they go, the worse it is going to be for him. Because the Ohio was not Twain’s territory, the fulfillment of Jim’s wish would necessarily lead the novel away from the artistic integrity that Twain certainly sensed his first four hundred pages possessed. He found himself writing not a boy’s novel, like Tom Sawyer, but a man’s novel, about real moral dilemmas and growth. The patina of nostalgia for a time and place, Missouri in the 1840s (not unlike former President Ronald Reagan’s nostalgia for his own boyhood, when ""Americans got along""), had been transformed into actual longing for a timeless place of friendship and freedom, safe and hidden, on the big river. But the raft had floated Huck and Jim, and their author with them, into the truly dark heart of the American soul and of American history: slave country.

Twain came back to the novel and worked on it twice again, once to rewrite the chapters containing the feud between the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, and later to introduce the Duke and the Dauphin. It is with the feud that the novel begins to fail, because from here on the episodes are mere distractions from the true subject of the work: Huck’s affection for and responsibility to Jim. The signs of this failure are everywhere, as Jim is pushed to the side of the narrative, hiding on the raft and confined to it, while Huck follows the Duke and the Dauphin onshore to the scenes of much simpler and much less philosophically taxing moral dilemmas, such as fraud. Twain was by nature an improviser, and he was pleased enough with these improvisations to continue. When the Duke and the Dauphin finally betray Jim by selling him for forty dollars, Huck is shocked, but the fact is neither he nor Twain has come up with a plan that would have saved Jim in the end. Tom Sawyer does that.

Considerable critical ink has flowed over the years in an attempt to integrate the Tom Sawyer chapters with the rest of the book, but it has flowed in vain. As Leo Marx points out, and as most readers sense intuitively, once Tom reappears, ""[m]ost of those traits which made [Huck] so appealing a hero now disappear. . . . It should be added at once that Jim doesn’t mind too much. The fact is that he has undergone a similar transformation. On the raft he was an individual, man enough to denounce Huck when Huck made him the victim of a practical joke. In the closing episode, however, we lose sight of Jim in the maze of farcical invention."" And the last twelve chapters are boring, a sure sign that an author has lost the battle between plot and theme and is just filling in the blanks.

As with all bad endings, the problem really lies at the beginning, and at the beginning of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn neither Huck nor Twain takes Jim’s desire for freedom at all seriously; that is, they do not accord it the respect that a man’s passion deserves. The sign of this is that not only do the two never cross the Mississippi to Illinois, a free state, but they hardly even consider it. In both Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, the Jackson’s Island scenes show that such a crossing, even in secret, is both possible and routine, and even though it would present legal difficulties for an escaped slave, these would certainly pose no more hardship than locating the mouth of the Ohio and then finding passage up it. It is true that there could have been slave catchers in pursuit (though the novel ostensibly takes place in the 1840s and the Fugitive Slave Act was not passed until 1850), but Twain’s moral failure, once Huck and Jim link up, is never even to account for their choice to go down the river rather than across it. What this reveals is that for all his lip service to real attachment between white boy and black man, Twain really saw Jim as no more than Huck’s sidekick, homoerotic or otherwise. All the claims that are routinely made for the book’s humanitarian power are, in the end, simply absurd. Jim is never autonomous, never has a vote, always finds his purposes subordinate to Huck’s, and, like every good sidekick, he never minds. He grows ever more passive and also more affectionate as Huck and the Duke and the Dauphin and Tom (and Twain) make ever more use of him for their own purposes. But this use they make of him is not supplementary; it is integral to Twain’s whole conception of the novel. Twain thinks that Huck’s affection is a good enough reward for Jim.

The sort of meretricious critical reasoning that has raised Huck’s paltry good intentions to a ""strategy of subversion"" (David L. Smith) and a ""convincing indictment of slavery"" (Eliot) precisely mirrors the same sort of meretricious reasoning that white people use to convince themselves that they are not ""racist."" If Huck feels positive toward Jim, and loves him, and thinks of him as a man, then that’s enough. He doesn’t actually have to act in accordance with his feelings. White Americans always think racism is a feeling, and they reject it or they embrace it. To most Americans, it seems more honorable and nicer to reject it, so they do, but they almost invariably fail to understand that how they feel means very little to black Americans, who understand racism as a way of structuring American culture, American politics, and the American economy. To invest The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with ""greatness"" is to underwrite a very simplistic and evasive theory of what racism is and to promulgate it, philosophically, in schools and the media as well as in academic journals. Surely the discomfort of many readers, black and white, and the censorship battles that have dogged Huck Finn in the last twenty years are understandable in this context. No matter how often the critics ""place in context"" Huck’s use of the word ""nigger,"" they can never excuse or fully hide the deeper racism of the novel–the way Twain and Huck use Jim because they really don’t care enough about his desire for freedom to let that desire change their plans. And to give credit to Huck suggests that the only racial insight Americans of the nineteenth or twentieth century are capable of is a recognition of the obvious–that blacks, slave and free, are human.

Ernest Hemingway, thinking of himself, as always, once said that all American literature grew out of Huck Finn. It undoubtedly would have been better for American literature, and American culture, if our literature had grown out of one of the best-selling novels of all time, another American work of the nineteenth century, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, which for its portrayal of an array of thoughtful, autonomous, and passionate black characters leaves Huck Finn far behind. Uncle Tom’s Cabin was published in 1852, when Twain was seventeen, still living in Hannibal and contributing to his brother’s newspapers, still sympathizing with the South, nine years before his abortive career in the Confederate Army. Uncle Tom’s Cabin was the most popular novel of its era, universally controversial. In 1863, when Harriet Beecher Stowe visited the White House, Abraham Lincoln condescended to remark to her, ""So this is the little lady who made this great war.""

The story, familiar to most nineteenth-century Americans, either through the novel or through the many stage adaptations that sentimentalized Stowe’s work, may be sketched briefly: A Kentucky slave, Tom, is sold to pay off a debt to a slave trader, who takes him to New Orleans. On the boat trip downriver, Tom is purchased by the wealthy Augustine St. Clare at the behest of his daughter, Eva. After Eva’s death, and then St. Clare’s, Tom is sold again, this time to Simon Legree, whose remote plantation is the site of every form of cruelty and degradation. The novel was immediately read and acclaimed by any number of excellent judges: Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, George Sand–the whole roster of nineteenth-century liberals whose work we read today and try to persuade ourselves that Huck Finn is equal to. English novelist and critic Charles Kingsley thought Uncle Tom’s Cabin the best novel ever written. These writers honored Stowe’s book for all its myriad virtues. One of these was her adept characterization of a whole world of whites and blacks who find themselves gripped by slavery, many of whose names have entered the American language as expressions–not only Uncle Tom himself but Simon Legree and, to a lesser extent, little Eva and the black child Topsy. The characters appear, one after another, vivified by their attitudes, desires, and opinions as much as by their histories and their fates. Surely Augustine St. Clare, Tom’s owner in New Orleans, is an exquisite portrayal of a humane but indecisive man, who knows what he is doing but not how to stop it. Surely Cassy, a fellow slave whom Tom meets on the Legree plantation, is one of the great angry women in all of literature–not only bitter, murderous, and nihilistic but also intelligent and enterprising. Surely the midlife spiritual journey of Ophelia St. Clare, Augustine’s Yankee cousin, from self-confident ignorance to affectionate understanding is most convincing, as is Topsy’s parallel journey from ignorance and self-hatred to humanity. The ineffectual Mr. Shelby and his submissive, and subversive, wife; the slave trader Haley; Tom’s wife, Chloe; Augustine’s wife, Marie; Legree’s overseers, Sambo and Quimbo–good or evil, they all live.

As for Tom himself, we all know what an ""Uncle Tom"" is, except we don’t. The popular Uncle Tom sucks up to the master and exhibits bovine patience. the real Uncle Tom is both a realist and a man of deep principle. When he is sold by Mr. Shelby in Kentucky, he knows enough of Shelby’s affairs to know that what his master asserts is true: it’s Tom who must go or the whole estate will be sold off for debt, including Tom’s wife and three children. Later, on the Legree estate, his religious faith tells him that the greatest danger he finds there is not to his life but to his soul. His logic is impeccable. He holds fast to his soul, in the face of suffering, in a way that even nonbelievers like myself must respect. In fact, Tom’s story eerily prefigures stories of spiritual solace through deep religious belief that have come out of both the Soviet Gulag and the Nazi concentration camp in the same way that the structure of power on Legree’s plantation, and the suffering endured there, forecasts and duplicates many stories of recent genocides.

The power of Uncle Tom’s Cabin is the power of brilliant analysis married to great wisdom of feeling. Stowe never forgets the logical end of any relationship in which one person is the subject and the other is the object. No matter how the two people feel, or what their intentions are, the logic of the relationship is inherently tragic and traps both parties until the false subject/object relationship is ended. Stowe’s most oft-repeated and potent representation of this inexorable logic is the forcible separation of family members, especially of mothers from children. Eliza, faced with the sale of her child, Harry, escapes across the breaking ice of the Ohio River. Lucy, whose ten-month-old is sold behind her back, kills herself. Prue, who has been used for breeding, must listen to her last child cry itself to death because her mistress won’t let her save it; she falls into alcoholism and thievery and is finally whipped to death. Cassy, prefiguring a choice made by one of the characters in Toni Morrison’s Beloved, kills her last child so that it won’t grow up in slavery. All of these women have been promised something by their owners–love, education, the privilege and joy of raising their children–but, owing to slavery, all of these promises have been broken. The grief and despair these women display is no doubt what T. S. Eliot was thinking of when he superciliously labeled Uncle Tom’s Cabin ""sensationalist propaganda,"" but, in fact, few critics in the nineteenth century ever accused Stowe of making up or even exaggerating such stories. One group of former slaves who were asked to comment on Stowe’s depiction of slave life said that she had failed to portray the very worst, and Stowe herself was afraid that if she told some of what she had heard from escaped slaves and other informants during her eighteen years in Cincinnati, the book would be too dark to find any readership at all.

Stowe’s analysis does not stop with the slave owners and traders, or with the slaves themselves. She understands perfectly that slavery is an economic system embedded in America as a whole, and she comments ironically on Christian bankers in New York whose financial dealings result in the sale of slaves, on Northern politicians who promote the capture of escaped slaves for the sake of the public good, on ministers of churches who give the system a Christian stamp of approval. One of Stowe’s most skillful techniques is her method of weaving a discussion of slavery into the dialogue of her characters. Especially interesting is a conversation Mark Twain could have paid attention to. Augustine St. Clare and his abolitionist cousin, Ophelia, are discussing his failure to act in accordance with his feelings of revulsion against slavery. After entertaining Ophelia’s criticisms for a period, Augustine points out that Ophelia herself is personally disgusted by black people and doesn’t like to come into contact with them. He says, ""You would think no harm in a child’s caressing a large dog, even if he was black . . . custom with us does what Christianity ought to do,–obliterates the feeling of personal prejudice."" When Ophelia takes over the education of Topsy, a child who has suffered a most brutal previous upbringing, she discovers that she can do nothing with her until she takes her, literally, to her bosom. But personal relationships do not mitigate the evils of slavery; Ophelia makes sure to give Topsy her freedom.

Stowe also understands that the real root of slavery is that it is profitable as well as customary. Augustine and his brother live with slavery because it is the system they know and because they haven’t the imagination to live without it. Simon Legree embraces slavery because he can make money from it and because it gives him even more absolute power over his workers than he could find in the North or in England.

The very heart of nineteenth-century American experience and literature, the nature and meaning of slavery, is finally what Twain cannot face in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. As Jim and Huck drift down Twain’s beloved river, the author finds himself nearing what must have been a crucial personal nexus: how to reconcile the felt memory of boyhood with the cruel implications of the social system within which that boyhood was lived. He had avoided this problem for the most part in Tom Sawyer: slaves hardly impinge on the lives of Tom and the other boys. But once Twain allows Jim a voice, this voice must speak in counterpoint to Huck’s voice and must raise issues that cannot easily be resolved, either personally or culturally. Harriet Beecher Stowe, New Englander, daughter of Puritans and thinkers, active in the abolitionist movement and in the effort to aid and educate escaped slaves, had no such personal conflict when she sat down to write Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Nothing about slavery was attractive to her either as a New Englander or as a resident of Cincinnati for almost twenty years. Her lack of conflict is apparent in the clarity of both the style and substance of the novel.

Why, then, we may ask, did Uncle Tom’s Cabin, for all its power and popularity, fail to spawn American literature? Fail, even, to work as a model for how to draw passionate, autonomous, and interesting black literary characters? Fail to keep the focus of the American literary imagination on the central dilemma of the American experience: race? Part of the reason is certainly that the public conversation about race and slavery that had been a feature of antebellum American life fell silent after the Civil War. Perhaps the answer is to be found in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: everyone opted for the ultimate distraction, lighting out for the territory. And the reason is to be found in Uncle Tom’s Cabin: that’s where the money was.

But so what? These are only authors, after all, and once a book is published the author can’t be held accountable for its role in the culture. For that we have to blame the citizens themselves, or their teachers, or their teachers, the arbiters of critical taste. In ""Melodramas of Beset Manhood: How Theories of American Fiction Exclude Women Authors,"" the scholar Nina Baym has already detailed how the canonization of a very narrow range of white, Protestant, middle-class male authors (Twain, Hawthorne, Melville, Emerson, etc.) has misrepresented our literary life–first by defining the only worthy American literary subject as ""the struggle of the individual against society [in which] the essential quality of America comes to reside in its unsettled wilderness and the opportunities that such a wilderness offers to the individual as the medium on which he may inscribe, unhindered, his own destiny and his own nature,"" and then by casting women, and especially women writers (specialists in the ""flagrantly bad best-seller,"" according to Leslie Fiedler), as the enemy. In such critical readings, all other themes and modes of literary expression fall out of consideration as ""un-American."" There goes Uncle Tom’s Cabin, there goes Edith Wharton, there goes domestic life as a subject, there go almost all the best-selling novelists of the nineteenth century and their readers, who were mostly women. The real loss, though, is not to our literature but to our culture and ourselves, because we have lost the subject of how the various social groups who may not escape to the wilderness are to get along in society; and, in the case of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the hard-nosed, unsentimental dialogue about race that we should have been having since before the Civil War. Obviously, Uncle Tom’s Cabin is no more the last word on race relations than The Brothers Karamazov or David Copperfield is on any number of characteristically Russian or English themes and social questions. Some of Stowe’s ideas about inherent racial characteristics (whites: cold, heartless; blacks: naturally religious and warm) are bad and have been exploded. One of her solutions to the American racial conflicts that she foresaw, a colony in Africa, she later repudiated. Nevertheless, her views about many issues were brilliant, and her heart was wise. She gained the respect and friendship of many men and women of goodwill, black and white, such as Frederick Douglass, the civil-rights activist Mary Church Terrill, the writer and social activist James Weldon Johnson, and W.E.B. Du Bois. What she did was find a way to talk about slavery and family, power and law, life and death, good and evil, North and South. She truly believed that all Americans together had to find a solution to the problem of slavery in which all were implicated. When her voice, a courageously public voice–as demonstrated by the public arguments about slavery that race throughout Uncle Tom’s Cabin–fell silent in our culture and was replaced by the secretive voice of Huck Finn, who acknowledges Jim only when they are alone on the raft together out in the middle of the big river, racism fell out of the public world and into the private one, where whites think it really is but blacks know it really isn’t.

Should Huckleberry Finn be taught in the schools? The critics of the Propaganda Era laid the groundwork for the universal inclusion of the book in school curriculums by declaring it great. Although they predated the current generation of politicized English professors, this was clearly a political act, because the entry of Huck Finn into classrooms sets the terms of the discussion of racism and American history, and sets them very low: all you have to do to be a hero is acknowledge that your poor sidekick is human; you don’t actually have to act in the interests of his humanity. Arguments about censorship have been regularly turned into nonsense by appeals to Huck’s ""greatness."" Moreover, so much critical thinking has gone into defending Huck so that he can be great, so that American literature can be found different from and maybe better than Russian or English or French literature, that the very integrity of the critical enterprise has been called into question. That most readers intuitively reject the last twelve chapters of the novel on the grounds of tedium or triviality is clear from the fact that so many critics have turned themselves inside out to defend them. Is it so mysterious that criticism has failed in our time after being so robust only a generation ago? Those who cannot be persuaded that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a great novel have to draw some conclusion.

I would rather my children read Uncle Tom’s Cabin, even though it is far more vivid in its depiction of cruelty than Huck Finn, and this is because Stowe’s novel is clearly and unmistakably a tragedy. No whitewash, no secrets, but evil, suffering, imagination, endurance, and redemption–just like life. Like little Eva, who eagerly but fearfully listens to the stories of the slaves that her family tries to keep from her, our children want to know what is going on, what has gone on, and what we intend to do about it. If ""great"" literature has any purpose, it is to help us face up to our responsibilities instead of enabling us to avoid them once again by lighting out for the territory."
The Workingman's HymnJoshua Davis,"[Verse 1]
Some people hunger for the greenback bill
Some folks hunger for the top of the hill
Some people just tryin' to get a decent meal
Well I know that we can turn it around
Some people sleepin' in a fine feather bed
Some folks are dreamin' of an old homestead
Some just need a place to lay their head
Well I know that we can turn it around

[Chorus]
I know that we can turn it around
There's one thing that I've found
If there's a force in the dim singin' a workingman's hymn
I know that we can turn it around

[Verse 2]
River bottom up to home on high
In the light of the endless sky
Jetsettin' or just gettin' by
I know that we can turn it around

[Chorus]
I know that we can turn it around
There's one thing that I've found
If there's a force in the dim singin' a workingman's hymn
I know that we can turn it around

[Bridge]
From the 9th Ward up to Patoka Lake
One man's joy's been another man's pain
But the sun keeps shinin' through the drivin' rain
And I know that we can turn it around

[Chorus]
I know that we can turn it around
There's one thing that I've found
If there's a force in the dim singin' a workingman's hymn
I know that we can turn it around
I know that we can turn it around
There's one thing that I've found
If there's a force in the dim singin' a workingman's hymn
I know that we can turn it around
I know that we can turn it around"
HallelujahJoshua Davis,"[Verse 1]
Now let’s dive inside the Scriptures
Where we will define God’s Kingdom
It’s His rule and reign and wide dominion from all times beginning
Genesis 1—God the King rules over all
Verse 16, for “rule” the Hebrew word used is mashal ( מֶמְשָׁלהָ related to משל)
See His kingdom order:
Heavenly lights rule day and night, but over birds, beasts, and the fish of water—
God makes man in His image and the distinction, is this:
He hands him dominion and commands him his mission:
To rule over the land and animals mentioned
By expansion, extension, advancing His kingdom
Through his grandsons and kinsmen
The Tree of Life stands for the reward of life God will grant him and give them
See God the Creator King who made all things
Made Adam His vice-king (i.e., vice-regent) and the earth He gave to him (Ps. 115:16)
In His image He made him in to reign like Him:
Meaning to love righteousness and hate all sin!
Hence the other tree to distinguish good from evil
And extinguish anything that looks deceitful
Because as Yahweh separated light from dark—
King Adam was to discern and be wise in heart!
As God finished His work on day 7—He blessed it
Sat down on His Sabbath-Throne, in heaven He rested;
Thus if Adam obeys and endures the test
Then he’ll sit on His Sabbath-Throne of glory rest
And creation will be transformed and blessed
How now is he ruled by sin and the chords of death?
You should put every one of the beasts under your feet
Including the Serpent, who comes in deceit!
You should have bruised and cursed him, and removed the Serpent
But you choose to serve him—now he rules as your king!
And since you forfeited to govern the kingdom
A Son of Adam/Son of Man will recover dominion!

[Chorus 1]
The Kingdom of God is heaven breaking in
Since the Fall to abolish the reign of sin
To advance creation to its greater end
All Praise to the Son of Adam, Son of David King! (2x)

[Verse 2]
Then in the beginning pages, with sin’s brutal entrance
Death, Satan, (and) sin is reigning—now we see there is 2 kingdoms:
God’s saving rule over His covenant people
And Satan’s slavish rule over those governed by evil
Because we see the word mashal ( משל ) “to rule” again
In Genesis 4 with Cain, but now sin is ruling him! (Gen. 4:7)
Yet see this crucial thing:
Chapter 17 God promises through Abraham will come those who are kings! (Gen. 17:6, 16)
So it’s clear through Abraham’s family tree
God will bring about His saving reign for humanity
On 2 passages we have to gaze, about a Son of Adam’s reign
That will happen in the latter days ( בְּאַחֲרִ֥ית הַיָּמִֽים):
First, Jacob says the scepter won’t depart from Judah
So this specific tribe is set apart as Ruler (Chapter 49! [v. 10])
Then Balaam in Numbers 24 said:
A Scepter from Israel will crush the enemy’s forehead! (Numb. 24:17)
He will suffer then be glorified it’s foreshadowed by Joseph
Working mighty acts of judgment, patterned by the staff of Moses
Kingdom precious laws expressed in the Decalogue (Ex. 20)
Blessings fall, if they’re kept, lest you get His Scepter-Rod (Deut. 28)
In the book of Deuteronomy in chapter 17
The LORD gives His standard for the man that He will bless as king:
He’ll keep the Law on his heart, the Torah He will guard
He won’t be haughty like Saul, He’ll be in awe of his God! (Deut. 17:14-20)
Joshua’s a ruler-figure!
Leading a kingdom of priests, carrying God’s throne on dry ground through the River (Josh. 3-5)
To drive out the brood of sinners
From the Land God promised them
So Joshua’s slaughtering! (Josh. 6, 10-12)
Idolaters, they conquered them
Because these Gentile kingdoms are the embodiment of the demonic kin
Bringing the Ark of the Covenant (Josh. 3:3-17; 6:4-21)
And this is symbolizing that the Kingdom of God is judging them (INTRUSION!)
These counterfeit kingdoms, now have an ending
Surrounded by the thousands of rowdy shouts that’s against them. (Josh. 6:16-21)
Because His judgment reserved for the end of time
INTRUDES into History by His set design (INTRUSION!)
Now we should discuss this:
Israel needs a wise human king, that’s the point of the Book of Judges (Judges 1:1-2; 18:1)
Because without a king who’s discerning good from evil
To idols they turn as perverted, crooked people (Judges 17:5-6; 21:25)
So David is God’s choice as king (1 Sam. 16:1)
Anointed twice—privately then publicly
To his Greater Son this points to Him (1 Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 5:1-3)
Psalm 8—he sees himself as a second Adam
With the Majestic One David’s impressed when asking:
“who is man that You’re mindful of him
Or the Son of Adam ( וּבֶן־אָ֜דָ֗ם ) that You assign as a king?!?”
Verse 6 in the English—
Mashal ( משל ) is used, he says “you caused him to rule” ( תַּמְשִׁילֵהוּ)
Because he’s given dominion
Thus the Judah-Ruler is him (Gen. 49:10; Judges 1:1-2)
Only David could dispossess and remove Jebusites from Jerusalem (Josh. 15:63; Judges 1:21; 2 Sam
5:6-10)
It’s the Kingdom-City (Zion!)
If the kingdoms are submitting
David gives them pity or they’re smitten really quickly! (Ps. 2:10-12)
Though Solomon had a kingdom of peace
He’s subdued by the dominion of sin and they slippery beast (Satan!)
He couldn’t line up to his own kingly wisdom
In Proverbs, because sin’s throne is within men!
Though Solomon’s kingdom and fame extends
He and his sons couldn’t put an end to the reign of sin
They’re exiled, David’s royal line’s dethroned (2 Chr. 36:11-21)
But God’s Faithfulness will in time be shown!
Because Yahweh’s Covenant Love won’t be severed (Ps. 89:24-34)
He promised David’s Son must sit on his throne forever (Ps. 132:11)
Psalm 89—God will not lie to David! (Ps. 89:35-37)
He’ll send the Lion of Judah, to die and then raise Him!!! (Rev. 5:5-6)

[Chorus 1]
The Kingdom of God is heaven breaking in
Since the Fall to abolish the reign of sin
To advance creation to its greater end
All Praise to the Son of Adam, Son of David King! (2x)

[Verse 3]
The Kingdom of God is an Old Testament Concept
Which was promised of old and stressed by the Prophets (Daniel 2:31-35; 44-45; Obadiah 21)
The end-time Kingdom would bring in the Day of the LORD
To save His people, and His foes get slain with the Sword! (Zeph. 1:7-2:3)
And there’s 2 Ages:
This Age, and the Age to Come—but the Age to Come has 2 phases
And the first phase has begun; (1 Cor. 10:11)
Because the heavenly-order is the Kingdom proclaimed by the Son! (Mark 1:14-15)
The Kingdom of Heaven is already breaking through
To end the rule of death and Satan enslaving you
Because whether through (love of) jewelry or pearls
Or the beauty of a girl
Satan reigns as “the ruler of this world” (John 12:31; 14:30; Eph. 2:2; 6:12)
So in the Gospel of Mark
The ministry of the Son of God has its start with this awesome remark:
“The time is fulfilled—His Kingdom is at hand” (Mark 1:14-15)
Because in the wilderness He overthrew the king over man (Luke 10:17-19)
Thus the Kingdom arrived, because the King had arrived
And its Inauguration was evidenced by its signs! (Matt. 4:23)
Think it’s only future? You’re wrong dude:
Demons cast out by the Spirit proves His Kingdom has come upon you! (Matt. 12:22-29)
Bringing Heaven’s Assault to subject the revolt of Satan that affected us all and rescue our souls
It’s Satanic dethronement by Ransom’s Atonement (John 12:30-32; Col. 2:15)
Hence the “strong man” (ἰσχυρός) is bound by a “Stronger” Man (ὁ ἰσχυρότερός) now! (Mark 1:7; 3:27)
I have got a lot to say about the βασιλεία
It’s about the Will of the Father, hence His Awesome Prayer! (Matt. 6:10)
But His Kingdom far surpasses expectations
To just rescue from Rome’s oppressive nation
(It’s) more than Restoration and reclamation
Of what king-Adam lost to sin, death, and Satan;
But rather this Last Adam advances this wrecked creation
Unto its heavenly destination!
Through Him all His brethren risen
Solomonic Splendid Wisdom (Matt. 12:42)
He received all honor from the Father at Ascension, given (Philip. 2:9-11; Eph. 1:20-21)
Resurrected to extend dominion through His blessed kinsman (Eph. 1:22)
(He) poured His Spirit out upon them, now we spread His Temple Kingdom! (Acts 2:33; 1:8)
The Resurrected Lord—indeed!
In Matthew 28 says “all authority” is restored to Me (Matt. 28:18-20)
So Jesus Reigns NOW (Rev. 12:10-12)
But you say, “HOW?”
His kingdom spreads through His suffering-Church and great trials (Rev. 1:9)
His reign’s expressed through the Church; the gates of hell can’t prevail (Matt. 16:18)
Because the power of His Resurrection exerts (Eph. 1:19-20)
Soon we’ll rest from our works (Heb. 4:8-10)
And sit with Him on His Sabbath-Glory Throne when He brings heaven to earth (Rev. 3:21)
This Psalm 72 King will save the poor (Ps. 72:2-4, 12-14; James 2:5)
With grace galore, David’s Son is really David’s “Lord” ( אֲדניִֹ Adonai)! (Ps. 110:1; Matt. 22:41-46)
But whose ever heard of an All-Compassionate Potentate
Who calls His Royal Children to cry out at His Throne of Grace
Now to the Christian living in enslavement to porn
Know that over you sin doesn’t reign anymore
Because through your Union with Christ, you’re raised with the Lord
There’s been a breach with sin—a deep change at the core!
Deep within your inner being
The Spirit of the King is seated
(plus) Jesus is your Priest-King who’s continually interceding
No longer slaves to sinning, by faith we’re in Him
Transferred from Satan’s reign to His New Creation Kingdom (Col. 1:13-14)
BUT NOT YET in the full bliss of its Wholeness (Rev. 11:15)
“Come, Lord Jesus!” Bring the Kingdom in its Fullness! (1 Cor. 15:24-26)
We await the full bliss of its Wholeness (Rev. 21:10, 22:1-5)
“Come, Lord Jesus!” Bring the Kingdom in its Fullness! (Hallelujah)

[Chorus 2]
The Kingdom of God is His Saving Rule
Through King Jesus whose reign is true
Sin, death, and Satan, He’ll straight subdue
Right Now—all things are being made His stool (1 Cor. 15:24-26; Ps. 110) 2x

[Chorus 1]
The Kingdom of God is heaven breaking in
Since the Fall to abolish the reign of sin
To advance creation to its greater end
All Praise to the Son of Adam, Son of David King! (2x)"

Simple ManSawyer Fredericks,"They [blacks] are at least as brave, and more adventure some [compared to whites]. But this may perhaps proceed from a want of fore-thought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present - They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those number-less afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in labor.

- Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia
(187-88) 
Almost nineteenth Euro-American intellectual of the ninteenth century could have written the preceding words.The notion of Negro inferiority was so deeply pervasive among those heirs of ""The Enlightment"" that the categories and even the vocabulary of Negro inferiority were formalized into a tedious, unmodulated litany. This uniformity increased rather than diminished during the course of the century. As Leon Litwack and others have shown, even the Abolitionists, who actively opposed slavery, frequently regarded blacks as inherently inferior. This helps to explain the widespread popularity of colonization schemes among Abolitionists and other liberals.1 As for Jefferson, it is not surprising that he held such ideas, but it is impressive that he formulated so clearly at the end of the eighteenth century what would become the dominant view of the Negro in the nineteenth century. In many ways, this Father of American Democracy - and quite possibly of five mulatto children - was a man of his time and ahead of his time.2

In July of 1876, exactly one century after the American Declaration of Independence, Mark Twain began writing Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a novel which illustrates trenchantly the social limitations which American ""civilization"" imposes on individual freedom. The book takes special note of ways in which racism impinges upon the lives of Afro-Americans, even when they are legally ""free."" It is therefore ironic that Huckleberry Finn has often been attacked and even censored as a racist work. I would argue, on the contrary, that except for Melville's work, Huckleberry Finn is without peers among major Euro-American novels for its explicitly anti-racist stance.3 Those who brand the book ""racist""generally do so without having considered the specific form of racial discourse to which the novel responds. Furthermore, Huckleberry Finn offers much more than the typical liberal defenses of ""human dignity"" and protests against cruelty. Though it contains some such elements, it is more fundamentally a critique of those socially constituted fictions- most notably romanticism, religion, and the concept of ""the Negro"" - which serve to justify and to disguise selfish, cruel, and exploitative behavior.

When I speak of ""racial discourse,"" I mean more than simply attitudes about ""race"" or conventions of talking about ""race."" Most importantly, I mean that ""race"" itself is a discursive formation, which delimits social relations on the basis of alleged physical differences.4 ""Race"" is a strategy for relegating a segment of the population to a permanent inferior status. It functions by insisting that each ""race"" has specific, definitive, inherent behavioral tendencies and capacities, which distinguish it from other ""races."" Though scientifically specious, ""race"" has been powerfully effective as an ideology and as a form of social definition, which serves the interests of Euro-American hegemony. In America, race has been deployed against numerous groups, including Native Americans, Jews, Asians, and even - for brief periods - an assortment of European immigrants.

For obvious reasons, however, the primary emphasis historically has been on defining ""the Negro"" as a deviant from Euro- American norms. ""Race"" in America means white supremacy and black inferiority5; and ""the Negro,"" a socially constituted fiction, is a generalized, one-dimensional surrogate for the historical reality of Afro-American people. It is this reified fiction which Twain attacks in Huckleberry Finn. Twain adopts a strategy of subversion in his attack on race. That is, he focuses on a number of commonplaces associated with ""the Negro,"" and then he systematically dramatizes their inadequacy. He uses the term ""nigger,"" and he shows Jim engaging in superstitious behavior. Yet he portrays Jim as a compassionate, shrewd, thoughtful, self-sacrificing and even wise man. Indeed, his portrayal of Jim contradicts every claim presented in Jefferson's description of ""the Negro."" Jim is cautious, he gives excellent advice, he suffers persistent anguish over separation from his wife and child, and he even sacrifices his own sleep in order that Huck may rest. Jim, in short, exhibits all qualities that ""the Negro"" supposedly lacks. Twain's conclusions do more than merely subvert the justifications of slavery, which was already long since abolished. Twain began this book during the final disintegration of Reconstruction, and his satire on antebellum Southern bigotry is also an implicit response to the Negrophobic climate of the post-Reconstruction era (Berkove; Gollin; Egan, esp. 66-102). It is troubling, therefore, that so many readers have completely misunderstood Twain's subtle attack on racism.

Twain's use of the word ""nigger"" has provoked some readers to reject the novel. (See Hentoff). As one of the most offensive words in our vocabulary, ""nigger"" remains heavily shrouded in taboo. A careful assessment of this term within the context of American racial discourse, however, will allow us to understand the particular way in which the author uses it. If we attend closely to Twain's use of the word, we may find in it not just a trigger to outrage, but more importantly, a means of understanding the precise nature of American racism and Mark Twain's attack on it.

Most obviously, Twain uses ""nigger"" throughout the book as a synonym for ""slave."" There is ample evidence from other sources that this corresponds to one usage common during the Antebellum period. We first encounter it in reference to ""Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim"" (Ch. 2). This usage, like the term ""nigger stealer,"" clearly designates the ""nigger"" as a piece of property: a commodity, a slave. This passage also provides the only apparent textual justification for the common critical practice of labelling Jim, ""Nigger Jim,"" as if ""nigger"" were a part of his proper name. This loathsome habit goes back at least as far as Albert Bigelow Paine's biography of Twain (1912). In any case, ""nigger"" in this sense connotes an inferior, even subhuman, creature, who is properly owned by and subservient to Euro-Americans. Both Huck and Jim use the word in this sense. For example, when Huck fabricates his tale about the riverboat accident, the following exchange occurs between him and Aunt Sally:
'Good gracious! anybody hurt?'
'No'm. Killed a nigger.'
'Well, it's lucky, because sometimes people do
get hurt' (Ch. 32).Huck has never met Aunt Sally prior to this scene, and in spinning a lie which this stranger will find unobjectionable, he correctly assumes that the common notion of Negro subhumanity will be appropriate. Huck's off-hand remark is intended to exploit Aunt Sally's attitudes, not to express Huck's own. A nigger, Aunt Sally confirms, is not a person. Yet this exchange is hilarious, precisely because we know that Huck is playing upon her glib and conventional bigotry. We know that Huck's relationship to Jim has already invalidated for him such obtuse racial notions. The conception of the ""nigger"" is a socially constituted and sanctioned fiction, and it is just as false and as absurd as Huck's explicit fabrication, which Aunt Sally also swallows whole.

In fact, the exchange between Huck and Aunt Sally reveals a great deal about how racial discourse operates. Its function is to promulgate a conception of ""the Negro"" as a subhuman and expendable creature, who is by definition feeble-minded, immoral, lazy, and superstitious. One crucial purpose of this social fiction is to justify the abuse and exploitation of Afro-American people by substituting the essentialist fiction of ""Negro-ism"" for the actual character of individual Afro-Americans. Hence, in racial discourse every Afro-American becomes just another instance of ""the Negro"" - just another ""nigger."" Twain recognizes this invidious tendency of race- thinking, however, and he takes every opportunity to expose the mismatch between racial abstractions and real human beings.

For example, when Pap drunkenly inveighs against the free mulatto from Ohio, he is outraged by what appears to him as a crime against natural laws. (Ch. 6). In the first place, a ""free nigger"" is, for Pap, a contradiction in terms. Indeed, the man's clothes, his demeanor, his education, his profession, and even his silver-headed cane bespeak a social status normally achieved by only a small elite of white men. He is, in other words, a ""nigger"" who refuses to behave like a ""nigger."" Pap's ludicrous protestations discredit both himself and other believers in ""the Negro,"" as many critics have noted. But it has"" not been sufficiently stressed that Pap's racial views correspond very closely to those of most of his white Southern contemporaries, in substance if not in manner of expression. Such views were held not only by poor whites but by all ""right-thinking"" Southerners, regardless of their social class. Indeed, not even the traumas of the Civil War would cure Southerners of this folly. Furthermore, Pap's indignation at the Negro's right to vote is precisely analogous to the Southern backlash against the enfranchisement of Afro-Americans during Reconstruction. Finally, Pap's comments are rather mild compared to the anti-Negro diatribes which were beginning to emerge among politicians even as Twain was writing Huckleberry Finn. He began writing this novel during the final days of Reconstruction, and it seems more than reasonable to assume that the shameful white supremacist bluster of that epoch - exemplified by Pap's tirade - informed Twain's critique of racism in Huckleberry Finn. (See Pettit, Mark Twain and the South, 35-50).

Pap's final description of this Ohio gentlemen as ""a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free-nigger"" (Ch. 6) almost totally contradicts his previous description of the man as a proud, elegant, dignified figure. Yet this contradiction is perfectly consistent with Pap's need to reassert ""the Negro"" in lieu of social reality. Despite the vulgarity of Pap's personal character, his thinking about race is highly conventional and, therefore, respectable. But most of us cannot respect Pap's views, and when we reject them, we reject the standard racial discourse of both 1840 and 1880.

A reader who objects to the word ""nigger"" might still insist that Twain could have avoided using it. But it is difficult to imagine how Twain could have debunked a discourse without using the specific terms of that discourse. Even when Twain was writing his book, ""nigger"" was universally recognized as an insulting, demeaning word. According to Stuart Berg Flexner, ""Negro"" was generally pronounced as ""nigger"" until about 1825, at which time Abolitionists began objecting to that term (57). They preferred ""colored person"" or ""person of color."" Hence, W. E. B. Du Bois reports that some black Abolitionists of the early 1830s declared themselves united ""as men, . . . not as slaves; as 'people of color,' not as 'Negroes' "" (245). Writing a generation later in Army Life in a Black Regiment (1869), Thomas Wentworth Higginson deplored the common use of ""nigger"" among freedmen, which he regarded as evidence of low self-esteem (28). The objections to ""nigger,"" then, are not a consequence of the modern sensibility but had been common for a half century before Huckleberry Finn was published. The specific function of this term in the book, however, is neither to offend nor merely to provide linguistic authenticity. Much more importantly, it establishes a context against which Jim's specific virtues may emerge as explicit refutations of racist presuppositions.

Of course, the concept of the ""nigger"" entails far more than just the deployment of certain vocabulary. Most of the attacks on the book focus on its alleged perpetuation of racial stereotypes. Twain does indeed use racial stereotypes here. That practice could be excused as characteristic of the genre of humor within which Twain works. Frontier humor relies upon the use of stock types, and consequently, racial stereotypes are just one of many types present in Huckleberry Finn. Yet while valid, such an appeal to generic convention would be unsatisfactory, because it would deny Twain the credit which he deserves for the sophistication of his perceptions (see Ellison, Hansen, Lynn).

As a serious critic of American society, Twain recognized that racial discourse depends upon the deployment of a system of stereotypes which constitute ""the Negro"" as fundamentally different from and inferior to Euro-Americans. As with his handling of ""nigger,"" Twain's strategy with racial stereotypes is to elaborate them in order to undermine them. To be sure, those critics are correct who have argued that Twain uses this narrative to reveal Jim's humanity. Jim, however, is just one individual. Much more importantly, Twain uses the narrative to expose the cruelty and hollowness of that racial discourse which exists only to obscure the humanity of all Afro-American people.

One aspect of Huckleberry Finn which has elicited copious critical commentary is Twain's use of superstition (see especially Hoffman, ""Jim's Magic""). In nineteenth century racial discourse, ""the Negro"" was always defined as inherently superstitious.6 Many critics, therefore, have cited Jim's superstitious behavior as an instance of negative stereotyping. One cannot deny that in this respect Jim closely resembles the entire tradition of comic darkies (see Woodard and MacCann), but to observe this similarity is a negligible feat. The issue is, does Twain merely reiterate cliches, or does he use these conventional patterns to make an unconventional point? A close examination will show that in virtually every instance, Twain uses Jim's superstition to make points which undermine rather than revalidate the dominant racial discourse.

The first incident of this superstitious behavior occurs in Chapter 2, as a result of one of Tom Sawyer's pranks. When Jim falls asleep under a tree, Tom hangs his hat on a branch. Subsequently, Jim concocts an elaborate tale about having been hexed and ridden by witches. The tale grows more grandiose with subsequent retellings, and eventually Jim becomes a local celebrity, sporting a five-cent piece on a string around his neck as a talisman. ""Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country,"" the narrator reports. Jim's celebrity finally reaches the point that ""Jim was most ruined, for a servant, because he got so stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches."" This is, no doubt, amusing. Yet whether Jim believes his own tale or not - and the ""superstitious Negro"" thesis requires us to assume that he does - the fact remains that Jim clearly benefits from becoming more a celebrity and less a ""servant."" It is his owner, not Jim, who suffers when Jim's uncompensated labor diminishes.7

This incident has often been interpreted as an example of risible Negro gullibility and ignorance, as exemplified by blackface minstrelsy. Such a reading has more than a little validity, but can only partially account for the implications of this scene. If not for the final sentence, such an account might seem wholly satisfactory, but the information that Jim becomes, through his own storytelling, unsuited for life as a slave, introduces unexpected complications. Is it likely that Jim has been deceived by his own creative prevarications - especially given what we learn about his character subsequently? Or has he cleverly exploited the conventions of ""Negro superstition"" in order to turn a silly boy's prank to his own advantage?

Regardless of whether we credit Jim with forethought in this matter, it is undeniable that he turns Tom's attempt to humiliate him into a major personal triumph. In other words, Tom gives him an inch, and he takes an ell. It is also obvious that he does so by exercising remarkable skills as a rhetorician. By constructing a fictitious narrative of his own experience, Jim elevates himself above his prescribed station in life. By becoming, in effect, an author, Jim writes himself a new destiny. Jim's triumph may appear to be dependent upon the gullibility of other ""superstitious"" Negroes, but since we have no direct encounter with them, we cannot know whether they are unwitting victims of Jim's ruse or not. A willing audience need not be a totally credulous one. In any case, it is intelligence, not stupidity, which facilitates Jim's triumph. Tom may have had his chuckle, but the last laugh, clearly, belongs to Jim.

In assessing Jim's character, we should keep in mind that forethought, creativity and shrewdness are qualities which racial discourse - see Thomas Jefferson - denies to ""the Negro."" In that sense, Jim's darky performance here subverts the fundamental definition of the darky. For ""the Negro"" is defined to be an object, not a subject. Yet does an object construct its own narrative? Viewed in this way, the fact of superstition, which traditionally connotes ignorance and unsophistication, becomes far less important than the ends to which superstition is put. This inference exposes, once again, the inadequacy of a positivist epistemology, which holds, for example, that ""a rose is a rose is a rose."" No one will deny the self-evidence of a tautology; but a rose derives whatever meaning it has from the context within which it is placed (including the context of traditional symbolism.) It is the contextualizing activity, not das Ding-an-sich, which generates meaning. Again and again, Twain attacks racial essentialism by directing our attention, instead, to the particularity of individual action. We find that Jim is not ""the Negro."" Jim is Jim, and we, like Huck, come to understand what Jim is by attending to what he does in specific situations.

In another instance of explicitly superstitious behavior, Jim uses a hairball to tell Huck's fortune. One may regard this scene as a comical example of Negro ignorance and credulity, acting in concert with the ignorance and credulity of a fourteen-year-old white boy. That reading would allow one an unambiguous laugh at Jim's expense. If one examines the scene carefully, however, the inadequacy of such a reductive reading becomes apparent. Even if Jim does believe in the supernatural powers of this hairball, the fact remains that most of the transaction depends upon Jim's quick wits. For example, the soothsaying aside, much of the exchange between Huck and Jim is an exercise in wily and understated economic bartering. In essence, Jim wants to be paid for his services, while Huck wants free advice. Jim insists that the hairball will not speak without being paid. Huck, who has a dollar, will only admit to having a counterfeit quarter. Jim responds by pretending to be in collusion with Huck. He explains how to doctor the ""quarter"" so that ""anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball"" (Ch. 4). But obviously it is not the hair-ball who will benefit from acquiring and spending this counterfeit coin (cf. Weaver and Williams).

In this transaction, Jim serves his own interests while appearing to serve Huck's interests. He takes a slug which is worthless to Huck, and through the alchemy of his own cleverness, he contrives to make it worth twenty-five cents to himself. That, in antebellum America, is not a bad price for telling a fortune. But more importantly, Twain shows Jim self- consciously subverting the prescribed definition of ""the Negro,"" even as he performs within the limitations of that role. He remains the conventional ""Negro"" by giving the white boy what he wants, at no real cost, and by consistently appearing to be passive and subservient to the desires of Huck and the hair-ball. But in fact, he serves his own interests all along. Such resourcefulness is hardly consistent with the familiar, one-dimensional concept of ""the superstitious Negro.""

And while Jim's reading is formulaic, it is hardly simple-minded. He sees the world as a kind of Manichean universe, in which forces of light and darkness - white and black - vie for dominance. Pap, he says, is uncertain what to do, torn between his white and black angels. Jim's advice, ""to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way"" (Ch. 4), turns out to be good advice, because Huck greatly enjoys life in the cabin, despite Pap's fits of drunken excess. This mixture of pleasure and pain is precisely what Jim predicts. Admittedly, Jim's conceptual framework is not original. Nonetheless, his reading carries considerable force, because it corresponds so neatly to the dominant thematic patterns in this book, and more broadly, to the sort of dualistic thinking which informs much of Twain's work. (To take an obvious example, consider the role reversals and character contrasts in Pudd'n-head Wilson or The Prince and the Pauper). And most immediately, Jim's comments here reflect tellingly upon his situation as a black slave in racist America. The slave's fate is always torn between his master's will and his own.

In this reading and other incidents, Jim emerges as an astute and sensitive observer of human behavior, both in his comments regarding Pap and in his subtle remarks to Huck. Jim clearly possesses a subtlety and intelligence which ""the Negro"" allegedly lacks. Twain makes this point more clearly in the debate scene in Chapter 15. True enough, most of this debate is, as several critics have noted, conventional minstrel show banter. Nevertheless, Jim demonstrates impressive reasoning abilities, despite his factual ignorance. For example, in their argument over ""Poly-voo-franzy,"" Huck makes a category error by implying that the difference between languages is analogous to the difference between human language and cat language. While Jim's response - that man should talk like a man - betrays his ignorance of cultural diversity, his argument is perceptive and structurally sound. The humor in Huck' s conclusion, ""you can't learn a nigger how to argue,"" arises precisely from our recognition that Jim's argument is better than Huck's.

Throughout the novel, Twain presents Jim in ways which render ludicrous the conventional wisdom about ""Negro character."" As an intelligent, sensitive, wily and considerate individual, Jim demonstrates that one's race provides no useful index of one's character. While that point may seem obvious to many contemporary readers, it is a point rarely made by nineteenth-century Euro-American novelists. Indeed, except for Melville, J. W. DeForest, Albion Tourgee, and George Washington Cable, white novelists virtually always portrayed Afro-American characters as exemplifications of ""Negroness."" In this regard, the twentieth century has been little better. By presenting us a series of glimpses which penetrate the ""Negro"" exterior and reveal the person beneath it, Twain debunks American racial discourse. For racial discourse maintains that the ""Negro"" exterior is all that a ""Negro"" really has.

This insight in itself is a notable accomplishment. Twain, however, did not view racism as an isolated phenomenon, and it was his effort to place racism within the context of other cultural traditions which produced the most problematic aspect of his novel. For it is in the final chapters - the Tom Sawyer section - which most critics consider the weakest part of the book, that Twain links his criticisms of slavery and Southern romanticism, condemning the cruelties which both of these traditions entail. (See Altenbernd). Critics have objected to these chapters on various grounds. Some of the most common are that Jim becomes reduced to a comic darky (e.g., Marx, Schmitz), that Tom's antics undermine the seriousness of the novel, and that these burlesque narrative developments destroy the structural integrity of the novel. Most critics see this conclusion as an evasion of the difficult issues which the novel has raised. There is no space here for a discussion of the structural issues, but it seems to me that as a critique of American racial discourse, these concluding chapters offer a harsh, coherent, and uncompromising indictment.

Tom Sawyer's absurd scheme to ""rescue"" Jim offends, because the section begins with Huck's justly celebrated crisis of conscience, which culminates in his resolve to free Jim, even if doing so condemns him to hell. The passage which leads to Huck's decision, as familiar as it is, merits reexamination:
I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around, and see that paper ....I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: 'All right, then, I'll go to hell' - and tore it up (Ch.31).The issue here is not just whether or not Huck should return a contraband8 - an escaped slave - to its proper owner. More fundamentally, Huck must decide whether to accept the conventional wisdom which defines ""Negroes"" as subhuman commodities, or the evidence of his own experience, which has shown Jim to be a good and kind man and a true friend.

Huck makes the obvious decision, but his doing so represents more than simply a liberal choice of conscience over social convention. Twain explicitly makes Huck's choice a sharp attack on the Southern church. Huck scolds himself: ""Here was the Sunday school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd done it they'd a learnt you, there, that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire"" (Ch. 31). Yet despite Huck's anxiety, his choice is obviously correct. Furthermore, by the time that Twain wrote these words, more than twenty years of national strife, including Civil War and Reconstruction, had established Huck's conclusion regarding slavery as a dominant national consensus. Not even reactionary Southerners advocated a reinstitution of slavery. Since the Southern church had taught that slavery was God's will, Huck's decision flatly repudiates the church's teachings regarding slavery. And implicitly, it also repudiates the church as an institution by suggesting that the church functions to undermine, not to encourage, a reliance on one's conscience. To define ""Negroes"" as subhuman removes them from moral consideration and therefore justifies the callous exploitation of them. This view of religion is consistent with the cynical iconoclasm which Twain expressed in Letters from the Earth and others of his ""dark"" works.9

In this context, Tom Sawyer appears to us as a superficially charming but fundamentally distasteful interloper. His actions are governed not by conscience but rather by romantic conventions and literary ""authorities."" Indeed, while Tom may appear to be a kind of renegade, he is in essence thoroughly conventional in his values and proclivities. Despite all his boyish pranks, Tom represents a kind of solid respectability- a younger version of the Southern gentleman, as exemplified by the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons (see Hoffman, Form and Fable, 327-28). Hence, when Tom proposes to help Huck steal Jim, Huck laments that ""Tom Sawyer fell, considerable, in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer a nigger stealen"" (Ch. 33). Such liberating activity is proper for Huck, who is not respectable, but not for Tom, who is. As with the previous example, however, this one implies a deep criticism of the status quo. Huck's act of conscience, which most of us would now endorse, is possible only for an outsider. This hardly speaks well for the moral integrity of Southern (or American) ""civilization.""

To examine Tom's role in the novel, let us begin at the end. Upon learning of the failed escape attempt and Jim's recapture, Tom cries out, self-righteously: ""turn him loose! He ain't no slave; he's as free as any creatur that walks this earth"" (Ch. 42). Tom has known all along that his cruel and ludicrous scheme to rescue the captured ""prisoner"" was being enacted upon a free man; and indeed, only his silence regarding Jim's status allowed the scheme to proceed with Jim's cooperation. Certainly, neither Huck nor Jim would otherwise have indulged Tom's foolishness. Tom's gratuitous cruelty here in the pursuit of his own amusement corresponds to his less vicious prank against Jim in Chapter 2 . And just as before, Twain converts Tom's callous mischief into a personal triumph for Jim.

Not only has Jim suffered patiently, which would in truth represent a doubtful virtue. (Jim is not Uncle Tom.) Jim demonstrates his moral superiority by surrendering himself in order to assist the doctor in treating his wounded tormentor. This is hardly the behavior which one would expect from a commodity, and it is precisely Jim's status - man or chattel - which has been fundamentally at issue throughout the novel. It may be true that Tom's lengthy juvenile antics subvert the tone of the novel, but they also provide the necessary backdrop for Jim's noble act. Up to this point, we have been able to admire Jim's good sense and to respond sentimentally to his good character. This, however, is the first time that we see him making a significant (and wholly admirable) moral decision. His act sets him apart from everyone else in the novel except Huck. And modestly (if not disingenuously), he claims to be behaving just as Tom Sawyer would. Always conscious of his role as a ""Negro,"" Jim knows better than to claim personal credit for his good deed. Yet the contrast between Jim's behavior and Tom's is unmistakable. Huck declares that Jim is ""white inside"" (Ch. 40). He apparently intends this as a compliment, but Tom is fortunate that Jim does not behave like most of the whites in the novel.

Twain also contrasts Jim's self-sacrificing compassion with the cruel and mean-spirited behavior of his captors, emphasizing that white skin does not justify claims of superior virtue. They abuse Jim, verbally and physically, and some want to lynch him as an example to other slaves. The moderates among them, however, resist, pointing out that they could be made to pay for the destruction of private property. As Huck observes: ""the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right, is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him (Ch. 42). As if these enforcers of white supremacy did not appear contemptible enough already, Twain then has the doctor describe Jim as the best and most faithful nurse he has ever seen, despite Jim's ""resking his freedom"" and his obvious fatigue. These vigilantes do admit that Jim deserves to be rewarded, but their idea of a reward is to cease punching and cursing him. They are not even generous enough to remove Jim's heavy shackles. Ultimately, Huckleberry Finn renders a harsh judgment on American society. Freedom from slavery, the novel implies, is not freedom from gratuitous cruelty; and racism, like romanticism, is finally just an elaborate justification which the adult counterparts of Tom Sawyer use to facilitate their exploitation and abuse of other human beings. Tom feels guilty, with good reason, for having exploited Jim, but his final gesture of paying Jim off is less an insult to Jim than it is Twain's commentary on Tom himself. Just as slaveholders believe that economic relations (ownership) can justify their privilege of mistreating other human beings, Tom apparently believes that an economic exchange can suffice as atonement for his misdeeds. Perhaps he finds a forty-dollar token more affordable than an apology. But then, just as Tom could only ""set a free nigger free,"" considering, as Huck says, ""his bringing-up"" (Ch. 42), he similarly could hardly be expected to apologize for his pranks. Huck, by contrast, is equally rich, but he has apologized to Jim earlier in the novel. And this is the point of Huck's final remark, rejecting the prospect of civilization. To become civilized is not just to become like Aunt Sally. More immediately, it is to become like Tom Sawyer.

Jim is, indeed, ""as free as any creatur that walks this earth."" In other words, he is a man, like all men, at the mercy of other men's arbitrary cruelties. In a sense, given Twain's view of freedom, to allow Jim to escape to the North or to have Tom announce Jim's manumission earlier would be an evasion of the novel's ethical insights. While one may escape from legal bondage, there is no escape from the cruelties of this ""civilization."" There is no promised land, where one may enjoy absolute personal freedom. An individual's freedom is always constrained by one's social relations to other people. Being legally free does not spare Jim from gratuitous humiliation and physical suffering in the final chapters, precisely because Jim is still regarded as a ""nigger."" Even if he were as accomplished as the mulatto from Ohio, he would not be exempt from mistreatment. Furthermore, since Tom represents the hegemonic values of his society, Jim's ""freedom"" amounts to little more than an obligation to live by his wits and to make the best of a bad situation.

Slavery and racism, then, are social evils which take their places alongside various others which the novel documents, such as the insane romanticism that inspires the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons blithely to murder each other, generation after generation. Twain rejects entirely the mystification of race and demonstrates that Jim is in most ways a better man than the men who regard him as their inferior. But he also shows how little correlation there may be between the treatment one deserves and the treatment one receives.

If this conclusion sounds uncontroversial from the perspective of 1984, we would do well to remember that it contradicts entirely the overwhelming and optimistic consensus of 1884. And no other nineteenth-century novel so effectively locates racial discourse within the context of a general critique of American institutions and traditions. Indeed, the novel suggests that real individual freedom, in this land of the free, cannot be found. ""American civilization"" enslaves and exploits rather than liberates. It is hardly an appealing message.

Given the subtlety of Mark Twain's approach, it is not surprising that most of his contemporaries misunderstood or simply ignored the novel's demystification of race. Despite their patriotic rhetoric, they, like Pap, were unprepared to take seriously the implications of ""freedom, justice, and equality."" They, after all, espoused an ideology and an explicit language of race which was virtually identical to Thomas Jefferson's. Yet racial discourse flatly contradicts and ultimately renders hypocritical the egalitarian claims of liberal democracy. The heart of Twain's message to us is that an honest person must reject one or the other. But hypocrisy, not honesty, is our norm. For too many of us continue to assert both racial distinction and liberal values, simultaneously. If we, a century later, continue to be confused about Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, perhaps it is because we remain more deeply committed to both racial discourse and a self-deluding optimism than we care to admit.

Notes

1. The literature on the Abolition movement and on antebellum debates regarding the Negro is, of course, voluminous. George Fredrickson's excellent The Black Image in the White Mind is perhaps the best general work of its kind. Fredrickson's The Inner Civil War is also valuable, especialy pp. 53-64. Leon Litwack closely examines the ambivalence of Abolitionists regarding racial intermingling (214-46). Benjamin Quarles presents the most detailed examination of black Abolitionists, though Vincent Harding offers a more vivid (and overtly polemical) account of their relationships to white Abolitionists (101-194).

2. The debate over Jefferson's relationship to Sally Hemings has raged for two centuries. The most thorough scholarly accounts are by Fawn Brodie, who suggests that Jefferson did have a prolonged involvement with Hemings, and by Virginius Dabney, who endeavors to exonerate Jefferson of such charges. Barbara Chase-Riboud presents a fictionalized version of this relationship in Sally Hemings. The first Afro-American novel, Clotel; Or the President's Daughter (1853) by William Wells Brown, was also based on this alleged affair.

3. For dates of composition, see Blair. For a discussion of Melville's treatment of race, Carolyn Karchner's Shadow Over the Promised Land is especially valuable. Articles on Benito Cereño by Joyce Adler and Jean Yellin are also noteworthy. Rayford Logan and Lawrence J. Friedman provide detailed accounts of the racist climate in Post-Reconstruction America, emphasizing the literary manifestations of such attitudes. Friedman's discussion of George Washington Cable (99-118), the outspoken Southern liberal, is very informative. For a general historical overview of the period, C. Vann Woodward's work remains unsurpassed. John W. Cell offers a provocative reconsideration of Woodward's arguments, and Joel Williamson's new book documents the excessively violent tendencies of Southern racism at the end of the century.

4. My use of ""racial discourse"" has some affinities to Foucault's conception of ""discourse."" This is not, however, a strictly Foucaultian reading. While Foucault's definition of discursive practices provides one of the most sophisticated tools presently available for cultural analysis, his conception of power seems to me problematic. I prefer an account of power which allows for a consideration of interest and hegemony. Theorists such as Marshall Berman (34-35) and Catherine MacKinnon (526) have indicated similar reservations. Frank Lentriccia, however, has made a provocative attempt to modify Foucaultian analysis, drawing upon Gramsci's analysis of hegemony. See Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, Power/ Knowledge (esp. 92-108), and The History of Sexuality, (esp. 92-102).

5. This is not to discount the sufferings of other groups. But historically, the philosophical basis of Western racial discourse- which existed even before the European ""discovery"" of America- has been the equation of ""good"" and ""evil"" with light and darkness (or, white and black.) (See Derrida; Jordan, 1-40; and West, 47-65). Economically, the slave trade, chattel slavery, agricultural peonage, and color-coded wage differentials have made the exploitation of African-Americans the most profitable form of racism. Finally, Afro- Americans have long been the largest American ""minority"" group. Consequently, the primacy of ""the Negro"" in American racial discourse is, to use Althusser's term (87-126), ""Overdetermined."" The acknowledgment of primary status, however, is hardly a claim of privilege.

6. Even the allegedly scientific works on the Negro focused on superstition as a definitive trait. See, for example, W. D. Weatherford and Jerome Dowd. No one has commented more scathingly on Negro superstition than William H. Thomas, who was, by American definitions, a Negro himself.

7. Hoffman in Form and Fable (331) reveals an implicit understanding of Jim's creativity, but he does not pursue the point in detail.

8. This term became a part of the official military vocabulary during the Civil War, referring to a slave who had gone ""AWOL.""

9. A number of works comment on Twain's religious views and the relation between his critiques of religion and of racism. See Ensor; Pettit, ""Mark Train and the Negro""; and Gollin.

10. I would like to thank my colleagues, David Langston and Michael Bell, for the helpful suggestions which they offered to me regarding this essay.

Lane Boytwenty one pilots,"[Chorus]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain an' darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless, honest
There's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want an' what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows

[Chorus]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love an' me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless

[Chorus]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)

They be alive tomorrow?

They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""

But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway

Go Big Or Go HomeAmerican Authors,"[Verse 1]
Don't feel like going home
But all my cash is gone
Yeah, I got nothing to do tonight
I'm passed out on the floor
Up in the hotel bar
But it don't matter, cause I'm feeling fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking life's too short; it's passing by
So if I'm gonna go at all
Go big or go

I gave the dice a roll
And then we lost control
You know we're lucky that we survived
Cause when we jumped the ship
Oh, man, that boat, it flipped
But we should do it all again tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking life's too short; it's passing by
So if we're gonna go at all
Go big or go

Staying out, don't need no sleep
I'll sleep when I'm dead; you can bury me

I guess I'm going home
Cause all my cash is gone
I spent it all trying to feel alive

Doubttwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]

Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no
You are all that I’ve got, no

Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted
Want the markings made on my skin
To mean something to me again
Hope you haven't left without me
Hope you haven't left without me, please

[Verse 1]
When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way
Right time wrong place
As I pled my case

Three lights are lit
But the fourth one's out
I can tell cause it's a bit darker
Than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought
Of light bulbs in this house
So I head out
Down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions
And I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections
And I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out
And now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking
'Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house.'

FirstCold War Kids,"[Verse 1]
Cheated and lied, broken so bad
You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair
They're all the same, who can compare?
First you lose trust, then you get worried
Night after night, bar after club
Dropping like flies, who woke you up?
On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on
It's not your house, where'd you go wrong?
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

[Chorus]
Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

[Verse 2]
There comes a time, in a short life
Turn it around, get a re-write
Call it a dark night of the soul
Ticking of clocks, gravity's pull
First you get close, then you get worried

Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

You're going silent, the silent treatment
It's not inviting now
Don't deny what you meant
You get excited, you get excited
You got a feeling, or at least you can pretend
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends
You get excited, you get excited

Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first

First you get close, then you get worried

And oh babe, can you tell what’s on my tongue?
Can you guess that I’ll be gone?

It might as well have been a thousand

Round and round, round and round again
Or we could leave it all tonight
Leave it all just leave it all

But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
Cause I just want to hold you tight

Jekyll And HydeFive Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]

There's just so much God damned weight on your shoulders
That you can't just live your motherfucking life
The story's getting old and my heart is getting colder
I just wanna be Jekyll, but I'm always fighting Hyde
You've got rocks in your head, I can hear them rolling 'round
You can say that you're above it, but you're always falling down
Is there a method to your madness? Is it all about pride?
Everyone I know, they've got a demon inside

The Divine ZeroPierce The Veil,"[Verse 1]
Maybe I could swim into your thoughts like your drugs do
Paralyze your body, sick and tired of waking up to
Burning eyes and cigarettes
I’m falling through the couch like a suicide mission tonight
My God, here comes the downside
Wild eyes of terror pray for sex on the beach
While oceans of kerosene will soak into me
I'm not meant for this world, I just don't see the point
Don’t think about it, don’t over think about it
And life is a joke, but everything’s riding on me tonight
Been counting the stars and scars
How I’m becoming a work of art

[Chorus]
Desperate times and desperate measures
I come so close, my hopes are severed by the downside
A million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile

[Verse 2]
The whispered words “You’d better hide the bullets”
You stayed on the phone and talked to me day and night
Trigger my nightmare once again
It’s fucking loaded in hand
And we’ll let the fire rage
The smoke and the drowning flames
My bedroom computer light is the only menace to my new faux wooden blinds

[Chorus]
Desperate times and desperate measures
I come so close, my hopes are severed by the downside
A million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile

[Bridge]
Now, I only pray when it all goes down
I’ll be surrounded by all of the ones I've loved and cared about
And then burn it down

[Verse 3]
And life is a joke
At least I can love you, naked and tattooed
Counting the stars and scars
And if the pain is a sound, let’s slow it down

Desperate times and desperate measures
I come so close, my hopes are severed by the downside
A million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile

Now, I only pray when it all goes down

All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only looking up when my head’s down
All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only looking up when my head’s down

Well I guess I wanted, I guess I wanted
I just want you to know

Hey little monster, I got my eye on you
Where are you going, where you running to?
Hey little monster, you know it's all ok
I'm gonna love ya, no matter what you say

Where've you been hiding? And can I come this time?
So pleased to please ya, and rip that heart off your sleeve

Could Have Been MeThe Struts,"[Verse 1]
Don't wanna live as an untold story
Rather go out in a blaze of glory
I can't hear you, I don't fear you
I'll live now 'cause the bad die last
Dodging bullets with your broken past

Nobody Praying For MeSeether,"[Verse 1]
I'm a whisper lost upon wind
I'm the ember that will burn you down
I'm the water that will drown you
I'm a star that's just a black hole now
I'm a terrifying danger
I'm a fruit decaying on the ground
I'm a swallower of anger
I'm the tree that falls that makes no sound
I make no sound

[Chorus]
Cause if I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

[Verse 2]
I am fungus in the forest
I'm a lizard with a poisoned tongue
I'm the child in the manger
I'm the one who sacrificed his son
Rust is showing on my armor
I am wheezing like an old man done
I'm a product of my anger
I'm the bullet in a loaded gun

[Chorus]
Stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

Cause if I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold

LydiaHighly Suspect,"[Verse 1]
Black ocean, cold and dark
I am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
But the only girl that could talk to him just couldn't swim
Tell me what's worse than this
And it echoes in the halls
They danced along the walls
The memories of your ghost
You are the one that I used to love
And I'm still in love, but I've never loved you the most

[Chorus 1]
I've seen better days
So unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe

[Verse 2]
You gave me everything you had
Every little thing you had
A pure love unrehearsed
I've seen your best and worst
And at your worst, you're still the best
But at my best, I am the worst
It's a curse
Your eyes are lined in pain
Black tears don't hide in rain
And I tied you to the tracks
When I turned around, I heard the sound
I hit the ground, I know there's no turning back

[Chorus 2]
I've seen better days
So unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe the truth
Better days, so unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe the truth

[Verse 3]
Black ocean, cold and dark
I am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
But the only girl that could talk to him, she couldn't swim
Tell me what's worse than this
What's worse is all the coke
The ice, it numbs my throat if only for the night
My muscles will contract, your bones will crack
It's just a fact 'cause I am here to win this fight

[Chorus 3]
I can't fucking breathe, much less believe the truth
I pick up a gun, aim for the sun, and shoot
Better days, so unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe or believe the truth

Your eyes are lined in pain
Black tears don't hide in rain
And I tied you to the tracks
When I turned around, I heard that sound"
JennyNothing More,"[Verse 1]
A little sleep, a little slumber
A little folding of the hands
Left you weak, left you hungry
When there's supply you still demand
You're beginning to drag the ones you love down
Will this phase ever end?
A thousand arms to hold you
But you won't reach for any hands
'Cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't feel like I'm getting through to you
Let me paint this clear
Life is short, my dear
See your mother here
Her last painful year
I wish you only knew
She stuck around for you

Maybe you should just fall
And Leave the world and lose it all
And if that's what you need
To finally see
I'll be with you through it all​

Bring on the pills, roll the dollar bill
Medicating will never heal
Relapse, rehab, repeat
Always thinking about the me, me, me
Self-destruct, spiral down
Until your want becomes your need
Please get up like I know you can
Or forever love the fall
'Cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't feel like I'm getting through to you

Strung out, off the wagon, and unwound
But steady, steady, oh God, Jenny, Jenny

Bear to hear the sound
Of your body, body hitting the ground
I can't stand to see you down
Strung out, off the wagon, and unwound
But steady, steady, oh God, Jenny, Jenny
I can't bear to hear the sound
Of your body, body hitting the ground

The Vengeful OneDisturbed,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation I cannot forget

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Verse 2]
As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Bridge]
When you die
You'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die
You'll know why

You'll die
You'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die
You'll know why

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

FootstepsPop Evil,"[Verse one]
I've been counting all my steps
All my no's just turned to yes
Silently I must confess
My troubled history
That's washed away all my sins
Starting over once again
This is where it all begins
It's right in front of me
Down is not where I belong
This aching heart won't turn to stone
There's a fire inside these bones
It was meant to be
I see your world's still full of light
How could I ever been so blind
I still haven't lost my fight
That haunts me in my sleep

I feel like waking up
I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps
Go higher, go higher
I've walked an empty mile
Wore down this lonely soul

Higher, go higher

I know only time would tell
If all the cards will treat me well
Cause this hand that I been dealt
Keeps me wondering
So now here I turn the page
I've learned to silence all my rage
Tell me who can really say
What will tomorrow bring

I've had this dream before

Go higher, go higher

Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
Take a back seat, or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones

Bring you down

Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze

Well hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot

And I remember, I remember when the neon used to burn so bright and pink
Saturday night kind of pink!

GravityPapa Roach,"[Verse 1: Jacoby Shaddix]
I was there on the day truth died
Blood on my hands throw 'em up in the sky
I was the number one sinner, no less
My life was a lie, and my wish was a death
I fell in love with the ways of the world
Money, the fame, the booze, the girls
But I couldn't stay faithful, if I tried
I turned in to a devil, you could see it in my eyes
I blacked out, told everything I ever did
I couldn't take all the lies I was living with
I broke your heart, woke up the next day
My bags outside, yelling, ""Get the hell away!
You're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
And you can't never change all the things that you did!""
That's when I knew it, it wouldn't last
You never get away, when you're running from the past

[Chorus: Maria Brink/Jacoby Shaddix]
I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

[Verse 2: Jacoby Shaddix]
I'm a broken man, I'm full of sin
I'm sick of all this hell that I'm living in
And I can't escape it, this is how it feels
When you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
You tore me down, wished that I was dead
Said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
But when I push away, you only pull me closer
It's only over when we both wanna say it's over
I gotta change this is not who I am
I wanna start over wanna try this again
You're everything I need, everything I'm not
So pull the trigger, give me one more shot

[Chorus: Maria Brink/Jacoby Shaddix]
I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

[Verse 3: Maria Brink]
You love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
You lifted me up just to watch as you broke me
You promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
No matter what you say, I don't know truth from the lies
I helped you up, like I always do
I forgave you for your sins and I carried you through them
No matter how hard we fought, we always knew
You will bleed for me, and I will bleed for you

[Bridge: Jacoby Shaddix]
Fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
Die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

We rise again and lose our gravity

The garden was blessed by the Gods of me and you
We headed west for to find ourselves some truth, ooh
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
We counted all our reasons, excuses that we made
We found ourselves some treasure, and threw it all away
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?

[Chorus]
When I dance alone, and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?

[Verse 2]
Caught in the tide of blossom, caught in the carnival
Your confidence forgotten, and I see the gypsies roll
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?

[Chorus]
When I dance alone, and the sun's beating down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?

[Bridge]
When I dance alone, and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
When I dance alone, I know I'll go
Blame it on me ooh
When I'll lose control, I know I'll go
Blame it on me ooh

What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?"

Let It HappenTame Impala,"[Verse 1]
It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
""Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen""

[Chorus 1]
All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

[Chorus 2]
All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my ticker fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry

[Bridge]
I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to bounce to it
All the while thinking I might as well do it
They be lovin' someone and I’m not that stupid
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it? And you wanna think that

[Outro]
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along"
KillpopSlipknot,"[Verse 1]
She's sticking needles in her skin, I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy
But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing, the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see
Will she ever find one million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely, but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world, no one hurts this pretty girl but her

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, she's beautiful, a little better than a man deserves
You are not insane, please tell me she won't change

[Chorus]
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me), oh

[Verse 2]
She's drowning in herself again, my God, what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do but have my way
She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers, it doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head, something tells me I'm the one who's kept

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, so volatile, a little better than a man defiled
Ooh, I need the pain, please tell me she won't change

[Chorus]
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me), oh

True FriendsBring Me The Horizon,"[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front

[Verse 1]
It's funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start
But I couldn't even see the forest for the trees

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid you asked for this
You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you

You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know

[Verse 2]
It's kind of sad, 'cause what we had, well, it coulda been somethin'
I guess it wasn't meant to be
So how dare you, try and steal my flame just 'cause yours faded
Well, hate is gasoline, a fire fueling all my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid you asked for this
You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

Wasn't Expecting ThatJamie Lawson,"[Verse 1]
It was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that
Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could have missed
I wasn't expecting that
Did I mis-read the sign
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that
You spent the night in my bed
You woke up and you said
""I wasn't expecting that""

[Chorus]
I thought love wasn't meant to last
I thought you were just passing through
If i ever get the nerve to ask
What did i get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that

[Verse 2]
It was only a word
It was almost mis-heard
I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't expecting that

[Chorus]
I thought love wasn't meant to last
Honey, I thought you were just passing through
If i ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that

[Bridge]
Oh isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed

[Verse 3]
If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
I wasn't expecting that
When the nurses they came
Said ""it's come back again""
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by surprise
I wasn't expecting that"
Follow YouBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
My head is hauntin' me and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel somethin', 'cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side
Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I'm your one-man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side

'Cause I'm tellin' you, you're all I need
I promise you, you're all I see
'Cause I'm tellin' you, you're all I need

So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you

Come sink into me and let me breathe you in
I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen
So dig two graves, 'cause when you die
I swear I'll be leaving by your side

[Chorus]
So you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you so you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand

So you can drag me through hell

DoomedBring Me The Horizon,"[That's The Spirit Tour Extended Intro]
Sometimes I wonder why are we all here
Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear
To why I bother, why I try
Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die
I lost my wife this year, we lost our friend
Always fighting battles, but it never seems to end
Are we just ladders in this world of snakes?
'Cause if life is one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna play
So come and sing, sing me asleep
I dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deep
Cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed
D'you want salvation? Well, I'm sorry, we are all doomed

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my

[Verse 2]
The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kicked the chair, but we
We helped tie the rope
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my

[Pre-Chorus]
So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth savin'
So come rain on my parade

[Chorus]
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now, there's no way back

[Verse 3]
You must've made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead, I'm awake
The Devil told me, ""No room for cheats""
I thought I'd sold my soul, but he kept the receipt

[Bridge]
So leave a light on, I'm comin' home
It's gettin' darker, but I'll carry on
The sun don't shine but it never did
And when it rains, it fuckin' pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the mess, I think I like it

[Pre-Chorus]
So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth savin'
So come rain on my parade

[Chorus]
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now, there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now, there's no way back

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth savin'
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed

OutsideFoo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
There you are dancing at your altar
Beautiful earthling, dressed in kashmir
All of your sound echoes through the canyons
Down below they're dreaming
Hear the sirens screaming
Another time, another world
Girls were boys and boys were girls
Find the glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move
Everybody needs some room
There's something out there

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside — of me

[Verse 2]
Oh, I found the space between the spaces
Standing in the nothing, and time reclaims you
And as the wind will beat you down
And the wind the only sound
There's something out there

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside — of me

There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside — of me"
Song For SomeoneU2,"[Verse 1]
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

[Chorus 1]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

[Verse 2]
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there it's yours to take

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

[Chorus 2]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, this is a song for someone

[Outro]
And I'm a long long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out"
Circlesmachineheart,"[Verse 1]
If you're looking for a diamond
You gotta sift through the gold
If you're searching for a way out
You gotta take the new road
If you don't keep the motion moving
It can all feel the same
In the heart of the city
Where the streets are the veins

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, when I'm runnin' low
Oh, when the river's dry
Oh, can you help me go on?

[Chorus]
One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna, run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time, pull me in a circle, circle
Circle, pull me in a circle, circle, circle

[Verse 2]
Oh, I know this is heavy
Like a weight on your back
But I think that we can carry
Carry on to the last
And we're laughing and crying oceans
At the smallest of things
But I feel so much better
When we find the release

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, like a broken light
Oh, in the blackest night
Oh, can you flip the switch on?

[Chorus]
One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna, run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time, pull me in a circle, circle
Circle, pull me in a circle, circle, circle

[Bridge]
I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
And it's never in the knowing
It's in the not giving in
And when the earth is slippin', trippin'
But underneath that fear
Remember we're not finished
We're not finished

[Chorus]
One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna, run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time, pull me in a circle, circle
Circle, pull me in a circle, circle, circle

[Chorus]
One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna, run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it

The OthersideRed Sun Rising,"[Verse 1]
I know I'm not as hot as the flame that burned here before me
I've been flipping through all your moments and tearing out memories

[Pre-Chorus]
How long how long can you carry this note
How low, how low can we keep digging this hole
Until we come out on the other side

[Chorus]
Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone

Trying to wash all of my sins clean
I've gotten too filthy
The drain is full but still circles beneath me
Like a fool to sanity

How long how long can you carry this note
How low, how low can we keep digging this hole
Until we come out on the other side

Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone

Will you come out alone
Will you come out at all
Will you come out alone

When you come out on the other side

Dug My HeartBORNS,"[Verse 1]
You dug my heart a grave
I watched you illustrate the expression of another lonely girl
And there you lie awake
And wish you knew a way to fade the blaring silence from your only world

And now you're running to the sound of the light
Running to the sound of the light

Just to make room for any
Thoughts of caressin' your sweet

MoleculesAtlas Genius,"[Verse 1]
We steal the molecules from the dead
We liberate inanimate objects
Is this a path of will up ahead?
Or are we just destined to get what we get?

[Pre-Chorus]
Drawn to your face like never before
Even the mistakes aren't really mistakes at all

I wanna confess that you own me
And we don't rest if we're lonely
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive

[Verse 1]
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2]
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom

And I'm in love with being queen

DemonsImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"
Let Her GoPassenger,"[Produced by Mike Rosenberg and Chris Vallejo]
[Video by Dave Jensen and Tavic]

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

[Hook]
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go..."
Sweater WeatherThe Neighbourhood,"[Verse 1]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you
Now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats

Now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

[Verse 2]
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?

[Verse 2]
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?

We danced with monsters through the night

Do I Wanna Know?Arctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

From time to time I pinch myself
Because I think my girl
Mistakes me for somebody else
And every time she takes my hand
All the wonders that remain
Become a simple fact

[Chorus]
Cause you were out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me

Love Don't DieThe Fray,"[Co-written & co-produced by Ryan Tedder]

[Verse 1]
If I know one thing that's true
It ain't what you say, it's what you do
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But I listen when you do

[Interlude 1]
A thousand years go by
But love don't die

[Verse 2]
If I know one thing that's true
It's that I'm never leaving you
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But I lose it when you do

[Interlude 2]
Don't let them tell no lies
Love don't die

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die

[Verse 3]
If there is one thing that's true
It's not what I say, it's what I do
And I say too much, yeah, that's true
So just listen to what I do

[Interlude 1]
A thousand years go by
But love don't die

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die

[Bridge]
You can break it up, you can burn it down
You can box it in, bury it in the ground
You can close it off, can turn it away
Try to keep it down six feet in the ground
But love don't die

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die"
I See FireEd Sheeran,"[Intro]
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

[Outro]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside"
Tennis CourtLorde,"[Produced by Joel Little]

[Verse 1]
Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again, well, I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form, showing people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm known?
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)

[Bridge]
It looked all right in the pictures (Yeah)
Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it? (Yeah)
I'll fall apart, with all my heart (Yeah)
And you can watch from your window (Yeah)
And you can watch from your window

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)

[Outro]
And talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
And talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
And talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
And talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like ""yeah"" (Yeah)"
Come A Little CloserCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
Time shakes, found you at the water
At first you were my father, now I love you like a brother
Earthquakes shake the dust behind you
This world at times will blind you
Still I know I'll see you there

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been seeing?
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming?
Come a little closer, then you'll see

[Verse 2]
Heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders
Will we burn on or just smolder?
Somehow I know I'll find you there
Oooh, you wanna see if you can change it, change it
Still I know I'll see you there

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Do you understand the things that you've been seeing?
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming?
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see

[Bridge]
Ten thousand people stand alone now
And in the evening the sun sank
Tomorrow it will rise
""Time flies by,"" they all sang along
""Time flies by,"" they all sang along
""Time flies by,"" they all sang along
""Time flies by... by""

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see"
Come To MeGoo Goo Dolls,"[Verse 1]
I'll be kind, if you'll be faithful
You be sweet and I'll be grateful
Cover me with kisses, dear
Lighten up the atmosphere
Keep me warm inside our bed
I got dreams of you all through my head
Fortune teller said I'd be free
And that's the day you came to me, mm
Came to me, mm
Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo

[Chorus]
Come to me, my sweetest friend
Can you feel my heart again?
I'll take you back where you belong
And this will be our favorite song
Come to me with secrets bare
I'll love you more so don't be scared
And when we're old and near the end
We'll go home and start again

[Verse 2]
I caught you burnin' photographs
Like that could save you from your past
History is like gravity
It holds you down away from me
You and me, we've both got sins
I don't care about where you've been
Don't be sad and don't explain
This is where we start again, mm
Start again, mm
Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo

Come to me, my sweetest friend

We'll go home and start again
Start again
Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo

[Bridge]
Today's the day I'll make you mine
So get me to the church on time
Take my hand in this empty room
You're my girl, and I'm your groom
Come to me, my sweetest friend
This is where we start again, again

[Chorus]
Come to me, my sweetest friend
Can you feel my heart again?
I'll take you back where you belong
And this will be our favorite song
Come to me with secrets bare
I'll love you more so don't be scared
When we're old and near the end
We'll go home and start again
Start again
Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo

SirensPearl Jam,"[Intro]
Hear the sirens, hear the sirens

[Verse 1]
Hear the sirens, hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bed
Just to know we’re safe, I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear

[Chorus 1]
Oh, had to take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn’t care, before you were here
I danced in laughter, with the ever after
But all things change, let this remain

[Verse 2]
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?
For every choice, mistake I made it's not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I’ll wait, I’ll understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, it’s a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much, I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace, by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
It’s a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much, I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace, by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away

[Outro]
The fear goes away, the fear goes away
The fear goes away"
Miss JacksonPanic! At The Disco,"[Intro: LOLO]
Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson

[Verse 1: Brendon Urie]
You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky, kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life (no one's gonna find out)
A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (in your nightgown)

[Pre-Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty?
I love her anyway
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie]
Way down until the fire finally dies out
You've got them wrapped around your finger, watch them fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out
Let me say it one more time (tragic in the fall out)

[Pre-Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty?
I love her anyway
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn
But I love her any--

[Bridge: LOLO (Brendon Urie)]
Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty?
I love her anyway
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn

AfraidThe Neighbourhood,"[Intro]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place

[Verse 1]
Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paid junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?
All my friends always lie to me, I know they're thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)

[Verse 2]
Keep on dreaming, don't stop breathing, fight those demons
Sell your soul, not your whole self
Oh, if they see it when you're sleeping, make them leave it
And I can't even see if there's hope there, anymore
So

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)

[Bridge]
Being me can only mean feeling scared to breathe
If you leave me, then I'll be afraid of everything
That makes me anxious, gives me patience
Calms me down, lets me face this, let me sleep
And when I wake up, let me be

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me

Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers

Got a lot to not do, lemme kill it with you

A Light That Never ComesLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(Oh, oh)
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

(Oh, oh)
A night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I've been waiting for it, so long

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
There comes that day it's off with his head

A night gets darkest, right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then, when you're gone

Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Waiting for a light that never comes

That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

Glory And GoreLorde,"[Produced by Joel Little]

[Verse 1]
There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious

[Verse 2]
Delicate in every way but one (The swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (The old ways)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious

[Bridge]
No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises: we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's all right if you do, it's fine
We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain:
""Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?""
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious"
The WireHAIM,"[Verse 1: Danielle Haim]
You know I'm bad at communication
It's the hardest thing for me to do
And it's said it's the most important part
That relationships go through
And I gave it all away, just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Verse 2: Danielle Haim]
You know there's no rhyme or reason
For the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind
Not intentionally
I know it's hard to hear me say it
But I can't bear to stay in
I just know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Danielle Haim]
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled, and when it came down to the wire

It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled, and when it came down to the wire
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled, and when it came down to the wire

[Verse 3: Alana Haim]
No need to use your imagination
Try and make it what you want it to be
Because I'm sorry I did what I did, but
It came naturally
And I gave it all away just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Verse 4: Este Haim]
When I tried to keep myself together
After all the opportunities
I tried to stay true to you
And I tried to do what you wanted from me
And I gave it all away just to hear you say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway (Hey!)

Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it

[Bridge: Danielle Haim]
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled, and when it came down to the wire
Ooh, yeah
But I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled, and when it came down to the wire

[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled, and when it came down to the wire
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled, and when it came down to the wire
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
Oh, but I fumbled, and when it
Came down to the wire, yeah, yeah, yeah

The Mother We ShareCHVRCHES,"[Verse 1]
Never took your side, never cursed your name
I keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-o-oh
And we've come as far as we’re ever gonna get
Until you realise, that you should go-o-o-oh

[Chorus]
Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

[Verse 2]
In the dying light, I’m the only one here
And I will cover you, until you go-o-o-oh
'Cause if I told the truth, I would always be free
And keep a prize with me, until you go-o-o-oh

[Chorus]
Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

[Bridge]
Into the night, for once, we’re the only ones left
I bet you even know, where we could go-o-o-oh
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands
It’s a souvenir for when you go-o-o-oh

[Chorus]
Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling"
Dirty PawsOf Monsters And Men,"[Verse 1]
Jumping up and down the floor
My head, is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn

The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

[Verse 2]
Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees

The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

[Refrain]
La la la
La la la, la
La la la
La la la, la

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
So for a while, things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines

But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws

Battle BornFive Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I swore I had a heart
Long before the world I know
Tore it all apart
Once upon a time
There was apart of me I shared
Years before they took away
The part of me that cared

[Chorus]
I've been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm going
But I know just where I've been
I've flown a million miles
And I rode so many more
Everyday a castaway
A vagabond battle born
A battle born

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time
I had an open point of view
But that was just so long ago
Before I had a clue
Was there such a time
Where I didn't stand alone
Was there ever a time
And how would I of known

Shepherd Of FireAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See I have pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of being damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own

I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell you who not to be

But I'm a dealer of simple choices

HallelujahMatthew Schuler,"I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who has seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress; take a shot now

Give the bruises out like gifts

I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers
Fill my dashboard just the same, ah, ah-ah

In the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing, and love it

I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days there was enough
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
I was in but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free

Go get punched for the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's somethin' about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too ill
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sittin' pretty on the throne, there's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again

Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member, go on your great adventure again

AtlasColdplay,"[Verse 1]
Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow
Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say ""oh""
We're about to explode

[Chorus]
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road
Show me the way, Lord
'Cause I, I'm about to explode

I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

Nothing MoreThe Alternate Routes,"To be humble, to be kind
It is the giving of the peace in your mind
To a stranger, to a friend...
To give in such a way that has no end
We are love
We are one
We are how we treat each other when the day is done
We are peace
We are war
We are how we treat each other and nothing more
To be bold, to be brave;
It is the thinking that the heart can still be saved
And the darkness can come quick;
The Danger's in the Anger and the hanging on to it
We are love
We are one
We are how we treat each other when the day is done
We are peace
We are war
We are how we treat each other and nothing more
Tell me what it is that you see
A world that's filled with endless possibilities?
Heroes don't look they used to, they look like you do
We are love
We are one
We are how we treat each other when the day is done
We are peace
We are war
We are how we treat each other and nothing more
We are how we treat each other and nothing more
We are how we treat each other"
Have Yourself A Merry Little ChristmasCat Power,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in golden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together and
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now"
It's About TimeYoung The Giant,"[Verse 1]
All the kids are throwing sticks
Politics
Nights on the wire
Everybody wants to get by
It's a test of the times
A test of my rights
It's on pretty lady
Born to be angry
Grip of the vice
Click on the trigger, girl
Sip wine on ice
It's about time
Best to rewind
You better blow
(Pistols, pistols, pistols)

Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tight rope
Don't go
It's about time, It's about time

[Verse 2]
Everybody come on
Lights on the beaches
Everybody come on, delight
Close the front door
I don't wanna go
Like I'm on the ""Truman Show""
Best to let go
You don't wanna know
You better blow

[Chorus]

All the years of paradise
Paradigms
Paralyze us
You're crazy
All the cards you've organized
Shuffled twice in front of my eyes
Everybody has
Needs, wants, a cold gun

Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed

Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go

Go alone, my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones, alone, my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning
They'll nosh you up, yes, they'll nosh the love away
But it's fair to say, you will still haunt me

Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go

On Top Of The WorldImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you

Sleeping With A FriendNeon Trees,"[Verse 1]
All my friends, they’re different people
Anxious like the ocean in a storm
When we go out, yeah, we’re electric
Coursing through our bodies ’til we’re one

And why mess up a good thing, baby?
It’s a risk to even fall in love
So, when you give that look to me
I better look back carefully
‘Cause this is trouble, yeah this is trouble

[Hook]
I said ooh, ooh
You got me in the mood, mood
I’m scared, but if my heart’s gonna break
Before the night will end
I said, ooh, ooh we’re in danger
Sleeping with a friend, sleeping with a friend
Sleeping with a friend

[Verse 2]
All my friends, stay up past midnight
Looking for the thing to fill the void
I don’t go out much like I used to
Something ’bout the strangers and the noise

And why leave when I got you, baby?
It’s a risk but babe, I need the thrill
I never said you’d be easy
But if it was all up to me
I’d be no trouble, hey, we’re in trouble

I said ooh, ooh
You got me in the mood, mood
I’m scared, but if my heart’s gonna break

Well, I see you standing there like a rabid dog
And you got those crying eyes
Makes me wanna surrender and wrap you in my arms
You know I try to live without regrets
I'm always moving forward and not looking back
But I tend to leave a trail of dead while I'm moving ahead

And when my fear pulls me out to sea
And the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies

Just like an animal, I protect my pride
When I'm too bruised to fight
And even when I'm wrong, I tend to think I'm right

Well, I'm bored of the game
And too tired to rage

Pour a little salt, we were never here

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

In the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be balanced

And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?

Take Out The GunmanChevelle,"Awoke
When the light
Hit me right in the temple
Felt something cold
Touch my toes as it passed

Might not be
The face you'd expect
But he's clearly insane
Got me pegged in the back

Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
Take out the knees
Had to choose
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Eyes
Huge
So little left if something
Cracks and clues
He's crazy as a straw
Why... Denied... Does no one care or nothing
How, they ask, I ever last so long

Cause I, I went blind
A blinding riot
He's regretting every word

Those empty lies
One more tonight
My blinding riot
As I summon every nerve

Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun

More than you let me be
I’m more than you know
A body in a soul
You don’t see me but you will
I am not invisible

(That's right
I’ll be in the invisible world)

I don’t dream, not as such
I don’t even think about you that much
Unless I start to think at all

All those frozen days
And your frozen ways
They melt away your face like snow

[Chorus]
I’m more than you know
I’m more than you see here
I’m more than you let me be
I’m more than you know
A body in a soul
You don’t see me but you will
I am not invisible
I am here

[Outro]
There is no them
There is no them
There’s only us
There’s only us
There is no them
There is no them
There’s only us
There’s only us
There is no them
There is no them
There’s only you
And there’s only me
There is no them"
Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?Arctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Bridge]
An' I can't see you here, wonderin' where  am I
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
An' you're startin' to bore me, baby
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Outro]
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?"""
R U Mine?Arctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

[Bridge]
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, ""You got me, baby
Are you mine?""
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
(Or just mine tonight?)"
What If I Was NothingAll That Remains,"[Verse 1]
Just let it go
Don't wanna argue anymore
I can't be sure, I know just what we're fighting for
I know you're scared and that you're thinking I may go
I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinking I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothing, what if this is true?
What if I was nothing girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you girl, I'm nothing without you

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard, it seems we've worked at this so long
It's often foolish pride that tells us we're not wrong
I hear your voice, you tell me that you'll never go
And I believe it, I believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinking I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothing, what if this is true?
What if I was nothing girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you girl, I'm nothing without you

(Guitar Solo)

[Bridge]
And we can keep this going on
We'll make it work some way
And every step, it make us stronger every day

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinking I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothing, what if this is true?
What if I was nothing girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you girl, I'm nothing without you

[Chorus/Outro]
What if I was nothing, what if this is true? (What if I was nothing?)
What if I was nothing girl, nothing without you (What if I was nothing)
So what if I was angry, what did you think I'd do? (What if I was nothing)
I told you that I love you girl, I'm nothing without you"
Tonight You're PerfectNew Politics,"[Verse 1]
Should I believe in the world, momma?
Should I give up and hide or should I stay and fight?
Should I believe in the rules, momma?
Tell me if I should run or learn to shoot a gun

TiredStone Sour,"[Verse 1]
I'm alive in here, so alive in here, pulling down a little peace
I'm open wide in here, slow to rise in here, saving grace and killing me
You say this only makes me incomplete
I'm canceled out and rendered obsolete
Tell the mad chameleon he's not welcome anymore
I know what I'm looking for

[Chorus]
Somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know, I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me, I'm just too young to care

[Verse 2]
I can see in here and I can feel in here
Comatose with common sense
I take my time in here, somebody get me out of here
What am I so against?
I just want to watch the whole world burn
Lost a million times and I won't learn
Show me someone innocent, I'll show you there’s no proof
I may become, but I'm no fool

[Bridge]
I'm not close, I'm not safe
I don't know, don’t know, am I better off in chains?
The one is not aware
So stay away from me, I'm just too young to care

[Outro/Chorus]
I need somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know, I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me, I'm just too young to care
Too young to care"

We Might Be Dead By TomorrowSoko,"Give me all your love now
Cause for all we know
We might be dead by tomorrow

I can't go on wasting my time
Adding scars to my heart
Cause all I hear is ""I'm not ready enough""

And I can tell that you didn't have
To face your mother losing her lover
Without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Cause she didn't have time

I don't want to judge what's in your heart
But if you're not ready for love
How can you be ready for life?
How can you be ready for life?

So let's love fully and let's love loud
And let's love now
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die"
Best FriendFoster The People,"[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 1]
Feelings sleeping in the field again
But I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
Well, I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc

[Pre Chorus 1]
It dries up
I've been a spoken word, I've been a river bed, I've been a rabid force
And let it flow out from within
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh!

[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down

You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me

Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

Waves in theta slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel the celestial beings
Wilted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see, I can see the beauty in the mess

It dries up
I've been a river bed, I tried to salt the wound
I've carried more than I can
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Sometimes it feel like I only dream in black and white

No matter where you are
Sometimes you have to wait until it passes by
Like a satellite or star
No matter where you are

ForeverHAIM,"[Verse 1]
Hey you!
Remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, you took it all
You tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me
It isn't fair, to have your way
To try and get up and go
And na-na-na-na now, can't you see
It isn't fair, to have your way?
But I'm trying to get your attention
I need you to know that

Just another good reason to get it right

Guilty All The SameLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way
But oh, we all know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Show us all again, that our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need
Show us all again 'cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way
And oh, you will know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 3: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock
Till pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game, to me you're all the same
You're guilty

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same"

Don't get me started, love

Had too much time to think
So leave me alone
Crying when you're by yourself

Makes time go slow, slow, slow, yeah
Makes time go slow, slow, slow, slow

Something's gotta give soon
Or I'm gonna lose it
Substance abusing

Fall off the deep end

Ordinary LoveU2,"[Verse 1]
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore

Wants to find us again

I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze

We'll build our house in the trees

Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Are we tough enough

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love

If we can't deal with ordinary love"
I Wanna Get BetterBleachers,"[Verse 1]
Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television, and put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past 'cause
I froze in time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better

[Verse 2]
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind because the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

[Verse 3]
I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til i wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if it's gonna kill me

[Verse 4]
Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better

Yeah, a fine lady from Belize said ""You got the spirit of Fela""
Yeah, the young one dripping make-up lift her hands up to holla
Well, I gave her what I got but couldn't handle her broken heart

The right words in the hands of dissidents with the fire

The war machine will put out both its hands for a dollar
It's drinking at the table with the chrome hand guerrillas

The right things in the hands of dissidents with the fire

Give me a shot at the night, some kinda mysterious
Give me a shot at the night

Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious

House Of The Rising SunFive Finger Death Punch,"There is a house in Sin City
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in Sin City

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Well, I've got one foot on the platform
The other's on the train
I'm goin' back to Sin City
To wear that ball and chain

Well, mothers, tell your children
Never do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the rising sun

In the house of the rising sun

Well, there is a house in Sin City
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, knows that I, I'm one"
Pseudologia FantasticaFoster The People,"[Verse 1]
Faded and worn at the seams
A psychotropic wanderlust sick and laughing
Their words bared their teeth into the wall
I promised I would rid the world of feral animals

I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd off yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword?
Well, you'll fade out anyway

[Chorus]
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

[Verse 2]
Fill the air with what you like
Another weekend massacre of opinion
Don't be afraid of the knife
Sometimes you have to cut the limb to survive

I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd off yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword?
Well, you'll bleed out anyway

[Chorus]
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

You got to love the madness of the feeling
Don't have to rush the freshness of beginning
You got to get back up and face your demons
Don't ever be afraid of starting over"
Blue MoonBeck,"I'm so tired of being alone
These penitent walls are all I've known
The songbird calling
Across the water
Outside my silent asylum

Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone

[Refrain]
So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time

See the turncoat on his knees
The vagabond that no one sees
When that moon stole your shadows
You can't save the ones you caught in battle

Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone

Cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies you tried to hide
Behind your eyes

Don't leave me on my own
Don't leave me on my own

[Refrain]
So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time"

Not Gonna DieSkillet,"[Verse 1: John Cooper]
Death surrounds
My heartbeat’s slowing down
I won’t take this world’s abuse
I won’t give up, I refuse
This is how it feels when you’re bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity’s stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]
The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

[Verse 2: John Cooper]
Break their hold
Because I won’t be controlled
They can’t keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]
The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

[Bridge: John Cooper]
Don’t you give up on me
You’re everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back

[Guitar Solo: Seth Morrison]

[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

[Ending: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
No, we're not gonna die tonight
Not gonna die

And even God Herself has fewer plans than me
But she never helps me out with my scams for free, though
She grabs a stick and then she points it at me
When I say nothing, I say everything
Yeah, when I say nothing, I say everything

They threw me down in a lazaretto
Born rottin', bored rotten
Makin' models of people I used to know
Out of coffee and cotton

And all my illegitimate kids have begotten
Thrown down to the wolves, made feral for nothin'
Quarantined on the Isle of Man
And I'm trying to escape any way that I can, oh
Any way that I can, oh

Damn, I have no time left, time is lost
No time at all, throw it in a garbage can
And I shake God's hand
I jump up and let Her know when I can
This is how I'm gonna do it

They're lighting fires with the cash of the masses
And like the dough, I don't fall down

Don't give me up

How unfair, it's just our luck
Found something real that's out of touch

Staring at the ceiling

All the words that I always wish you would’ve said
All these dreams that we had now fade to black
Try to wash it away

I sit here in misery wondering if I’ll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be

[Verse 2]
Here I float through the air like a waterfall
Then I sink to the bottom like a cannonball
Having trouble breathing, suddenly I’m screaming
""Why wasn’t I good enough?""
Even though I know you’re not gonna come back
I can’t wash it away

[Hook]x2

[Bridge]
It’s tearing me to pieces
Tearing me to pieces
It’s tearing me to pieces
Tearing me to pieces

Even though I know you’re not coming back
I can’t wash it away

[Hook]

[Outro/Chorus]
I’m torn to pieces, I’m broken down
(I’m torn to pieces)
I still see your face when you’re not around
(I’m torn to pieces)
I sit here in misery wondering if I’ll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be"
I Don't Want To Be Here AnymoreRise Against,"On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall
We count the days scratching lines on the wall
Wait in the wings, at someone's beck and call

No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere, this fate, I lost control

We backed down
We took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around

I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore

I don't wanna be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here anymore

On hand and foot we answered every single call
And weathered every day like passing storms
But when we break we will all be gone

Won't back down
Won't take no for answers
Anymore these walls close
We pace back and forth

I don't wanna be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn
I don't wanna be here anymore

The point where we break
Gets closer everyday
But where do we go?
But where do we go?

I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore

I don't wanna be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here anymore, anymore"
Final MasqueradeLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
But we both keep on waiting, for what we left behind

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade"
PainkillerThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you,
Never gonna let you get away
The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

[Verse 2]
I know what you want so desperately
You know I'll give you one for free
Forever you're coming back to me
Now I'm gonna give you what you need
Cause I know what you feed on
And what you lean on
And what you lean on
The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

[Bridge]
Did you find another cure?
Did you find another cure?

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer"
Thunder ClatterWild Cub,"[Verse 1]
I see you hidden in the night I found you
I see you separate from the others
Bent crooked in the light around you
Bathing﻿ in the sight of the others

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it

[Chorus]
It was hidden in the fall
Hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call
Hidden in the fall

[Verse 2]
I met you in the dead of winter
I stood stranded in the water
Dug deeper than a crooked splinter
I turned away from all the others

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it

[Chorus]
It was hidden in the fall
Hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call
Hidden in the fall

[Verse 3]
Sad hopes I'd hidden under
Tangled inside of me
You spoke like broken thunder
Deep﻿ into the center of me

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it

[Chorus]
It was hidden in the fall
Hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call
Hidden in the fall

[Refrain/Outro]
I hear it call in the center of it all
You're the love of my life, the love of my life
I hear it all in the center of my heart
You're the love of my life, the love of my life
I hear it call in the center of it all
You're the love of my life, the love of my life
I hear it all in the center of my heart
You're the love of my life, the love of my life"
Snap Out Of ItArctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
What's been happenin' in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

[Verse 2]
Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settlin' down or givin' up
But it don't sound much like you, girl

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

[Bridge]
Under a spell, you're hypnotised (Ooh)
Darling, how could you be so blind? (Snap out of it)
Under a spell, you're hypnotised (Ooh)
Darling, how could you be so blind?

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to

BelieverAmerican Authors,"[Chorus]
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

[Verse 1]
I'm a little bit sheltered
I'm a little bit scared
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm going nowhere
I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go
No, and I don't wanna let it go
I'm a little bit angry, when everyone's around
But I get a little lonely, when no one's out
I feel my demons misleading me

[Chours]
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

[Verse 2]
Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
The weights off my shoulders it was bringing me down (down)
I've never been that lucky I've never tasted fame (fame)
I'm always looking for something but I hate changin'
Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

[Chorus]
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

[Hook]
It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinning and it won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there
'Cause time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

[Chorus]
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

This Means WarAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
Hide my face again, harbor in the shadows
Feel this weight of sin hammering away
Die with the guilt of a thousand AWOL soldiers
Die, watch the scythe usher me astray
I can’t go on this way, not as I am today
The ugly side of me is strong
Take aim, a loaded gun, pull back on all who run
A coward’s truth inside the wrong

[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war

[Verse 2]
Lash your tongue of bane, carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust, battle never ends
Lie, mask the pain of a child who’s forsaken
Lie to myself, praise the new regime
I left me long ago, reasons you’ll never know
No one to miss me when I’m gone
With no more words to say, no argument to stay
Another post I don’t belong

[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
No home to call my own
No finding someone new
No one to break the fall
No one to see me through
No name to carry on
No promise for today
No one to hear the call
No tattered flag to raise

[Verse 3]
Walk the razor’s edge cut into the madness
Question all you trust buy into the fear
I see the man ripping at my soul now
I, I know the man, I know him all too well
There’s nothing here for free, lost who I want to be
My serpent blood can strike so cold
On any given day, I’ll take it all away
Another thought I can’t control

[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war"
Everybody Wants To Rule The WorldLorde,"[Verse 1]
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 2]
It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Chorus]
There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world"
Car Radiotwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 2]
Sometimes quiet is violent, I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 3]
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep, we
Need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Bridge]
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit

[Verse 1]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence"
1000hpGodsmack,"[Verse 1]
Time to rewind
Back to 1995 when we were nothing
Walking through the streets of Boston no one listening
No one caring about the empty rooms we played
Until they all showed up one day
Then we took the stage and everything changed

[Chorus]
Turn that shit up louder
Make it all go faster
Play it through the witching hour
Take it to one thousand horsepower

[Verse 2]
Under lights now
Playing to the masses everything feels right
Taking state by state by country over night
Living in a shell entering every fight
Seeing millions of people rage
When we take our stage, everybody scream

[Chorus]
Turn that shit up louder
Make it all go faster
Play it through the witching hour
Take it to one thousand horsepower

[Bridge]
Turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive! Yeah!

[Chorus]
Turn that shit up louder
Make it all go faster
Play it through the witching hour
Take it to one thousand horsepower
Turn that shit up louder
Make it all go faster
Playing through the witching hour
Take it to one thousand horsepower"

Oh, we don't have forever
Baby, daylight's wasting
You better kiss me

Oh, baby, take me, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before time has run out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see

Edge Of A RevolutionNickelback,"[Verse 1]
Head high, protest line
""Freedom"" scribbled on your sign
Headline, New York Times
Standing on the edge of a revolution
Hey, hey, just obey
Your secret's safe with the NSA
In God we trust or the CIA?
Standing on the edge of a revolution
Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution

[Chorus]
No, we won't give up, we won't go away
'Cause we're not about to live in this mass delusion
No, we don't wanna hear another word you say
'Cause we know they're all depending on mass confusion
No, we can't turn back, we can't turn away
'Cause it's time we all relied on the last solution
No, we won't lay down and accept this fate
'Cause we're standing on the edge of a revolution

[Verse 2]
Wall Street, common thief
When they get caught they all go free
A brand new yacht and a finder's fee
Standing on the edge of a revolution
Same shit, different day
Can't keep fed if I can't get paid
We'll all be dead if the shit don't change
Standing on the edge of a revolution
Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution

Back To The ShackWeezer,"[Verse 1]
Sorry guys, I didn't realize that I needed you so much
I thought I'd get a new audience, I forgot that disco sucks
I ended up with nobody and I started feelin' dumb
Maybe I should play the lead guitar and Pat should play the drums

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack

[Verse 2]
I finally settled down with my girl and I made up with my dad
Had to go and make a few mistakes so I could find out who I am
I'm lettin' all of these feelings out even if it means I fail
'Cause this is what I was meant to do and you can't put that on sale

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack

[Bridge]
We belong in the rock world
There is so much left to do
If we die in obscurity, oh well
At least we raised some hell

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack"
GirlsThe 1975,"[Verse 1]
Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where's the fun in doing what you're told?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said ""No!""
""Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night, I'll make you""
""I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior""
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said ""Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with thirty-year-olds and you think you've made it
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?""
Wrestle to the ground

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls

Destined to be hard
I told her from the start

Destined to be hard
Break your heart

I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior

We Are DoneThe Madden Brothers,"I want you to know
It’s time to go
Yeah we are done
I want you to see
That I need (oh) to be free


(Done done done done done done)
We are done
(Done done done done done done)
We are...

Done with being a silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No we won’t just go back
Home without you hearing
The sound when the many say
We are done

You, first brought the sun
For everyone, uh here to see
Why, does it always change
To guns and chains, eventually


(Done done done done done done)
We are done
(Done done done done done done)
We are...

Done with being a silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No we won’t just go back
Home without you hearing

We are done

Done with being a silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No we won’t just go back
Home without you hearing
The sound when the many say

Earthquake DriverCounting Crows,"I was born again a little north of Disneyland
Somewhere under Wonderland
In Hollywood
But then I had to go
Skipping and diving and bouncing
Back to New York City
Straight through the heart of America
Where all the wild things grow

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

I live alone,but I am hungry for affection
I just struggle with connection
Til the water calls me home
Down under the ocean
Among millions of other lonely people
Drowning among the only people
We are ever going to know

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don't wanna go home

I wanna be like the people I see
They want a rover just like me
I wanna stay but what keeps me away is
I’m tied into the lightning line
I wanna see if the sun is shining
Long night’s just a waste of time
I don’t wanna see people like me
Just sleeping and waking and hoping and hating and…

You look at me like I’m a carnival attraction
You say “Love is an abstraction
Just some ghost that you chase”
Well, I am a cypher
I am a blank space
Filled up with words you remember
From whenever you see my face

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I don’t wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

I wanna be like all the people I see
They want a rover just like me
I wanna stay but what keeps me away
Is I’m plugged into the lightning line
I wanna be where the sun is shining all night
Chasing time
I don’t wanna be with people like me
Just creeping and waking and
Hoping and hating and…

What is the price for all this fame and self-absorption?
We turn ourselves into orphans
And then spend our nights alone
Living in fear of some imaginary consequence
Terror incognito
O-bla-di
Libido

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I don’t wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

Truth is, I don't wanna be no earthquake driver
And I do not want to be an aquarium diver
But hey, I just don't wanna go home

Oh man, just don't wanna go home
Oh, I do not wanna go home"
FlawsBastille,"[Verse 1]
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws
Are laid out one by one
A wonderful part of the mess that we made
We pick ourselves undone
All of your flaws and all of my flaws
They lie there hand in hand
Ones we've inherited, ones that we learn
They pass from man to man

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a hole in my soul
I can't fill it, I can't fill it
There's a hole in my soul
Can you fill it? Can you fill it?

[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

[Post-Chorus]
Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

[Verse 2]
All of your flaws and all of my flaws
When they have been exhumed
We'll see that we need them to be who we are
Without them, we'd be doomed

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a hole in my soul
I can't fill it, I can't fill it
There's a hole in my soul
Can you fill it? Can you fill it?

[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted

You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

BallastNothing More,"[Verse 1:]
When did we become these sinking stones?
When did we build this broken home?
Holding each other like ransom notes
Dropping our hearts to grip our brothers' throats

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't see because you don't know
You're caught below, beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside, half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?
Close your mind, identify
Do you feel, do you feel?
Do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score

We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

[Chorus:]
This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes we're walking blind

[Verse 2:]
Anchored in anger, we exile ourselves
Bitter blood builds our prison cell
Darker water now fills our lungs
The depths of our heart have blacked the sun

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Naked we come, naked we leave
Fools we are, to hold tightly
We are free, we are free
(We are the jail, we are the key) x2

[Chorus 2:]
This is the time that we let it go
Yeah, these are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we just open our eyes

[Chorus 3:]
This is the time that we let it go
And this is the pain we are forced to know
Singing the song that's inside, inside us all
Inside us all

Walking blind"
Hunger Of The Pinealt-J,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sleeplessly embracing
Butterflies and needles
Line my seamed-up join
Encased in case I need it
In my stomach, for my heart
Chain mail

[Coda]
Hunger of the pine
Hunger of the pine

[Verse 2]
Sleeplessly embracing
Yawn yearns into me
Plenty more tears in the sea
And so you finally use it
Bedding with me you see at night
Your heart wears knight armour

Hunger of the pine

[Chorus]
(I'm a female rebel)
Sleeplessly
Embracing
You

[Verse 3]
Realisation grew on me
As quickly as it takes your hand
To warm the cool side of the pillow
I’m there for you, be there for me
I’ll hum the song the soldiers sing
As they march outside our window
Hunger of the pine

[Interlude]

Sleeplessly
Embracing
You
Sleeplessly
Embracing
You

Sleeplessly
Embracing
You

Gotta Get AwayThe Black Keys,"[Verse 1]
I got paid, then I was on the road
In a heartbeat, Mama said Mama said
You got a one track mind, but you ain't gonna get it all the time
She wasn't lyin'

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

[Verse 2]
My last dime, got used up
On gasoline, know what I mean, what I mean
Atlanta, GA by the end of the day
No other way, that's what I say

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

[Bridge]
And everything I had to say
Wish we'd gone so far away
Well now I
Can't stay

[Verse 3]
Blacktop, I can't stop
For no one, it's no fun, no fun
With a one track mind if you don't get lucky some time
But still I'm tryin'

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone"

There is a song
You're trembling to its tune
At the request of the moon
Licking her chops
She looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I said
What are you smoking?

Only a crazy little thing I read

What are you smoking?
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read

Are trying to become the stars
And we really came from Mars
The earth is alive
And man is a parasite
And heavenly bodies make us fight

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I said
What are you smoking?

Do YouSpoon,"[Vocalization intro]

[Verse One]
I was on 45th
I was half out of a bag (Oh yeah)
Yeah I knew that you saw me
You laughed when I looked back
I thought of given up
Now I didn't feel so bad
And then a shock went through me
And then I walked right back (Uh)

[Chorus]
Do you want to get understood? (Oh yeah)
Oh, do you want one thing or are you looking for sainthood?
Do you run when it's just getting good?
Oh do you, do you, do you, do you

[Verse Two]
Someone get popsicles
Someone do something bout this heat
Cause it's late in October
And tar's still melting in the streets
You tiptoe for ages and lose yourself
Flipping back pages, unbuckling belts

[Chorus (variation)]
Oh love, that's the way love comes
Do you, don't you know that that's the way love comes?
Do you feel it black and blue?
Oh do you, do you, do you, do you

You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, you won't ever bring me down!

No hate, no shame, no one to blame
You might disguise, your life with lies
I won't chastise even if you think you can...

Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, You won’t ever bring me down!

I can't escape from your disdain
Your hurt, your pain, your drama is lame
Why can't you find some peace inside?
I won't chastise even when you think you can...

Bring me down!
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, You won’t ever bring me down!

The Negative OneSlipknot,"[Intro]
Fuck!

[Verse 1]
Fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I'm going to burn, so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind 'cause you're never going to give in
It's a crisis, just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Svengali, why are we the enemies?
I never follow, and I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna get ya
Because your walls can't support each other
Settle for the cynical, you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?

[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
I hope you live to see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die, you see my face
You're the only one to blame
Yeah
Fuck

[Bridge]
The prescient, the nascent, the quotient
They all will fall
The cystic, symbolic, condition
Systemic
Egregious, replete with these lesions
Contaminate
Succumb to the selfish creation
Your failure

[Verse 3]
No accountability, divisibility
I point a finger, but it's always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away, the killer is disavowed

[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
I hope you live to see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die, you see my face
You're the only one to blame
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one
The negative one
The negative one
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

Last Love SongZZ Ward,"We were never the marrying type, oh no
We won't buy dishes or stained glass lights, oh no
For a table we'll never sit at
In the house that we won't ever get

I won't wake up and pick out your tie, oh no
You won't come home and kiss me at night, oh no
We won't lie in this king bed for two
Say goodbye to us saying ""I do's""

No more white picket fences
No more lace veils or vows
No more, ""You're the only one"" cause that's all done with now
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you

Take these roses and this Jameson, oh no
Find a subway that I can sit in, oh no
Buy a one-way out of the city
Everything that I need, got it with me

No more white picket fences
No more lace veils or vows
No more, ""You're the only one"" cause that's all done with now
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you

All these notes and all these words
Are all that's left in me
Bend these pages, count my woes
One last song to set me free

No more white picket fences
No more lace veils or vows
No more, ""You're the only one"" cause that's all done with now
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you, oh"
Beware The DogThe Griswolds,"[Verse 1]
We used to go
Where no one dared to go
And now you chase the dragon on your own
She used to suck the fun out of me
Beware the dog who's howling songs about defeat
Begging for love but you're old enough to know better than you know
You hate so much that you're better off alone

[Chorus]
She used to suck the life out of me
We used to joke and it felt like home
But now it's all just hazy
We used to walk where the wild things grow
But now you're fucking crazy
We used to go where the cool kids go
But now you're just too lazy
We used to joke and it felt like home
But now you're fucking crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy

Beware the ghost who lives on Salamander Road
Trapped in a cloud of smoke
It's old enough to know better than it knows
Hates so much you'd better leave that prick alone

We used to [joke] and it felt like gold
But now it's all just hazy

My old man, he kicked me out, he kicked me out
When I told him that I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, he doesn't own me
He doesn't own me, he doesn't own me
He doesn't own me (Just escape!)

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 2: Chris Mansfield]
The black rims align your face
Like a deer drinking water in a picture frame
I swear to God I've seen those eyes
The back of my lids when closing mine
With clasped hands we shake it out, we shake it out
Lace our boots and we walk away
I felt slightly connected to him
And said now boy, now you own me

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He doesn't sleep
So in truth he never wakes up
Another day rushing to his death
Out of breath on the treadmill of the famous
He makes mistakes
Tells stories to his paintbrush
And when the world finally sees his art
He wishes that he never would have made it
Just escape, just escape
Ricochets and eclipses faith
Living in a city with a grey umbrella over your shoulders
And you're becoming suffocated by the weight
Can't hit those brakes, this is what you wanted, huh?
But you got it all in vain
'Cause you forgot who you are
Right as the world learned your name
It goes...

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Let me ash my issues
Ashtray as this asphalt
American spirits, black coffee
Conversations and a passport
When God gives you everything
Everything that you ever asked for
And it still looks a bit different
Than when you pictured it on that back porch
And I'm gone
World traveller all I got is my songs
When the nights start blending into one another, and I don't recall
Tom Petty in this motherfucker, all I wanna do is free fall
Yeah, free fall
And I'm so caught up, I'm caught up
I'm caught up and I'm so tired
Swore that I wouldn't stare into the light
And guess who tried it, shit, I'm blinded
By this lime light, this lime light
It's all night, it's all day
These bright lights, these bright lights
Once you turn 'em on you can't walk away
Don't die here, don't die here
I came too far, I'm too great
But I'm too scared, I'm too afraid
To stare this world into its face
I'm almost home, I'm driving lost
My eyelids close, life turns to grey
The cameras off, the show is over
You close the curtains and just escape

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Outro: Chris Mansfield]
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way

World On FireSlash,"[Intro]
Well they say that we are tragic
And they say we're born to lose
You're the misfit
I'm the sinner
You're the heathen
I'm the fool

[Verse 1]
But today you'll be the master
Or the slave it's up to you
Oh my beautiful disaster
Take me anyway you choose

[Chorus]
Don't fight it
Ignite it
This much I’m sure

[Verse 2]
I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
It may never be this good again

It's like a new religion
Speak in tongues come see the light
Do not trip on inhibitions
That will only waste my time

Let me tempt you with the evils
Of the flesh and so much more
Like a Babylon redeemer
Like a pusher like a whore

[Chorus]
Just try it
You'll like it
I’ll give you more

[Verse 3]
I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
It may never be this good again

It’s so dark I can't see
All the truth inside us
All I want is to feel
Something that’s real before the end

[Chorus]
Close the door
Turn the key
Do you like
What you see?

[Verse 4]
Kill the lights
Oh come to me
Set it off tonight
Baby just like fire and gasoline

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
I'm so fucking bored so trip the wire
It may never be this good again

[Chorus]
Just trip the wire
This world’s on fire
Just trip the wire
It may never be this good again"
Trainwreck 1979Death From Above 1979,"[Verse 1]
I was born, on the highway, in a train wreck
With a heart, that was beating, out of my chest
So now I follow it, around the world, I can't keep up
If I don't get it soon, I know I'll bleed, until I drop

[Chorus]
Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

[Verse 2]
There's a darkness, and a hollow, on the highway
Every cross, on the roadside, tells a story
So now I follow it, around the world, I can't keep up
The story never ends, as long as we have blood and guts

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

[Bridge]
It ran off the track
In 11, 79 (eleven seven-nine)
While the immigrants slept
There wasn't much time
The mayor came calling
And got them out of bed
They packed up their families
And headed up wind
A poison cloud
A flaming sky
200,000 people
And no one died
And all before
The pocket dial
Yeah!

[Refrain]
I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

Now I'm stranded
Tied to the tracks
There's no hero
There's no villain
There's nobody I can blame
The story's still the same
I'm never satisfied
It's a problem with my brain

Everywhere I Go (Kings And Queens)New Politics,"Downtown hopping fences
I smashed a window on a Lexus
Now 5-0’s on my tail, but they movin’ like a snail
I got some shit to sell
But everybody’s gotta get by
I got holes in my pockets
Everybody wants to stay high
So you know I got it, if you want it

This one’s for everyone that said I'm nothing
This one’s for my friends that don’t give a fuck
So if you don’t give a fuck sing:

Everywhere I go, I’m higher than United, fly with me
Everybody knows, there’s no sleep ‘till Brooklyn, no sleep
We get high, we get by, yet we roll with it
We’ve been up, we’ve been down, we got over it
Everywhere we go, we’re the kings and queens, and we run this city

I got prior offensives
You know this life it can be hectic
Now it might seem like a death wish
Being so young and fucking reckless

Everybody’s gotta get by
I got holes in my pockets
Everybody wants to stay high
So you know I got it, if you want it

This one’s for everyone that said I’m nothing
This one’s for my friends that don’t give a fuck
So if you don’t give a fuck sing:

Everywhere I go, I’m higher than united fly with me
Everybody knows, there’s no sleep ‘til Brooklyn, no sleep

We’ve been up, we’ve been down, we got over it
Everywhere we go, we’re the kings and queens, and we run this city

This one’s for the accidental lovers
This one’s for the ones who are not in love
To my ex, to my mom, to my dad, and the teachers
My boss, and the cops, oh my God all the preachers
All the give, and the take, and the take, and the give
Now we’ve taken enough, it’s enough so just sing:

Everywhere I go, I'm higher than united fly with me
Everybody knows, there’s no sleep 'til Brooklyn, no sleep
We get high, we get by, yet we roll with it
We’ve been up, we’ve been down, we got over it
Everywhere we go, we’re the kings and queens, and we run this city

We’re the kings and queens and we run this city

Maybe I'm AmazedLuke Wade,"Verse 1:
If you looking for me
I’m where the palm trees breeze
My attention is at ease
I’m at peace
I ain’t fighting with a dark knight
Concentrated like a Sunny Delight
And got my sights set on the stars above me
Love of my life by my side, I’m lucky
To be here, I see clear, my feet near the waves
Current thoughts flooding the page
I’m like amazed in this stage of life
Where I’m living for the moment
I plug ‘em in the picture, HD with the components
Of your mind, flying through the skies like I’m Diddy Kong
Racing against time ‘cause lately we don’t get along
Been losing grip on the hours in the days
Was bitter for a minute but that was only a phase
Like that Call of Duty clan
Live my life in a maze
Chasing the cheese, it almost led me to the grave
For real

Chorus:
And I ain’t got no Mercedes Benz
Just ATs and a couple friends
Through this lens I can see over the water
Soon I’ll be on that Midnight Train to Georgia
Huh, now can you picture that?
Click, click, click
Tell me can you picture that? Now picture that
Tell me can you picture that? Now picture that
Tell me can you picture that? Huh?

Verse 2:
Frame it, claim it, that Kodak, you know that
Memories of that old me, I’ll never go back
I stack blue ink on these pages fat hardly thin
But these clowns red and black, like it’s Harley Quinn
Then I lose ‘em in a translation of the scroll
While I scroll past comments left by the trolls
I control, alt delete task, I’m my own management
Devil in they ear, and fear what abanishment
I’m used to abandonment, from foster home to home
No friends, I was always alone
But I kept the music on, melodies became my bestie
Skin color brown, police wanna arrest me
Know teachers, they test me
They all on my testes
But I’m a different breed, you gotta respect steez
Please, I’m ahead of my time
Skating power lines, I ain’t never scared of the grind
Never, ever

Verse 3 (Mega Ran):
Ever
Picture that with a Nikon
The icon with a mic for a sidearm
Drop a pipe-bomb shaking up the scene
Tryna kick-up get the green then I’m gone ‘fore the lights on
And [?] ain’t signed like Blew is
Maybe ‘cause you ain’t grind like Blew did
Not a bit of traction in your movement
Think you tried everything, well how about improvement?
Now we over nine thousand
Dropping projects like gentrified housing
North Carolina style in it profiling
Picture that with a flash like Barry Allen
Life is like a camera developed from the negative
Capture the good times and involve your relatives
Smile really wide with everything that you got
And if it turns out wack, just take another shot
Picture that

Chorus:
And I ain’t got no Mercedes Benz
Just ATs and a couple friends
Through this lens I can see over the water
Soon I’ll be on that Midnight Train to Georgia
Huh, now can you picture that?

Tell me can you picture that? Now picture that
Tell me can you picture that? Now picture that
Tell me can you picture that? Huh?

Picture that, picture that, picture that that that

Verse 4:
You don’t know about the struggle
What you know about
Going days without food, steady having doubts?
Nobody give you handouts
Fam leave you hanging
And the wrong words get you shot thanks to gangbanging
Man, but let me hold my tongue
Was getting high just to balance all the lows I done
You gotta go my son
Granny told me from the clouds
You learn from the journey
Just know that I’m proud of the man you became
I hold your picture close to my heart
The frames in my mind gives me hope when I start
To lose sight on the bigger picture
It’s for the people
Just know that I’m here wit’cha
Ya know?

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna leave this town

Some Nightsfun.,"[Chorus 1]
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

She stops my bones from wondering

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again

What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?

[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

[Bridge 2]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

[Outro]
The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh"
The A TeamEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Alternate Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die"
Little TalksOf Monsters And Men,"[Refrain: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Verse 1: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Bridge: Nanna, Ragnar]
You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Outro: Nanna, Ragnar]
Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore"
I Will WaitMumford,"[Verse 1]
Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

[Bridge]
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Hook]
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess

[Hook]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 3]
So I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

[Bridge]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

[Hook]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you"
Too CloseAlex Clare,"[Verse 1]
You know I'm not one to break promises
I don't want to hurt you, but I need to breathe
At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

[Pre-Chorus]
Which way is right?
Which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're heading separate ways

[Chorus]
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

[Verse 2]
You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's oh so much that you deserve
Nothing to say
Nothing to do
I've nothing to give
I must live without you
You know we're heading separate ways

[Chorus]
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way

[Chorus]
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way"

[Verse 1]
I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve, mmm
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

[Bridge 1]
I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you mean

[Verse 2]
And now I need to know - is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? mmm
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

[Bridge 2]
And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you need

[Verse 3]
But now I have finally seen the end

Stubborn LoveThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
She'll lie and steal and cheat
And beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you the one you can't repair
But I still love her
I don't really care

[Bridge]
When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

[Verse 2]
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love is indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

[Chorus]
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

[Verse 3]
And I don't blame you, dear
For running like you did all these years
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

[Bridge]
When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

[Chorus]
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love"
Carry Onfun.,"[Verse 1]
Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

[Verse 2]
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

[Bridge]
Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge 2]
Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

No one's ever gonna stop us now"
Take A WalkPassion Pit,"[Verse 1]
All these kind of places
Make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone
My wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed a while
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so
At most I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
And there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came
Just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children
Play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Honey it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills
We had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward
To admit when I'm in need
I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh"
Mountain SoundOf Monsters And Men,"[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I have caused with my two hands

[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar]
Along we travelled on, with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away...

[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, Ragnar]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran...

[Verse 2: Ragnar]
Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran...

[Post-Chorus 1: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa oh, oh, oh-oh
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Whoa oh, whoa oh
(We sleep until the sun goes down)

Whoa oh, whoa oh

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran...

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran...

Take it off, take it in
Take off all the thoughts of what we've been
Take a look, hesitate
Take a picture you could never recreate
Write a song, make a note
For the lump that sits inside your throat
Change the locks, change the scene
Change it all, but can't change what we've been

Oh, oh

It's okay if it's gone
The thoughts that you had that it was the one
And, oh, what is left?
For all those times, is that what you get?
Oh, regardless, the walls get painted anyway
Oh, you're guarding the gates, but it all got away

They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go to a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared to the back of my mind

Flowers In Your HairThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair
See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

[Verse 2]
So then we grew a little and knew a lot
And how we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured
Cause it’s a long road to wisdom
But it’s a short one
To being ignored

[Chorus]
Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes
Aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart

[Verse 3]
So now i think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it’s not too late cause you’re so attractive
And the way you move
I won’t close my eyes
It takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

[Chorus]
Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes
Aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart"
Chalk OutlineThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
I've been cursed, I've been crossed
I've been beaten by the ones that get me off
I've been cut, I've been opened up
I've been shattered by the ones I thought I loved

[Chorus]
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind is a chalk outline

[Verse 2]
I've been cold in the crypt
But not as cold as the words across your lips
You'll be sorry baby someday
When you reach across the bed where my body used to lay

You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind is a chalk outline

All you left behind is a chalk outline
All you left behind

You left me here like a chalk outline

BabelMumford,"[Verse 1]
‘Cause I know that time has numbered my days
And I’ll go along with everything you say
But I’ll ride home laughing, look at me now
The walls of my town, they come crumbling down
And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons
And I know their choices color all I’ve done
But I’ll explain it all to the watchman’s son
I never lived a year better spent in love

[Hook]
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask

(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride
I stretch my arms into the sky
I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now
Then the walls of my town, they come crumbling down
You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we’ve been
You know our breath is weak and our body thin

[Bridge]
Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should’ve known I was weaker from the start
You’ll build your walls and I will play my bloody part
To tear, tear them down
Well, I’m gonna tear, tear them down

[Hook]
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask"
Slow It DownThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
I feel her filth in my bones
Wash off my hands til it's gone
The walls they're closing in
With velvet curtains

[Verse 2]
Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

[Verse 3]
They're makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo

[Chorus]
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

[Verse 4]
Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight

[Chorus]
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

[Verse 5]
And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you

[Verse 6]
I never, she never, we never looked back
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough on

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
Don't you frown when you're feelin like that
Only love can dig you out of this"
Classy GirlsThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
Well she was standing in a bar
I said, ""hello
How do you do?""
She handed me a beer with a kangaroo
She spoke of places I had never been
That she had traveled to
And we slow danced alone to faster tunes
I made her laugh, I made a pass
I showed her my half-dollar ring
She said, ""that’s pretty cool,""
But classy girls don’t kiss in bars you fool
No they don't

[Verse 2]
So later on the crowd calmed down
And I believe it was as if
Something drew me closer to her
So picture my surprise when I had
Tried to lean in for a kiss
And she just smiled and turned her head down quick
I asked her why, and she replied
It was nothing I was doing wrong
It’s just what it is
But classy girls, don’t kiss in bars like this

[Chorus]
No classy girls don’t kiss in bars
Boys will break their backs and hearts
But it’s all right
The hardest part is through

Oh through
Oh through
Oh through
The hardest part is through"

When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

[Bridge]
Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me

[Chorus]
And I will do it for you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3]
When you fall like a statue
I'm gon' be there to catch you
Put you on your feet, you on your feet
And if your well is empty
Not a thing will prevent me
Tell me what you need, what do you need

[Pre Chorus]
I surrender honestly
You've always done the same for me

[Chorus]
So I will do it for you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone

[Bridge]
You're my backbone
You're my cornerstone
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving
You're my head start
You're my rugged heart
You're the pulse that I've always needed
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum my heart never stops beating

[Chorus]
For you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long
Long after you're gone

[Outro]
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum my heart never stops beating for you
And long after you're gone, gone, gone
I'll love you long after you're gone gone, gone"
Give Me LoveEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

[Refrain 1]
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Lover Of The LightMumford,"And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine

Stretch out my life
And pick the seams out
Take what you like
But close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over

I had done wrong
You built your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again

[Hook]
But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

Skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward

I know I've tried
I was not stable
Flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up -- breathe in, breathe out

[Hook]

And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
You may not trust the promises
Of the change I'll show
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine

"Lessons In Love (All Day, All Night)Neon Trees","[Verse 1]
When you walk my way
I feel a rush come over me
A sharp panic panic
It's the things you say
That makes a rush come over me
It happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules (na na)
I'm better just pretending I was the fool

[Chorus]
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love

[Verse 2]
If I walk away
I feel a push inside of me
That won't let me leave
But what could I say
For you to feel what's inside of me
This happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules (na na)
I'm better just pretending I was the fool (hear me out)

[Chorus]
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love

I'm only lonely when the lights are on
I want the same rush over and over and over and over and over
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
Come on!
Whoa!

[Chorus]
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun

Dead SeaThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
I stood alone upon the platform in vain
The Puerto Ricans
They were playing their salsa in the rain
With open doors and manual locks
In fast food parking lots
I headed west I was a man on the move
New York it lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh I need somebody, I needed someone I could trust
And I don’t gamble, but if I did
I would bet on us

[Chorus]
Like the Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

[Verse 2]
You told me you were good at runnin' away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
They took the rest when you took a nap
Yes there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live it for yourself, you felt
You just felt it was time
And I’m glad, cause you with cats
That’s just not right

[Chorus]
Like the Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

[Bridge]
I've been down, I been defeated
You’re the message, I will heed it
Would you stay with me
Would you stay the night, oh

[Chorus]
Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, I'm so Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea"
SubmarinesThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
I believe submarines
Underneath deep blue sea
Saw the flags, Japanese
No one will believe me
Ran back to the town bar
And I told the people how
I had seen a submarine
And everyone laughed aloud

[Verse 2]
I did spy a periscope
Dead of night on the eastern coast
The police made them jokes
Told me I’d seen a ghost
Everyone thinks I’m a liar
No one knows the truth
If it was a bigger fire
I would be on the roof

[Interlude]
Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay
(Let me go)
No one trusts what I say
(I don’t know)
Oh my god, no one paid (attention)
Overnight my hair turned gray
(Oh oh oh)
In the end it boils down to credibility
I had none, so I will die with the secrets of the sea

Carry OnAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
Some people live out selfish desires
Some choose to shout when they speak and they'll be the star
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice, one for tomorrow

[Bridge]
(They say we've lost our minds
We've just gained control)

[Chorus]
Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on

[Bridge]
(Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear)

[Verse 2]
Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky, guiding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow

[Bridge]
(Destroy their perfect crime
Watch the power fold)

[Chorus]
Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on"
Lego HouseEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

[Interlude]
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking and it's more than I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done

I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I will love you better now"
StarsGrace Potter,"[Verse 1]
I lit a fire with the love you left behind
And it burned wild and crept up the mountain side
I followed your ashes into outer space
I can't look out the window, I can't look at this place

[Chorus]
I can't look at the stars
They make me wonder where you are
Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard
And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far
So I, I can't look at the stars

[Verse 2]
All those times we looked up at the sky
Looking out so far, it felt like we could fly
And now I'm all alone in the dark of night
And the moon is shining, but I can't see the light

[Chorus]
And I can't look at the stars
They make me wonder where you are
Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard
And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far
So I, I can't look at the stars
Stars
Stars, they make me wonder where you are
Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard
And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far
So I can't look at the stars"
DrunkEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

[Verse 2]
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

[Pre-Chorus 2]
On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

[Bridge]
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

[Chorus]
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"
CloserTegan And Sara,"[Verse 1]
All I want to get is a little bit closer
All I want to know is
Can you come a little closer?
Here comes the breath before we get
A little bit closer
Here comes the rush before we touch
Come a little closer

The doors are open, the wind is really blowing
The night sky is changing overhead

I’m the type who won't get oh so critical
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical

All you think of lately is getting underneath me
All I dream of lately is how to get you underneath me
Here comes the heat before we meet
A little bit closer
Here comes the spark before the dark
Come a little closer

The lights are off and the sun is finally setting
The night sky is changing overhead

Lovely girl, won’t you stay
Won’t you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see

Fleet of black, fleet of black limousines
These tinted machines, here comes the cavalcade
With the armored cars, armored cars like Berettas
Flags on antennaes designed to keep me safe, keep me safe

[Chorus]
And oh my my, oh hey hey
Here he comes, the candidate
Blue eyed boy, United States
Vote for him, the candidate

Diamonds cut, diamonds cut for the carrots
Plaster of Paris, the floats fill up the street
And the beauty queens, beauty queens with the white gloves
All sick from the night clubs, they wave with pageantry, pageantry

Oh my my, oh hey hey
Here it comes, the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way, for the big parade

Oh

Canvas covered, canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say, bookies say it’s the 3rd round
Oh, when Louie will go down
If he don’t, there’s hell to pay and hell to raise

And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the welterweight
Take a dive, for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight

Catholic priest, Catholic priest in a crisis
He’s torn between romance and Jesus
Who will win the civil war
And he says I’m in love, I’m in love with a woman
Yeah, this is my confession
I’m leaving, I can’t be a priest anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
And oh my, oh hey hey
There he goes, the man of faith
Left the church for a fiance
Let him love, the man of faith

[Verse 5]
TV cameras, TV cameras and stage hands
American Bandstand, electric guitars
And he’s singin' songs, singin' songs for the lonely
All the girls with the room keys
They know all his words by heart, by heart and they all sing

All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl, won’t you stay

Oh my my, oh hey hey
Here she comes by saving grace
Burn the car and save the plates
She’s arrived, my saving grace"

In The EndBlack Veil Brides,"[Intro]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life?

[Verse 1]
In the end
As my soul's laid to rest
What is left of my body
Or am I just a shell?
And I have fought
And with flesh and blood I commanded an army
Through it all
I have given my heart for a moment of glory
(I gave it all)

[Chorus]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to die

[Verse 2]
Born a saint
Though with every sin I still wanna be holy
I will live again
Who we are
Isn't how we live we are more than our bodies
If I fall I will rise back up and relive my glory

In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)

I'm not afraid to die

Who will remember this last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid

Not afraid

Not not afraid

Absolute ZeroStone Sour,"[Verse 1]
The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot, I can show you the truth
And I don’t need a reason to lie to you
No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don’t have a weapon, you can’t have mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the devil, but I won’t be your hero

[Verse 2]
The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your primadonnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react, it’s as simple as that
It’s better just to settle than face the facts

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the devil, but I won’t be your hero

[Bridge]
One thing that I can’t stand
Is when the minutes fight the second hand
I’ll waste a lifetime's worth just to cling to one more day

[Verse 3]
No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
Man is a four-letter word, it’s really absurd
The hate isn't fake it’s just inferred

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
I’m down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I’m not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the devil, but I won’t be your hero"

Listen up, there's not a moment to spare
It's quite a drop from the top, so how you feeling down there?
It’s a cold, cruel, harsh reality
Caught stuck here with your enemies

[Pre-Chorus]
Who do you think you are
Tearing us all apart?
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It’s twenty to one
Yeah, so you better run

[Chorus]
You got the world on its knees
You’re taking all that you please
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
You’re like the burden we bear
You’re all the hate that we share
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
But enemies
Enemies

[Verse 2]
You started something that you just couldn't stop
You turned the ones that you love into the angriest mob
And their one last wish is that you pay for it
And there's no way you're getting out of this

Who do you think you are
Tearing us all apart?
Where did you think you could go?

Heaven Nor HellVolbeat,"[Verse 1]
Well, I've heard that the Devil's walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
But stole it back and forever in debt

[Pre-Chorus]
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I feel his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you

[Chorus]
Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the Devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
Well, baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell

[Verse 2]
Well, I've heard that the morning star of a prince
Was invoked on a Monday on Earth
I found his business card in the mud

[Pre-Chorus]
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I feel his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you

[Chorus]
Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the Devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
Well, baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell

[Bridge]
Evil came down on Earth
And it beholds more than you love
More than you love
Heaven, don't fall on Earth
What you behold is no longer word
No longer words

Well, I've heard that the Devil's walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt

And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you

Been Away Too LongSoundgarden,"[Verse 1]
You can't go home, no I swear you never can
You can walk a million miles and get nowhere
I got nowhere to go ever since I came back
Just filling in the lines from the holes to the cracks

[Chorus 1]
And no one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me

I've been away for too long

[Verse 2]
This place has a special kind of falling apart
Like they put the whole thing together in the dark
No one knows where the edge of the knife is
And no one knows where intelligent life is

[Chorus 1]
And no one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me

[Chorus 2]
But it's fate
I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
Though I never really wanted to stay
I’ve been away for too long
I've been away for too long
I've been away for too long

[Verse 3]
Kilos through key holes
Widows through windows
Pilots through eyelets
Everyone is silent
Tankards and flagons and snifters and flutes on my way home

[Chorus 2]
But it's fate
I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
Though I never really wanted to stay
I’ve been away but it's fake

I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
Though I never really wanted to stay
I’ve been away for too long

Because We CanBon Jovi,"[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

[Verse 1]
She's in the kitchen staring out the window
So tired of living life in black and white
Right now she's missing those technicolor kisses
When he turns down the lights

Lately, he's feeling like a broken promise
In the mirror staring down his doubt
There's only one thing in this world that he knows
He said forever and he'll never let her down

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

TV and takeout on the coffee table
Paper dishes, pour a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
And for the moment everything is alright

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

Because we can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we
We can, just wrap your arms around me

Because we can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we

Whispers In The DarkMumford,"[Verse 1]
You hold your truth so purely
And swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine

[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break a heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I loved
Under this sun!
Under this sun!

And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
And fingers tap into what you were once

Bleeding OutImagine Dragons,"[Chorus]
I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do

I'll bleed out for you

So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

[Verse 1]
When the day has come
That I’ve lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground

When the sky turns grey
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

I'll bleed out for you

So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

[Verse 2]
When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering

When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

Disparate YouthSantigold,"Don’t look ahead there’s stormy weather
Another road block in our way
But if we go, we go together
Our hands are tied here if we stay

Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost

Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah

So let them say we can’t do better
Lay out the rules that we can’t break
They want to sit and watch it wither
Their legacy’s too hard to take

Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost

Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah

Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for

In their heads, hedging their bets, in their
Eyes it shows
When the beacon breaks, what then
You ask they don’t know
Oh tell me that I turn my back, well the
Odds all stand beneath me
And they all said I was misled, but now
The odds all stand beneath me
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
They’re frozen to the core
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost

Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah

Don’t hear what you say

And brace for the glory
As you stare into the sky

Stare at the ceiling
And switch back to your time
Just go ahead
And try and taste it
I know it should be ripe

To get back to your prize

In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye
But I've never wondered why

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly
So I've never had to lie

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

The writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

I've been up in the air
Out of my head
Stuck in a moment of emotion I destroyed
Is this the end I feel?
Up in the air
Fucked up on life
All of the laws I've broken loves that I've sacrificed
Is this the end?

A thousand times I played this game

Lost in the night
I wouldn't trade an eye for your lies
Your lust for my life
Is this the end? (Hey)
You were the love of my life

This is a portrait of a tortured you and I
Is this the, is this the, is this the end?

Carried AwayPassion Pit,"[Verse 1]
Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favourite little scene oh,oh

[Hook]
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

[Verse 2]
All your appeal, once again we'll feel it
Higher education making sense
Justify your thesis, certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense
Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want you
But I think I can fake it if you can
Let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oho

[Hook]
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

Wake up in the morning, wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to
Cause no one's really watching
Won't you have something to say about it
But we all have problems
We're all having problems
And we all got something to say

[Hook]
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head"

The High RoadThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
I told you I was hurt
Bleeding on the inside
I told you I was lost
In the middle of my life
There’s times I stayed alive for you
There’s times I would’ve died for you
There’s times it didn’t matter at all

[Chorus]
Will you help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I’ll take the high road out
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without

Standing in the dark
I can see your shadow
You’re the only light
That’s breaking through the window
There’s times I stayed alive for you
There’s times I would’ve died for you
There’s times it didn’t matter at all

Will you help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around

To be the mistake you can’t live without

Well I’m not going to give it away
Not going to let it go, just to wake up someday gone
Gone

And knowing that I was wrong

Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I’ll take the high road out
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without

The PitSilversun Pickups,"[Verse 1]
I am marching through the branches in a fit of wanderlust
To see you in a black hole reaching out for something just
Silhouettes of neighbors dancing in disgust

I’m sure you recognize my noise and you heard about the pit
Been told to be afraid of everything that lives within
But it’s much worse where you are
So will you go for it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I have a feeling you might
A feeling you might

[Chorus]
If somebody somewhere
Will clean out your wounds
Our dirty fingers
Will bury the lie

If somebody somewhere
Would clean out your wounds
And bury the lie
Bury the lie

[Verse 2]
Now we tumble down a hill to a fire with a crowd
The flicker becomes thicker as we bottom out
The residents don’t even notice the sudden shouts

When your eyes adjust and you see what’s in view
Discolored and distempered smiles that seem new
Do you realize they were all once like you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I have a feeling you might
A feeling you might

[Chorus]
If somebody somewhere
Will clean out your wounds
Our dirty fingers
Will bury the lie

[Bridge]
No, no
No one cares
Where no one goes

No, no
No one care
Where no one goes

[Verse 3]
You recognize my noise and you heard about the pit
Been told to be afraid of everything that comes within
We can talk about it later but I think you’ve given in
We can talk about it later but I think you’ve given in

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a feeling you might
Bury the lie

Oh, oh"
HeroFamily Of The Year,"[Chorus]
Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else

[Verse]
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend

[Verse 2]
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else

[Chorus]
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else"

I know that I messed up a few times or watcha wanna call it
I know if I fell down, you'd change the way that I saw it
I put it on the line for this time only
(Is that what you really want?)

I can't see that I got red hands, I'm colorblind singing (day-oh)

I've seen it all before, you back out, and everything's changing

Holding On To Youtwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]
I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more ""shotty""
I bet a lot of me was lost,
""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you

[Verse 2]
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it, tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it to a tree tell it,
""You belong to me, this ain't a noose
This is a leash and I have news for you
You must obey me!""

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?

Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts

Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?

Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts

Praying to whoever will listen to me

Been crushed by its weight
There's no stronger message
Than dirt in your face

I deal in a different story

They say the spirit's willing
But the flesh is always weak

Nobody knows when it's gonna stop, yeah

Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow

Still Into YouParamore,"[Verse 1]
Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better

It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

God Is Dead?Black Sabbath,"[Verse 1]
Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

[Chorus 1]
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

[Verse 2]
Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

[Chorus 2]
When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

[Verse 3]
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing’s right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

[Chorus 3]
I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead

[Bridge]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 4]
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead"

You are a brick tied to me that’s dragging me down
Strike a match and I’ll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
Silver clouds with grey linings

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you’re waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
Like our time is running out?
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix

Bring home the boys in scraps, scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
""You broke our spirit,"" says the note we pass

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you’re waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

[Chorus]
Hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
Like our time is running out?
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix

[Break]
Put on your war paint

[Bridge]
The war is won before it’s begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it’s begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it’s begun
Release the doves, surrender love
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
The war is won before it’s begun
(wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
Release the doves, surrender love
(wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)

[Chorus]
Hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
Like our time is running out?
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No I think it looked a little better on me
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
Like our time is running out?
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix

I'll Follow YouShinedown,"[Verse 1]
If I could find assurance to leave you behind
I know my better half would fade
And all my doubt is a staircase for you
Up and out of this maze

[Pre-Chorus]
The first step is the one you believe in
The second one might be profound

[Chorus]
I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you down

[Verse 2]
You can have the money and the world, the angels and the pearls
Even trademark the color blue
Just like the tower we never built, in the shadow of all the guilt
When the other hand was pointed at you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah the first step is the one you believe in
And the second one might be profound

[Chorus]
I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you

[Bridge]
Down to where forever lies, without a doubt I'm on your side
There's nowhere else that I would rather be
I'm not about to compromise, give you up to say goodbye
I'll guide you through the deep
I'll keep you close to me

[Chorus]
I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you

[Outro]
If I could find assurance to leave you behind
I know my better half would fade
I'll follow you down"
Young VolcanoesFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
When Rome's in ruins
We are the lions, free of the Colosseums
In poison places, we are anti venom
We're the beginning of the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds
It's all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won

[Chorus]
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica, do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?

[Verse 2]
C'mon, make it easy, say I never mattered
Run it up the flag pole
We will teach you how to make boys next door
Out of assholes (hahaha!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds
It's all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won

[Chorus]
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica, do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?

The Hangman's Body CountVolbeat,"[Verse 1]
Hear the boots and see the figure dressed in black
Echoes of him have been heard
Spiritually he’s all intact
Guided by the raven since his eyes don’t see
Hear him drag the rope that goes up to the hangman’s tree

[Pre-Chorus]
The wind calls your name
Get out of your bed
Go up to the hills the raven will lead

[Chorus]
Judgment will prevail the hangman is here

[Verse 2]
You smell the rain and as you walk the final dirt
Pictures of the crime are past but not forgotten in this world
See the valley turn to darkness on your way
The only friend you have is standing at the gallows end

[Pre-Chorus]
The wind calls your name
Get out of your bed
Go up to the hills the raven will lead

[Chorus]
Judgment will prevail the hangman is here

[Bridge]
Put on the rope
You knew the day was coming
Say your prayers once more
You’re part of the hangman’s body count

[Verse 3]
Hear the boots and see the figure dressed in black
Echoes of him have been heard
Spiritually he’s all intact

Get out of your bed
Go up to the hills the raven will lead

Judgment will prevail the hangman is here

Where Did The Party GoFall Out Boy,"[Intro]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 1]
I'm here to collect your hearts
It's the only reason that I sing
I don't believe a word you say
But I can't stop listening
This is the story of how they met
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes
And when she touched him he turned ruby red
A story that they'll never forget, never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the boys are smoking Menthols, girls are getting back rubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become exes again

[Chorus]
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know I expect too much
And not enough all at once
You know I only wanted fun
And you got me all fucked up on love
I looked for your name on the ouija board
And your naked magic, oh dear lord
You and me are the difference between real love
And the love on TV, love on TV

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the boys are smoking Menthols, girls are getting back rubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become exes again, yeah

Woah, where did the party go?

Woah, where did the party go?

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Bridge]
We were the kids who screamed, ""we weren't the same,"" in sweaty rooms
Now we're doomed to organizing walk-in closets like tombs
Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema life
So let's fade away together one dream at a time
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

San FranciscoThe Mowgli's,"[Chorus]
Well, I’ve been in love with love, and the
Idea of something binding us together
You know that love is strong enough
And I’ve seen time tell tales about that
Systematic drug, yeah, that heart that beats as one
It’s collectively, unconsciously composed

[Interlude]
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do

Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do

[Verse 1]
Well, I lost my head in San Francisco
Waiting for the fog to roll out
But I found it in a rain cloud
It was smiling down

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C’mon, c’mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Well, I’ve been in love with love, and the

The Death Of MeAsking Alexandria,"[Verse 1]
Am I insane?
I ask myself over and over and over again
Trapped in my brain
Pull it out from the cracks in my skull
Am I alone?
Surrounded by shadows and I think I might just be suffocating

[Pre-Chorus]
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

[Chorus]
I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong and I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back and I'm better than ever

[Verse 2]
Am I insane?
I've rolled myself over and screamed till I spit up blood
Trapped in my brain
The itching is incomprehensible, and it won't stop
Am I alone?
The voices who lie, but they just won't fucking go away

[Bridge]
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
Am I alone surrounded by death? I think this might just be the end
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

[Breakdown]
You can't take this away from me
You can't relieve these demons
You can't make this okay for me
You're the one who caused these feelings
I apologise for what I'm about to do
I try to sympathise
But at the end of the day
You brought this on yourself

[Chorus]
I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong and I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back and I'm better than ever
Now I'm back and I'm better than ever

[Bridge]
The tears have left a blur that I can't explain
The pain has left a hole in which my heart should've been
I'm blind with rage and I can't shake this feeling
Irrational, impetuous, intemperate
I'm blind with rage and I can't shake this feeling
Irrational, impetuous, intemperate

[Chorus]
I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong and I lost my mind before
But I'm back and I'm better than ever"
The Mighty FallFall Out Boy,"[Intro: Big Sean]
Oh god!
Sean Don
Fall Out... Boi

[Verse 1]
Di-di-did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Malibu, ooh, ooh, ooh,)
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever
Bel Air baby, did you get dressed up, pretty pout, pout
(While you bottomed out, out, out, out, oh)
I can't stop it when there's chemicals keeping us together
Uh, uh, uh, I'm singing

[Chorus]
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love

[Verse 2]
Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme and I'm dizzy on dreams
(And I'm dizzy on dreams)
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one
Baby, we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it
(Gutter where we found it)
Cause you think, you think your only crime is that you got caught
I'm singing

[Chorus]
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love

[Bridge]
It's getting clear, you're never coming clean
So lock you up inside and swallow, swallow the key

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Hello? Yeah, I know you said not to call unless I'm dying
Well, I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But, even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope that when you see me, I'm not see-through, you know how we do
Sometimes I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A, but the way we, the way we do is
Deeper, baby, straight-up chemistry, DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin' or workin', so the grind don't stop
They say I got screws missing, well hell, only when I'm missing you
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you

[Chorus]
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love"
Young And BeautifulLana Del Rey,"[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Bridge]
Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?"

Lift Me UpFive Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1: Ivan Moody]
It ain't no mystery
I'm all I have left
I'm pushing back and running you over

I've been thrown down run around
Beaten 'til I hit the ground
Telling you right now that it's over

There's no room for mistakes
All the parts are in place
Say what you will but say it to my face

Better back the fuck up
Better shut the fuck up
I'll do what I want and I'll never give up

[Chorus]
I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answer
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up

[Verse 2: Rob Halford]
I'm gonna change history
Enlighten the world
Teach them how to see through my eyes

I'm gonna lash back check that
Fatal as a heart attack
Stomp out all the ugliest lies

You can't convince me to change
We ain't on the same page
I've had my fill now there's nothing but rage

Best get out of my way
Cause there's nothing to say
Is that all that you got?
Because I ain't got all day

[Chorus]
I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answer
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up

I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answer
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away

Lift me up to fly away
Lift me up to fly away
Lift me up"
Love Is BlindnessJack White,"[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my heart, love is blindness

[Verse 1]
I'm in a parked car, on a crowded street
You see your love made complete
Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness

[Verse 2]
Love is clockworks and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Love is blindness

[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness

[Verse 3]
A little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense

[Verse 4]
Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets, and nobody else to tell
Take the money
Why don't you honey?
Blindness

[Chorus/Outro]
Love is blindness
I'm so sick of it, I don't want to see
Why don't you just take the night
Wrap it all around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness
Love is blindness
Oh, I'm too numb to feel
Blow out the candles
Blindness"
Rose TattooDropkick Murphys,"[Verse 1]
The pictures tell the story
This life has many shades
I’d wake up every morning and before I’d start each day
I’d take a drag from last nights cigarette
That smoldered in its tray
Down a little something and then be on my way
I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn’t be alone

[Chorus 1]
Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo

[Verse 2]
This ones for the mighty sea
Mischief, gold and piracy
This ones for the man that raised me
Taught me sacrifice and bravery
This ones for our favorite game
Black and gold, we wave the flag
This ones for my family name
With pride I wear it to the grave

[Chorus 2]
Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue
I ain't winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo

[Verse 3]
This one means the most to me
Stays here for eternity
A ship that always stays the course
An anchor for my every choice
A rose that shines down from above
I signed and sealed these words in blood
I heard them once, sung in a song
It played again and we sang along

[Bridge]
You’ll always be there with me
Even if you’re gone
You’ll always have my love
Our memory will live on

[Chorus 1]
Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo

[Outro]
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
With pride I’ll wear it to the grave for you
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
Signed and sealed in blood I would die for you"
RiseSkillet,"[Verse 1: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
All I see is shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain in a world we made
Everyday you need
A bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

[Chorus: John Cooper]
Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise and revolution
Unite and fight to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, we rise

[Post-Chorus: John Cooper]
Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise!
Rise, rise

[Verse 2: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
Like a hand grenade
Thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos
Trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb
And when the scars heal
The pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes
Darkness fades away
And the light shines on a brave new day

[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

[Chorus: John Cooper]
Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution
Unite and fight to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, we rise

[Post-Chorus: John Cooper]
Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise!
Rise, rise

[Bridge: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
In a world gone mad
In a place so sad
Sometimes it's crazy, crazy
To fight for what you believe
But you can't give up, no
If you wanna keep what you love!
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Never give up, no

[Interlude 1]
Rise
Rise in revolution
Rise
Rise in revolution
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call

Rise
Like we're alive
Tonight, we rise
Make a better life
Tonight, we rise!

[Chorus: Opera]
Rise, rise, rise and revolution
Rise, rise, rise and revolution
Rise

Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare

Heart's A MessGotye,"[Verse 1]
Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

[Hook]
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

[Verse 2]
You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
(It's not enough)
You just threw away the key
To your heart
You don't get burned
('Cause nothing gets through)
It makes it easier
(Easier on you)
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see
Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect

But I don't wanna waste my love"

StompaSerena Ryder,"[Intro]
There's a light, and I can see it in your eyes
There's a memory of the way you used to be
Nothing's gone, it still shines, every time you turn it on
And when you slow it down...

[Verse 1]
People working every night and day
Never give yourself no time
Got too many bills to pay
Slow down, nothing's gonna disappear
If you give yourself some room
To move to the music you hear

[Chorus]
Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet

[Verse 2]
People looking for the great escape
Looking to the greener side
Trying to find a better way
Slow down, open up your big brown eyes
Feel the rhythm in your heart
You don't even need to try

[Chorus 2]
Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Nothing is wrong, if you move to the beat
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Stompa your feet

[Bridge]
When you can't seem to shake off all the feelings that are breaking
Little pieces of the music that's in you
All the pain that you feel
I can prove it's not real
There's just one thing you gotta do

Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Nothing is wrong, if you move to the beat
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet

AloneFalling In Reverse,"[Intro]
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
So come on

[Verse 1]
White boy on the beat rocking Gucci sneaks
All I do is win, Charlie Sheen
Started out in '06 and revived the scene
So many motherfuckers wanna be like me
Came from the lowest of lows, rose to the top with a vision
My haters talking shit while washing dishes for a living
Fuck you, bitches, I'm a business, I'll be kissing on your missus
What you spend in 15 months is what I spend in 15 minutes

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, don't give a fuck about you
You're feeling froggy, motherfucker? Ain't a damn thing you can do
You're a bitch, you're a punk, don't make me pull the pump
Cock it back and leave you slumped, now that's what I call bad luck

[Chorus]
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of people talking nothing but chatter
""Why'd you switch your style up?"" and that I don't matter
Man, I've been in rap since I was shitting in pampers
Climbed the ladder to the top, and now I'm shitting on rappers
All I do is work, straight up hustle and grind
So many people mad at me for crossing the line
I find it kinda funny, the shit you say in your tweets
But when we're face-to-face, you ain't got nothing to say to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, so fuck you too
You better take a step back before I call up the crew
You talk a lot of shit, but you spread nothing but lies
You keep on running your mouth, you better open your eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

[Bridge]
I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, break your neck
So break your motherfucking neck
I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, break your neck
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, so break your motherfucking neck

[Chorus]
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town

Paper DollJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

[Verse 2]
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

[Chorus]
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

[Verse 3]
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

[Chorus]
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

[Verse 4]
Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky

[Chorus/Outro]
'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall?"
I Got YouJack Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon

[Chorus]
I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

[Verse 2]
We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save them we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
“You need to let go, you got no control""
No

[Chorus]
I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

[Verse 3]
This weight’s too much alone
Some days I can’t hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you
Yea when tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you

[Chorus]
I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you"
Came Back HauntedNine Inch Nails,"[Verse 1]
Ha-ha-haunted
The throat is deep and the mouth is wide
Saw some things on the other side
Made me promise to never tell
But you know me I can't help myself, no

Now I got something you have to see
They put something inside of me
Its smile is red and its eyes are black (black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
I don't think I'll be coming back

[Chorus 1]
I don't believe it I-
I had to see
I came back haunted
I came back haunted
I said goodbye but I
I had to try
I came back haunted
C-c-came back haunted

Everywhere now reminding me
I am not who I used to be
I'm afraid this has just begun
Consequences for what I've done

I don't believe it I-
I had to see
I came back haunted
C-c-came back haunted
I said goodbye but I
I had to try

The One That Got AwayThe Civil Wars,"[Verse 1: Joy Williams with John Paul White]
I never meant to get us in this deep
I never meant for this to mean a thing

Wish you were the one that got away
I got caught up by the chase
And you got high on every little game
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I'd never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

When I was staying just out of your reach
Begging for the slightest touch
Ooh, you couldn't get enough, mmm

Got away from me
Got away from me
Before anybody has to bleed

TrenchesPop Evil,"No time to hide
I'm alive on the inside
Breaking up my mind on the front lines
Will I survive? Will I survive another day?
This great divide
Side by side on the inside
Breaking up our minds on the front lines
Never again, never again will I be denied
Here I come

Cause here I come

I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what I believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches and stand up

Wake up, I won't give up
Cause here I come, here I come

Back and forth, stuck in a hole, damage control
Digging for rhymes on a secondhand cell phone
Will I survive? Will I survive another year?
Still month to month
Paying my dues on the inside
Breaking up my mind on the outside
Never again, never again will I be denied
Here I come

Cause here I come

I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what i believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches and stand up

Wake up, I won't give up

King & LionheartOf Monsters And Men,"[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Taking over this town, they should worry
But these problems aside, I think I taught you well
That we won't run, and we won't run, and we won't run

And in the winter night sky, ships are sailing
Looking down on these bright blue city lights
And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait
We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay

Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart

His crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
Past the wandering eyes of the ones that were left behind
Though far away, though far away, though far away
We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same

[Chorus 2: Nanna, Ragnar]
Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart

And in the sea that's painted black
Creatures lurk below the deck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart

And as the world comes to an end
I'll be here to hold your hand
'Cause you're my king and I'm your lionheart

What makes you want to carve your initials in me
Rained and weathered erasing hard to read
Find me distant, outwardly rough, obscene

MonsterImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in (Oh, oh, oh)
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in (Oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster

Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest?
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh, oh, oh)
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made its home inside (Oh, oh, oh)

Hail To The KingAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore
Royal flames will carve the path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night (Night)
Death is riding into town with armor
They come to take all your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)

Born again but it’s too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid
Let the water flow with shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light (Light)
Death is riding into town with armor
They come to grant you your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)

Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

[Pre-Chorus - Régine Chassagne]
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

[Pre-Chorus - Variation - Régine Chassagne]
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
Cause you're my home

[Chorus]
I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

[Bridge 1]
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
All right, let's go back

[Verse 3]
Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

[Chorus]
I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

[Bridge 2: Win Butler & David Bowie]
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)

[Outro]
It’s a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
It’s just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
We all got things to hide
It’s just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side"
BravadoLorde,"[Produced by Joel Little]

[Verse 1]
All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up to be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing to assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

[Beat Break]

[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that, when the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me but
I learned not to want the quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go ""oh""

[Beat Break]

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa

Million Dollar BillsLorde,"[Verse 1]
There's nothing I want but money and time
Million dollar bills and the tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel than only nine lives
Unlimited spines would do the trick-trick-trick-trick

[Chorus]
We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go

[Verse 2]
There's nothing as fun as coming untied
And running with the kids in the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt like letting you go
It's tiger burn eyes in the dark-dark-dark-dark

[Chorus]
We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with all our people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free-flow

[Outro]
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know"
SupersoakerKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
My motivation has gone too soon
Good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it, you mean it
You've got a story you never tell
Down in the delta I'm ringing bells
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind I'm on my way
I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Verse 2]
The flags are flying across the plains
I've got a secret picking at my brain
I wanna see you, see you
The exit sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place
I just wanna be there, be there

[Bridge]
Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line, on the line

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, oohhh"

[Verse 1]
We were just kids just living in wide-eyed innocence
Minivan floor like a tenement
We were just kids who believed in
More than just dreams in
More than just justified
Ends to a means
With the sky wide open

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a child, eyes-open
Like a child, unbroken
By the wheels gone by
We know

Who we are (We’ve got nothing left to lose)
Who we are (There’s still time enough to choose)

We were just kids
Just limited, misfit, itinerant
Outcasts singing bout the dissonance
We were just kids, wide-open

ElephantTame Impala,"[Verse 1]
Well, he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreamin' about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mister Shuck
To get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
He's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)

[Verse 2]
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (Yeah)
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing when they saw him again
That's how it is 'til the end (Yeah)"
Trying To Be CoolPhoenix,"[Verse 1]
City and desert coexist
Depending on the things you're wearing
Wildlife binoculars
Tell me that you want me

They teach you suffer to resist
Too much intention, Presbyterian
Mint julep testosterone
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want me

[Chorus]
Cool
I'm just trying to be cool
It's all because of you
Some fanatic attitude we're both on

[Post-Chorus]
Open for business says it all, you can't go wrong
Is innocent too immature where you’re from?
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want it all

Two dozen pink and white ranunculus
Why? What are the problems to solve?
To part-time holy bachelors
Tell them that you want me
Tell them that you want me

I'm just trying to be cool
It's all because of you
Some fanatic attitude we're both on

Open for business says it all, you can't go wrong
Compliments sound too cynical where you're from
Tell me that you want me
Tell me what they want is

Gruesome
I don't care where you're from
Nothing's that personal
There is no physical evidence of cannibal boyfriends

HurricaneMS MR,"[Verse 1]
Didn't know what this would be
But I knew I didn't see
What you thought
You saw in me
I jumped the gun
So sure you'd split and run
Ready for the worst
Before the damage was done

[Verse 2]
The storm never came
Or it never was
Didn't know getting lost in the blue
It meant I wound up losing you

[Chorus]
Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart
Hurricane

[Verse 3]
What's wrong with me
Why not understand and see
I never saw
What you saw in me
Keep my eyes open
My lips sealed
My heart closed
And my ears peeled

[Chorus]
Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart

Make ash and leave the dust behind
Lady diamond in the sky
Wild light
Glowing bright to guide me
When I fall
When I fall on tragedy

Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart

[Verse 1]
This is gospel, for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
The gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

[Chorus]
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-o-oh-oh-oh)

Led away by imperfect impostors

WildfireJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

[Chorus]
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

[Verse 2]
Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather
In his medicine bag

HomeJack Johnson,"[Verse]
I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
There's food on the ground and the birds have all moved back
Into my attic, whistling static when the young learn to fly
I will patch all the holes up again

Well, I can't believe that my lime tree is dead
I thought it was sleeping, I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too, I keep food in my belly
And hope that my time isn't soon, isn't soon

And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
Because this place is overgrown it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too

In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
We went walking so far that it grew back again
And there's no trail at all only grass growing taller
Get out my machete battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose because I'll be down if time don't win

I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
All the seeds from the fruits buried and began their
Own family trees teach them, thank you and please
They spread their own roots, then watch their young fruit grow again
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins

And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
Because this place is overgrown, it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
I said, Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too"
Mind Your MannersPearl Jam,"[Verse 1]
I've got an unfortunate feeling
I been beaten down
I feel that I'm done believing
Now the truth is coming out
What they've taken is more than a vow
They've taken your innocence
And then they throw em on a burning pile

[Chorus]
All along they're saying
""Mind your manners!""

[Verse 2]
I caught myself believing
That I needed God
And if it's out there somewhere
We sure could use hymn now
Try my patience!
My patience tried
This world's a long love letter
That makes me want to cry
Ah ah ay ay

[Chorus]
All along they're saying
""Mind your manners!""
That's all they're saying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And all along they're saying
Mind your manners
Always praying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

The Sound Of WinterBush,"[Verse 1]
Mind strong, body strong
Try to find equilibrium
Head straight, screwed on
We screwed up for too long
I don't want to lean on the waves
I watched the storm evaporate
I think of you and starry skies
That keeps you so alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's walk through the fire together
Disappear in the golden sands

It's all in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

Medusa smiles and Judas lips
Open arms and finger tips
Love bites, and recompense
I'll be with you until the end

Face To The FloorChevelle,"[Verse 1]
To pick up the tip doesn't mean a lot
Fiddle inside your drawers
If we own the night, then spread it out
Or pack up without a clue

Well, caused by their own
And by default
Time to vamanos

[Chorus]
Like your face getting forced to the floor

Then I got a taste of the benefits
Five foot and change
There's no better way to hash it out
So let's set up your time to fail

Well course now the cracks
Should we intervene?
I hold this albatross

Like your face getting forced to the floor
And either way, you're way too close to it all

Pay up, never wait 'em out
Clever, Madoff, take it all
Take it all

Take it all the way, right back down
(Clueless mess)
Pay up, never take it all
Take it all

Like your face getting forced to the floor
(In a league of your own)
And either way, you're way too close to it all

Getting forced (getting forced) to the floor
(In a league of your own)
And either way (and either way)
You're way too close to it all
Too close to it all"

WalkFoo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Gettin' good at startin' over
Every time that I return

I'm learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Do you remember the days
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn?
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growin' stronger?
Little conquerors

I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learnin' to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough

Now
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice but knowin' to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never want to die
I never want to die, I never want to die
I'm on my knees, I never want to die
I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire
Forever, whenever, I never want to die
I never want to leave, I never say goodbye
Forever, whenever, forever, whenever

TonightSeether,"I'm not gonna waste this
This opportunity's mine
I'm sick of complaining
About a beautiful life

How did we get here?
Did we forget all the things inside?
And how do we stay here?
Do we embrace all the things tonight?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older

For my entertainment
You tell a whimsical lie
To keep me complacent
You knock me down with a smile

How did we get here?
How do we pretend everything's alright?
And how do we stay here?
Do we erase all the fear inside?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older

Like sugar and cyanide
These worlds are gonna collide
I want to yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over and we're older

So take me
But go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this
Seed grow
Until we finally call this home

So take me
But go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this
Seed grow
Until we finally call this home

If I was to die tonight
Would it tear you apart?
Would you yell it from the rooftops down?
Until it's over and you're older

I feel so alive tonight
You've got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older

Like sugar and cyanide
Our worlds are meant to collide
I'm gonna yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over and we're older"
Monarchy Of RosesRed Hot Chili Peppers,"[Verse 1]
The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask, and are you up to task?
The calicos of Pettibon where cultures come to clash

[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to build it up
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

[Verse 2]
The cross between my former queen
Her legendary stare
The holy tears of Ireland
A lovely cross to bear

[Chorus 2]
Several of my best friends know
The secrets of this town
Mary wants to raise it up
And Sherry wants to spin it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear
The colours of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl

[Outro]
Hey, yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said hey, yeah
Show us love before you go

Hey, yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said hey, yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, then I say I want to
The story knows that I will always haunt you"
The Adventures Of Rain Dance MaggieRed Hot Chili Peppers,"[Verse 1]
Lipstick junkie
Debunk the all in one
She came back wearing a smile
Looking like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one in here is on trial
Its just a turn-around
And we go, oh
Well and we go, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tic-toc, I want to
Rock you like the '80s
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd?
We better get it on the go

[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

Rain dance Maggie advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know
Her body was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit

Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to

She knows how to make it loud

'Cause I’ll be gone, bye, bye, bye, yeah
Bye bye, bye, girl

Cough SyrupYoung The Giant,"[Verse 1]
Life's too short to even care at all, whoa oh-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control
These fishes in the sea, they're staring at me
Whoa oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum, oh-whoa oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some fortune that
I, I should have found
By now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down, come down

Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa, oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now
Out of the blue, oh-oh, oh-oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh-whoa, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun
Oh-whoa oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 2]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that

Buried AliveAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that you might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real
Still I'm on my way (On and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take

[Chorus]
Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

[Verse 2]
I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes)
Wash my view away

[Chorus]
Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever

[Bridge]
And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

[Verse 3]
Take you down now
Burn it all out
Throw you all around
Get your fucking hands off me!
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul

[Verse 4]
While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with hands of fate
Shame to find out when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within

[Outro]
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life (what’s it feel like?)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what’s it feel like?)
Die buried alive (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life
Die buried alive"
Shake It OutFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

[Verse 2]
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa (shake him off)

[Verse 3]
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
(shake him off)
And given half the chance, would I take any of it back
(shake him off)
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
(shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa

[Bridge]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Well, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me
Yeah

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

You've taken this step
In front of you, is further from the truth
And you fall apart in front of me again

Again!

Denial isn’t the way to forgiveness
You always swore that I was wrong!

Not again...
No taste for the crow you feed me
Not again...
It’s not a matter of if I care
Not again...
What an intricate web you're weaving
Again and again

So you tried not to follow
While the clock fails to sleep
So here we are, back where it began
And toe to toe I stand in front of you again

Again!

Denial isn’t the way to forgiveness
You always swore that I was wrong!

Sometimes life it takes you by the hair
Pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
Yeah I'd make it out just to fall on my head

Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show them what I choose, got nothin' to lose

I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again
You play the game but you kind of cut
Cause you're coming down hard, your joints are all stuck

I tried to say that it's not the only way
I never knew if I could face myself to change
You were pacing, I was insecure
Slip and fall, I'm dodging calls, hug the prison I've been living in

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, took a sip of something poisoned, poisoned

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don’t fall that way
Yeah yeah and I’m alright
I took a sip of something poisoned, took a sip of something poisoned, poisoned"
After MidnightBlink-182,"[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy
Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer when you're hurt, for real
Cause you were driving me crazy

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know? I'm here to stay

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy
I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know? I'm here to stay

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on"
AberdeenCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
I been trying real hard to, to realize
But some things take a long, long, long, long time
Long time

[Chorus]
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foamin' at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burn me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen!
Way back, way back, way back!

[Verse 2]
Never saw my dark side in-in your eyes
Back and forth, bloody fingers painting up the sky
The sky

[Chorus]
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foamin' at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
But you burn me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen!
Way back, way back, way back!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Ooh, ooh

Way back, way back, way back
Way back, way back, way back

SatelliteRise Against,"[Verse 1]
You can't feel the heat until you hold your hand over the flame
You have to cross the line just to remember where it lays
You won't know your worth now, son, until you take a hit
And you won't find the beat until you lose yourself in it

[Chorus]
That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

[Verse 2]
You can't fill your cup until you empty all it has
You can't understand what lays ahead if you don't understand the past
You'll never learn to fly until you're standing at the cliff
You can't truly love until you've given up on it

[Chorus]
That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

[Verse 3]
She told me she that she'd never face the world again
So I offered up a plan:

[Bridge]
We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night
We'll come clean and start over
The rest of our lives
When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind
It's not too late, we have the rest of our lives
We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night (we have the rest of our lives)
We'll come clean and start over
The rest of our lives
When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind (we have the rest of our lives)
It's not too late, we have the rest of our lives
The rest of our lives

[Chorus]
Because we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me (shine your light on me)
No we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny (shine your light on me)
I'm passing over you like a satellite
'cause these are the things that we can't deny, no
This is a life that you can't deny us now"
Remember EverythingFive Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
Oh, dear mother, I love you
I'm sorry, I wasn't good enough
Dear father, forgive me
'Cause in your eyes, I just never added up

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In my heart I know I failed you
But you left me here alone

[Chorus]
If I could hold back the rain, would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

[Verse 2]
Oh, dear brother, just don't hate me
For never standing by you or being by your side
Dear sister, please don't blame me
I only did what I thought was truly right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's a long and lonely road
When you know you walk alone

[Chorus]
If I could hold back the rain, would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

[Bridge]
I feel like running away, I'm still so far from home
You say that I'll never change, but what the fuck do you know?
I'll burn it all to the ground before I let you win
Please forgive me, I can't forgive you now
I remember everything

[Chorus]
If I could hold back the rain, would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

[Outro]
It all went by so fast
I still can't change the past
I always will remember
Everything
If we could start again
Would that have changed the end?
We remember
Everything
Everything"

Somebody That I Used To KnowGotye,"[Hook]

[Verse 1: Dcoy Link]
Good girls might scandal
When you ridin' bad bitches on your bike handle
When days are dark friends make like eggs and scramble
Life's a bitch but she pretty from the right angle
Guns blazing, that's how I'm going out
Niggas wishing I was gone should light a candle
Make a wish and blow it out
I'm no magician no pulling rabbits outta hats
But I could pull a dagger out and stab it in a back
I got 'em catchin' high notes and they don't sing too well
Don't trust friendship cause Ships sink and I don't swim too well
That nigga bitch got ass but he a bitch ass nigga
Put some money on her ass now she shit cash nigga
She hot as hell she probably the devil's bitch
But if I got her sucking mine then who's sucking the devil's dick
I'm like the twin towers right before they leveled it
I might just blow up but fuck it I ain't celibate
They making they breast bigga all these body building hoes
If I wasn't rapping i'd be lifting weights but I ain't talking body building though
I got the whip doing gymnastics
The wheels stop spinning then the top do a back flip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cas]
I believed in ya
Thought I really needed ya
Damn she a trip Travelocity, Expedia
Hella hard headed now let's make it way easier
You thought you knew it all call her mrs. Wikipedia
Thought she was a keepa
Promise to neva leava
But honestly I ain't good with promises and she ain't neither
You wanted me for yourself
I played along it didn't help
But I guess this what I do I cheetos, Chester cheetah
I ain't ashton kutcher and you ain't watching punk'd
Put her to the test and yeah she motherfuckin' flunked
I had her blowing on my shit like it's a blunt
I ain't taking shots at you this a slam dunk
But as far as the jokes go
She said I never find a chick like her
God I hope so
Had a chance but you blew it I'm not surprised
Though I made you cry I was just doing me cuz I'm obliged"
Curl Of The BurlMastodon,"I killed a man cause he killed my goat
I put my hands around his throat
He tried to reason with the sky and the clouds
But it didn't matter, cause they can't hear a sound

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

Splinters in my skin just like needles and pins
I cut through the pine, love the feeling it gives
But I'll never die, running through these streets
I'm using my hands, cutting through the disease

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

Bitch Came BackTheory Of A Deadman,"[Chorus:]
The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn't stay away
Don't you know the bitch came back?

[Verse 1:]
I like her so much better when she's down on her knees
Cause when she's in my face that's when I'm starting to see
That all my friends were right for thinking that we'd be wrong
Well she's so fuckin' stupid bet she's singing along
The trouble with girls is they're all the same
Forget the diamonds and pearls they just want a ring
Before you know it you're like a dog on a leash
Well you can try and change the world but you won't change me

[Chorus:]
The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn't stay away
Don't you know the bitch came back?

[Verse 2:]
There she goes again she's always breaking my balls
No matter what I do somehow it's always my fault
She says I must be cheating cause I turned off my phone
But that's the only frickin' way she'll leave me alone
The trouble with girls is it's never enough
They love to complain and they never shut up
They like to tell you the way it ought to be
Go on and tell the world but just don't tell me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
It ain't a joke when I say I wanna throw you out
(I really mean it, I really mean it)
Well look who's laughing now!
The bitch came, the bitch came back
The bitch came, the bitch came back
The bitch came, the bitch came back
She just couldn't stay away
The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she won't stay the fuck away

Set Fire To The RainAdele,"[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]
Oh, oh, no
Let it burn
Oh, oh, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn"
Bullet In My HandRedlight King,"I've got a fast life and
A slow cuttin' knife
I've been drinkin' at a poisoned well
No home and a bag of bones
And nothin' else left to sell
I know why I'm in this hell
I just don't wanna believe
Past that line you just can't tell
But right now

There's someone lookin' out for me
I came out of the darkness
With a bullet in my hand
I got one more shot at livin'
I'm lucky that I can
Cause I got a little roughed up
Yeah I really got fucked up
I came out of the darkness
With a bullet in my hand

I got a cold stare, the wound's still there
But there ain't much left to bleed
A short fuse that I still use
I'm my own worst enemy
Stare at the faces I once knew lined up just to bury me
There's a long black car that's waitin' to leave
But right now

There's someone looking out for me
I came out of the darkness
With a bullet in my hand
I got one more shot at livin'
I'm lucky that I can
Cause I got a little roughed up
Yeah I really got fucked up
I came out of the darkness
With a bullet in my hand

Cause I got a little roughed up
With a bullet in my hand
Yeah I really got fucked up
With a bullet in my hand

Can you see the light?
Can you see the light?
Can you see the light?
I can see the light

We Are Youngfun.,"[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

The WalkMayer Hawthorne,"[Intro]
So long you did me wrong
So long you did me wrong

[Verse 1]
Baby, whatcha doing now?
You’re pissin' me off
But your hair is so luxurious
And your lips are so soft

Anyway you slice it
You’re doing me wrong
But I love the way you walk now
And your legs are so long

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well your looks had me putty in your hand now
But I took just as much as I can stands now

[Chorus 1]
And you can walk your long legs baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong
Yeah you can walk your long legs baby right out of my life
(So long you did me wrong)

[Verse 2]
From the moment that I met you
I thought you were fine, so fine
But your shitty fuckin' attitude
Has got me changing my mind
Everybody tells me I need to let go, I know
But your cocoa butter skin now has got me beggin' for more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well your heels keep on running through my head now
I tried to deal but I’m coming to the edge now

[Chorus 2]
And you can walk those high heels baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong
Yeah you can walk those high heels baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong

[Bridge]
Tell me why
Why'd you turn the blues skies cloudy grey
You know I
I can’t let you keep treating me this way

[Verse 3]
You've been jerking me around but
I kept my eyes shut
Because you're shaped like an hourglass
But I think your time’s up

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Well your heart's like a blackened piece of coal now
And I doubt that you ever had a soul now

[Chorus 3]
And you can walk your cold heart baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong
Yeah you can walk your cold heart baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong
So long you did me wrong
Leave me alone
I'm better off on my own"
ColoursGrouplove,"[Verse 1]
I am a man, man man man
Up, up in the air
And I run around, round round
Round this town town
And act like I don't care
So when you see me flying by the planet's moon
You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know I'm just like you

[Verse 2]
So I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head
And I see black, black, green, and brown, brown, brown and blue
Yellow violets, red
And suddenly a light appears inside my brain
And I think of my ways, I think of my days
And know that I have changed

[Chorus]
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
You've still got your hands

[Verse 3]
So mistress, mistress have you been up to the roof?
He shot himself, self
There's blood on the wall
Cause he couldn't face the truth

Oh, knock that down, leave the ground and find some space
And tell your friends, friends
You'll be back again-gain
Before it's too late

[Chorus - modified]
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

[Chorus]
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

[Verse 4]
So I am a man, man, man, man
Up, up in the air
And I float around, round round
Round this town, town
And know I shouldn't care
So when you see us there, there out in the open road
You don't need to explain
If everything's changed
Just know that you don't know

[Outro]
We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
We can't call it at all
We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
When you can't call it at all
Yeah, we call it
Oh yeah that's what we call it
Ohhh
Yeah that's right, we call it
Ohhh
We do it for love, sweet love"
HellDisturbed,"[Intro]
Hell!
Burning now I bring you hell
Oh, burning now I bring you hell

[Verse 1]
Read me tonight, when the warnings said leave a shudder upon you
Running from all that you feared in your life
Soul of the night, when the sun mislead in a horror upon you
Marking the moment, displaying in my ghost of a life
And I can’t get 'round the way you left me out in the open
To leave me to die
So how can I
Forget the way you lead me through the path into heaven
To leave me behind?

[Chorus 1]
Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you hell

[Refrain]
Oh, burning now I bring you hell

[Verse 2]
Free me tonight, as the animal kings breathe their terror upon you
Caught in the moment, engaging in my
Bloodlust tonight, now I can’t control my venom’s flow
Get back from me demon, or be exorcised!

[Chorus 1]
Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you hell

All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you’ve taken from me
All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you’ve taken from me

Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Soul of the night, I know

Upon you, to killing more than I can tell

UndergroundJane's Addiction,"I try and find some love from up high
There just ain't enough to go around

How you doing bro- is New York
Holding you up, or is it letting you down?
I have missed all you heaps and I've re-
Planted my feet back in the underground

I'm a hustler
Hustler!
I'll never give up the underground

I came back to pay respect
To another falling angel at the old canteen
Someone had to float the cash
To pay up for the wake and so we all agreed

We're all hustlers
Hustlers!

I try and find some love from up high
There just ain't enough to go around
Someone had to pay up for the wakes
Taking place down in the underground

Come on
I couldn't get up

We're all hustlers
Hustlers!

I try and find some love from up high
There just ain't enough to go around
Someone had to pay up for the wakes
Taking place down in the underground"
Lucky NowRyan Adams,"[Verse 1]
I don’t remember, were we wild and young
All that's faded into memory
I feel like somebody I don’t know
Are we really who we used to be?
Am I really who I was?

[Chorus]
The lights will draw you in
And the dark will bring you down
And the night will break your heart
But only if you’re lucky now

[Verse 2]
Waiting outside while you find your keys
Like bags of trash in the blackening snow
City of neon and toes that freeze
We’ve got nothing and nowhere to go
We’ve got nothing and nowhere

[Chorus]
And the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down
And the night will break your heart
But only if you’re lucky now

And if the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down
And love can mend your heart
But only if you’re lucky now

All that’s faded into memory

Am I really who I was?"
Eyes Wide OpenStaind,"The hating and the waiting, hesitating
I just wanna be done with you
Faking for the taking but I'm waking…
Up to the fact that you're lying and denying
Justifying all the actions you take
It's pathetic and poetic

It's just SICK!
It's just SICK!

Is ""compromise"" something you don't understand?
You force your hand but my eyes are wide open
Caught in the web of your self-serving plan
Don't force my hand when my eyes are wide open

Seeing is believing, now I'm leaving
All the damage is done
You've broken any notion of trust
Cause you're lying and denying
Justifying all the actions you take
It's pathetic and poetic

It's just SICK!
It's just SICK!

Is ""compromise"" something you don't understand?
You force your hand but my eyes are wide open
Caught in the web of your self-serving plan
Don't force my hand when my eyes are wide open

Seeing is believing, now I'm leaving
All the damage is done

All the damage DONE!

All the damage DONE!

Is ""compromise"" something you don't understand?
You force your hand but my eyes are wide open
Caught in the web of your self-serving plan
Don't force my hand when my eyes are wide open

Don't force my hand when my eyes are wide open
(Force my hand…)

The lying and denying is just sick!
The lying and denying is just sick!
It's just sick!"
Called Out In The DarkSnow Patrol,"[Verse 1]
It's like we just can't help ourselves
Cause we don't know how to back down
We were called out to the streets
We were called out to the towns
How the heavens they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain-washed histories
Well, we do not need to be told

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

[Chorus]
We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

[Verse 2]
I was called out in the dark
By a choir of beautiful cheats
And as the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

[Chorus]
We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this is your time
We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this is your time"
HeartbeatThe Fray,"[Verse 1]
We're on an open bed truck on the highway
Rain is coming down and we're on the run
Think I can feel the breath in your body
We got to keep on running 'til we see the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fire and it's burning in the rain
Thought that it went out but it's burning just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause if you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

[Chorus]
I feel your heartbeat
You're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same

I'm trying to put it all back together
I got a story and I'm trying to tell it right
I got the kerosene and the desire
I'm trying to start a flame in the heart of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you got a fire and it's burnin' in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause if you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

You're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same

I want to kiss your scars tonight
You got to try, you got to let me in

You got to love somebody, you love them all the same

UndoneAranda,"When I close my eyes
If only for a moment
I can see the light
But the darkness is callin’
Pulling me down, taking me under
The emptiness below
Can’t hold it back, I’m letting go
Of the innocence again

If you ever feel ashamed
Like you're the one to blame
And the weight of all the world
Is on your shoulders crushing you
When the walls are closing in
You gotta fight it from within
Will you rise above the pain
Or will you simply come undone

Every single lie
Every promise broken
Leads me to the other side
Of a life going nowhere
Pulling me down, taking me under
The emptiness below
Can’t hold it back, can’t let it go
Will I ever live again?

If you ever feel ashamed
Like you're the one to blame
And the weight of all the world
Is on your shoulders crushing you
When the walls are closing in
You gotta fight it from within
Will you rise above the pain
Or will you simply come undone

I found a little salvation there under the midnight sun
I gotta fight this fear inside of me
Cuz I got nowhere to run

If you ever feel ashamed
Like you're the one to blame
And the weight of all the world
Is on your shoulders crushing you
When the walls are closing in
You gotta fight it from within
Will you rise above the pain
Or will you simply come undone

Will you rise above the pain
Or come undone"

Look at the horizon glow

Waiting for a word
Looking at the milky skyline
The city is my church
It wraps me in its blinding twilight

I am the waiting one it seems
Days grow somber quickly
Now how the quiet is release
And I feel so lonely

How did you think I would feel
Throw me aside again
How did you think I would feel
I won't let you hurt me again now

[Chorus]
I'm nothing to you I can see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn apart I can't believe
You'd stand and watch me bleed

[Verse 1]
She was the one thing I believed
That I needed to hold me
Still I can smell her hear her breath
Feel her body beside me

How long I've waited, waited for you
To come back to hold me
What should I, what should I, what should I do
When I feel so lonely?

How could you do this to me?
Betrayed by my closest friend
How could you do this to me?
I won't let you hurt me again now

Just walk away from me
I'm torn apart I can't believe
You'd stand and watch me bleed

What can I, what can I do
When I feel so lonely?

Had a dream
You and me in the war of the end times
And I believe

We heaved relief
As scores of innocents died

Setting the lea of Nebraska alight
Till all that remains is the arms of the angels

Queen of supply-side bonhomie bone-drab

In the year of the chewable Ambien tab

Stands at the Dowager Empress's side
And all that remains is the arms of the angels
And all that remains is the arms of the angels

And they're picking at your bones

Quiet now
Will we gather to conjure the rain down?
Will we now
Build a civilization below ground?
And I'll be crowned the community kick-it-around

Setting the lea of Nebraska alight
'Til all that remains is the arms of the angels
'Til all that remains is the arms of the angels

All I Ever WantedThe Airborne Toxic Event,"I can only say these things to you while you’re sleeping
I hear the hum from the wires, the sounds of the morning creeping
I lie awake and pretend you can hear me

You tell me that you’re scared that you’re turning into your mother
I feel myself turning into my father
We could lie to each other like they do and say we’re so happy
It’s easy when you’re young and you still want it so badly

And I feel my heart pounding
And I think I might scream...

I can tell you that you’re all I’ve ever wanted, dear
I can utter every word you’ve ever hoped to hear
I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

In the night you whisper like a ghost and you look so shaken
You're so quiet and small and you tell me you want to be taken
I just never think of you as the kind of girl who would say that
And you suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp

Your eyes alight, your face aglow
It's the face of someone I don't know

I can tell that you’re all I’ve ever wanted, dear
I can utter every word you’ve ever hoped to hear
I shudder when I think I might not be here forever, forever, forever

And all I can think is that it must be a kind of rebellion
To arm your fears like soldiers and slay them

I can tell that you’re all I’ve ever wanted, dear
Through the din while you're breathing, while you're sleeping here
You wake and you ask me if I'm gonna be here forever, forever, forever

Your face so twisted and your eyes alight
I want to tell you I can change you when you cry at night
But I'd be lying
Love is defying"

Hey!
Hey!

It’s 8 A.M

Seems I’ve crossed the line again
For being nothing more than who I am

So break my bones
And throw your stones
We all know that life ain’t fair
But there is more of us
We’re everywhere

We don’t have to take this
Back against the wall
We don’t have to take this

All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt

Can you hear me?
No one's gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

Hey!
Hey!

Think it through
You can’t undo
Whenever I see black and blue
I feel the past
I share the bruise

With everyone
Who’s come and gone
My head is clear
My voice is strong
Now I’m right here to right the wrong

We don’t have to take this

Simple SongThe Shins,"[Verse 1]
Well this is just a simple song
To say what you done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Made warm by the sun

When I was just nine-years-old
I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest;
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest

[Chorus]
I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone
Could be there’s nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

[Verse 2]
My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift!
You tell me with your tongue
And your breath was in my lungs
And we float up through the rift

[Chorus]
I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone
Could be there's nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

Well this would be a simple song
To say what you done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong

Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark

[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

[Bridge]
Never thought I'd live
To see the day
When everybody's words
Got in the way

[Verse 3]
Hey sugar show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey sugar what you gotta say?

[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks back

[Outro]
It started with a whisper
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
And that was when I kissed her
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
Everybody talks
Everybody talks back"
FreeGraffiti6,"If I lay my head down on you
Would it be, would it be too late?
'Cause you were my protection from the rain outside
You made me feel love like the old days

But I can't blame you, baby
It's me that's done wrong
'Cause I broke the skies that shined above

I can't live without you, without you
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near
But I can't lie here beside you, beside you
'Cause you steal my soul when you leave

Set me free, babe
Set me free
Set me free, babe

I need someone to hold me
Wrap their arms and embrace the air I breathe
'Cause you were my shelter
Now the heart you hold is somebody else's, baby

Now I can't make you love me, baby, if you don't
But I'll stay in love, in love with you

'Cause I can't live without you, without you
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near
But I can't lie here beside you, beside you
'Cause you steal my soul when you leave

Set me free, babe
Oh, set me free
Set me free, baby
Set me free

Don't you know that I can't live without you, without you
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near, oh yes it is
But I can't lie here beside you, beside you
'Cause you steal my soul when you leave

Set me free, babe
Set me free, babe
Set me free, baby

You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees

You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees"
We Take Care Of Our OwnBruce Springsteen,"I been knocking on the door that holds the throne
I been looking for the map that leads me home
I been stumbling on good hearts turned to stone
The road of good intentions has gone dry as a bone
We take care of our own
We take care of our own
Wherever this flag's flown
We take care of our own

From Chicago to New Orleans, from the muscle to the bone
From the shotgun shack to the Superdome
There ain't no help, the cavalry stayed home
There ain't no one hearing the bugle blowin'
We take care of our own
We take care of our own
Wherever this flag's flown
We take care of our own

Where're the eyes, the eyes with the will to see
Where're the hearts that run over with mercy
Where's the love that has not forsaken me
Where's the work that set my hands, my soul free
Where's the spirit that'll reign, reign over me
Where's the promise from sea to the shining sea
Where's the promise from sea to the shining sea
Wherever this flag is flown
Wherever this flag is flown
Wherever this flag is flown

We take care of our own
We take care of our own
Wherever this flag's flown
We take care of our own
We take care of our own
We take care of our own
Wherever this flag's flown
We take care of our own"
Drive ByTrain,"[Verse 1]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

[Verse 2]
On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

[Bridge]
Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

[Pre-Chorus]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause...

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by"
I Like ItFoxy Shazam,"Big magic woman

Under your spell
You hypnotize

Charlie BrownColdplay,"[Intro]
Oooo, wooo

[Verse 1]
Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

[Hook]
Oooo-ooo-ooo

[Verse 2]
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We’ll run wild
We’ll be glowing in the dark

Oooo-ooo-ooo
We’ll be glowing in the dark
A-woo,-a-wooooo

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world

All the highs, all the lows

So we’ll soar
Luminous and wired

BaCome Home',"Look, check it out

There's a whole lot of girls messin' around
Trying to get me
They do things 'cause they know
My girl is away, they try to upset me

They can't believe I resist
How can I hold out, where is that girl now
But the truth really is I don't worry
'Cause I love you, baby, so

And no matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright till my baby comes home

If she stays away for long
She calls me on the phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright till my baby comes home

I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin', head gets to achin'
Is she thinkin' of me or feelin' the fire
With some other guy, yeah

I can't believe I can be worried about her
I shouldn't doubt her
'Cause our thing is for real
And I don't worry, 'cause I know, I know, I know

And no matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright till my baby comes home

If she stays away for long
She calls me on the phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright till my baby comes home

Bring it on home to me
She makes everything alright
She's good to me
She's the best part of my life

Yeah, can't you tell
That I'm just like a new guy
I'm doing very well
'Cause I know she's coming back tonight

I can't wait, can't wait, can't wait now
I can't wait, can't wait now

Every night when I sleep
I dream of my baby
She's such a lady
Then I wake up and see
That she's laying by me
Right there beside me

I can't explain how I fell
I really love her, keep dreaming of her
'Cause our love is for real
And I don't worry, 'cause I know, I know, I know

And no matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright till my baby comes home

If she stays away for long
She calls me on the phone
I jump up when I hear her voice

Roar at the door
My mind can't take much more

Love InterruptionJack White,"I want love
To roll me over slowly
Stick a knife inside me
And twist it all around

I want love to
Grab my fingers gently
Slam them in a doorway
Put my face into the ground

I want love to
Murder my own mother
And take her off to somewhere
Like hell or up above

An' I want love to
Change my friends to enemies
Change my friends to enemies
And show me how it's all my fault

I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
Yeah, I won't let love disrupt, corrupt, or interrupt me anymore

I want love to
Walk right up and bite me
Grab a hold of me and fight me
Leave me dyin' on the ground

And I want love to
Split my mouth wide open and
Cover up my ears
And never let me hear a sound

I want love to
Forget that you offended me
Or how you have defended me
When everybody tore me down

Yeah, I want love to
Change my friends to enemies
Change my friends to enemies
And show me how it's all my fault

Look AroundRed Hot Chili Peppers,"[Verse 1]
Stiff club, its my nature
Custom love is the nomenclature
Turn down mass confusion
Hit the road 'cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision
Long hard look at my last decision
Hustle here, hustle there
Hustle me bitch and you best beware

[Refrain]
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know, so I told you

[Verse 2]
Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This is for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will

[Chorus]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around

[Refrain]
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you

[Verse 3]
Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street life out my window
City made breeze gonna stroke my skindow
Just a lot of words on an old brick wall
Rob a lot of banks, got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care

Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!

Love Bites (So Do I)Halestorm,"[Intro]
One, two, one, two
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Don't listen what your girlfriend says
She reads those magazines
That say you failed the test
You don't have what she needs
I slither like a viper and get you by the neck
I know a thousand ways to help you forget about her

[Chorus 1]
That bitch can eat her heart out
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites

[Verse 2]
My lips are pale and vicious
You're foamin' out the mouth
You've suffered in the darkness
I'll suck the pain right out
So come and taste the reason, I'm nothin' like the rest
I kiss you in a way, you'll never forget about me

[Chorus 2]
That chick can eat her heart out
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I

[Bridge]
It sucks you in and kicks you down
And chews you up and spits you out
It messes with your sanity by twisting all your thoughts around
They say it’s blind, they say it waits
But every time it seals your fate
Now it's got you by the balls and won't let go until you fall
I was down and out, got up, and said
“Hey love, I've had enough”
I've felt pleasure without pain
My soul you'll never tame

[Chorus 3]
Love bites, but so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I

This Means WarNickelback,"[Verse 1]
Climb into the ring for a battle that you can't win
Swing as hard as you can swing, it will still mean nothing
Should’ve seen it coming, it had to happen sometime
But you went and brought a knife to an all out gun fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

[Chorus]
You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war

[Verse 2]
Say anything you want, but talk will get you nowhere
The only thing you've brought was psychological warfare
Well, there’s no getting out
And now you gotta wonder
Who will dig you out when you’re six feet under?

[Pre-Chorus]
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

[Chorus]
You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war

[Pre-Chorus]
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?

Well, this means war"
HurricaneTheory Of A Deadman,"I should have known these walls would cave in
I should have never left my heart there on the line
Cause when the shit hit the fan
All we ever had ended up lost in the fire
And now nothing's saved, nothing's gained
Was it all in vain?
Cause I'm standing in the eye of the storm
And everything I've known is blowin' away (blowin' away)

I'm caught in a hurricane
I'm leaving here dead or alive
And I know that I'd be willing to feel the pain
If it got me to the other side
Cause I only hurt
Oh, hurricane
Yeah I can feel it hurt
Oh, hurricane

Remember how we were, we really were
Before this disaster came and tore us apart
It was the two of us, that was enough
The two of us, so in love
Til the window of lies
The rain of cries and lightning strikes
And now we're standing in the eye of the storm
And everything is gone, nothing remains (I'm blowing away)

I'm caught in a hurricane
I'm leaving here dead or alive
And I know that I'd be willing to feel the pain
If it got me to the other side
Cause I only hurt
Oh, hurricane
Yeah I can feel it hurt
Oh, hurricane

I never thought it would end
You'll never understand
How we let it end
Like this

I'm caught in a hurricane
I'm leaving here dead or alive
And I know that I'd be willing to feel the pain
If it got me to the other side
Cause I only hurt
Oh, hurricane
Yeah I can feel it hurt
Oh, hurricane

Hurt

Boss's DaughterPop Evil,"That girl, she's a loaded gun
Gonna take 'em out take 'em one by one
She knows when she's dressed to kill
She'll put a bullet in your heart just to feel the thrill

She walks like she's walkin' on water
She moves like the boss's daughter
She rides like a '67 Chevy
In her drop top red and white and blue

Ohhh, what she does to me
With her long dark hair and her sexy thighs
Baby let me come inside

Cuz she's hell on heels
And she turns my wheels
With her devil smile and her angel eyes
She got me all hypnotized
And she's hell on heels

That girl needs somebody like me
A real man born with a sex degree
I was raised by the devil's own kin
Taught me that a good time was never a sin

She walks like she's walkin' on water
She moves like the boss's daughter
She rides like a '67 Chevy
In her drop top red and white and blue

Ohhh, what she does to me

Baby let me come inside

Cuz she's hell on heels
And she turns my wheels
With her devil smile and her angel eyes
She got me all hypnotized
And she's hell on heels

I love the way she moves those heels from hell
Lunch breaks lead to drinks in cheap hotels
I'm just another guy she'll burn inside her fire
I'd sell my soul for her desire

With her long dark hair and her sexy thighs
Baby let me come inside

Cuz she's hell on heels
And she turns my wheels
With her devil smile and her angel eyes
She got me all hypnotized
She's hell on heels

And she's hell on heels
She's hell on her heels
You got me got me
With your devil smile and her angel eyes
She got me all hypnotized
She's hell on heels"
Burn It DownLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down

And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down

And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground"

Who held the sum with everything you knew

Was everything I need to pass the test?
And if I fail, what happens then?
Can I still count on you as a friend?

Days Go ByThe Offspring,"[Verse 1]
Run to the light
It won't save you tonight
All our yesterdays are pictures lost in time
Never enough
Towers crumble to dust
Looking back on the moments of our lives

[Chorus]
All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again

Those days go by

Stars still burn bright
Seasons change overnight
As we find our way, the times, they come and go
Look back in love
A new day rises above
With a wind that comes to carry you back home

All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again

Days go by!

And we all start again

What you had and what you lost
What you had and what you lost

Hats Off To The BullChevelle,"[Verse 1]
All our needs put together
Don't bleed on their own
You paid for an eyeful
So behold the bull

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can't I look up (out in the clearing)
Tell me what's there below (end over end)
While he's safe for the moment (guess what he's learning)
He's never safe from the crowd

So hats off to the bull, no giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends?

To be monumental
Could mean the beyond
The simpler the treasure
Means the higher the cost

Well as for the ending (damn right I'm learning)
You might ask for the door (end over end)
Well I hate how the clouds hide
The gasps from above

So hats off to the bull, no giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends?

Find your challenge, suffer miles
Colors grey, he brings them out
Don't mind the challenge, suffer miles
A little shallow, if I don't say

Hats off to the bull, his time ain't up
Bitter hell in the lion's den, for some of us
Hats off to the bull, the sun won't set
'Til the pain and the final breath

So hats off to the bull, no giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends?

Hats off to the bull, no giving up
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all

You're A LieSlash,"[Verse 1]
You’re the voice of reason that I can’t escape
Cut me down a thousand times a day
I don’t need you anymore
I don’t need you anymore
I trusted you when there was no one else
All you did was make me doubt myself
Don’t believe you anymore
Don’t believe you anymore
You bled me out, you tore me down
Your time has come, you can go

Because you’re a lie (Lie), lie (Lie)
All my faith has been wasted, wasted
Because you’re a lie (Lie), lie (Lie)
I won’t sit here and take this anymore

I’m fragile, but I’m not a fool
I won’t hear another word from you
You won’t hurt me anymore
You won’t hurt me anymore
The hand I held just held me down
It took so long, now I know

[Chorus]
Because you’re a lie (Lie), lie (Lie)
All my faith has been wasted, wasted
Because you’re a lie (Lie), lie (Lie)
I won’t sit here and take this anymore

You can say anything that you want to say
But my intention’s long gone and turned away
You’re such a lie, you were only the enemy
Everything you are I will deny

Bloody Mary (Nerve Endings)Silversun Pickups,"[Verse 1]
Drowned you out
And left you with the sounds
Of spoiled goodnights
Replacing lullabies

How could they never notice
What they planted in your spades?
See you laughing in a picture
But I know what's out of frame

You barely cried
But you made it out alive
And I'm so proud
That you're in my hands now

If we grew up together
You would find it's not the same
I wanna jump inside that picture
And show you a new game

[Chorus]
If you can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
Say her name into the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
She can chase us through the dark
Activate our nerve endings

We'll stay...

[Verse 2]
I'll never let them get closer
Or shower you with any blame
Now we dance in our own picture
Where the rules have changed

[Chorus]
If you can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
Say her name into the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
She can chase us through the dark
Activate our nerve endings

We'll stay..."

Spread Too ThinThe Dirty Heads,"At the time when these things took place, there were as yet on the frontiers neither custom-house officials nor guards—those bugbears of enterprising people—so that any one could bring across anything he fancied. If any one made a search or inspection, he did it chiefly for his own pleasure, especially if there happened to be in the waggon objects attractive to his eye, and if his own hand possessed a certain weight and power. But the bricks found no admirers, and they entered the principal gate unmolested. Bulba, in his narrow cage, could only hear the noise, the shouts of the driver, and nothing more. Yankel, bouncing up and down on his dust-covered nag, turned, after making several detours, into a dark, narrow street bearing the names of the Muddy and also of the Jews' street, because Jews from nearly every part of Warsaw were to be found here. This street greatly resembled a back-yard turned wrong side out. The sun never seemed to shine into it. The black wooden houses, with numerous poles projecting from the windows, still further increased the darkness. Rarely did a brick wall gleam red among them; for these too, in many places, had turned quite black. Here and there, high up, a bit of stuccoed wall illumined by the sun glistened with intolerable whiteness. Pipes, rags, shells, broken and discarded tubs: every one flung whatever was useless to him into the street, thus affording the passer-by an opportunity of exercising all his five senses with the rubbish. A man on horseback could almost touch with his hand the poles thrown across the street from one house to another, upon which hung Jewish stockings, short trousers, and smoked geese. Sometimes a pretty little Hebrew face, adorned with discoloured pearls, peeped out of an old window. A group of little Jews, with torn and dirty garments and curly hair, screamed and rolled about in the dirt. A red-haired Jew, with freckles all over his face which made him look like a sparrow's egg, gazed from a window. He addressed Yankel at once in his gibberish, and Yankel at once drove into a court-yard. Another Jew came along, halted, and entered into conversation. When Bulba finally emerged from beneath the bricks, he beheld three Jews talking with great warmth.

Yankel turned to him and said that everything possible would be done; that his Ostap was in the city jail, and that although it would be difficult to persuade the jailer, yet he hoped to arrange a meeting.

Bulba entered the room with the three Jews.

The Jews again began to talk among themselves in their incomprehensible tongue. Taras looked hard at each of them. Something seemed to have moved him deeply; over his rough and stolid countenance a flame of hope spread, of hope such as sometimes visits a man in the last depths of his despair; his aged heart began to beat violently as though he had been a youth.

""Listen, Jews!"" said he, and there was a triumphant ring in his words. ""You can do anything in the world, even extract things from the bottom of the sea; and it has long been a proverb, that a Jew will steal from himself if he takes a fancy to steal. Set my Ostap at liberty! give him a chance to escape from their diabolical hands. I promised this man five thousand ducats; I will add another five thousand: all that I have, rich cups, buried gold, houses, all, even to my last garment, I will part with; and I will enter into a contract with you for my whole life, to give you half of all the booty I may gain in war.""

""Oh, impossible, dear lord, it is impossible!"" said Yankel with a sigh.

""Impossible,"" said another Jew.

All three Jews looked at each other.

""We might try,"" said the third, glancing timidly at the other two. ""God may favour us.""

All three Jews discussed the matter in German. Bulba, in spite of his straining ears, could make nothing of it; he only caught the word ""Mardokhai"" often repeated.

""Listen, my lord!"" said Yankel. ""We must consult with a man such as there never was before in the world... ugh, ugh! as wise as Solomon; and if he will do nothing, then no one in the world can. Sit here: this is the key; admit no one."" The Jews went out into the street.

Taras locked the door, and looked out from the little window upon the dirty Jewish street. The three Jews halted in the middle of the street and began to talk with a good deal of warmth: a fourth soon joined them, and finally a fifth. Again he heard repeated, ""Mardokhai, Mardokhai!"" The Jews glanced incessantly towards one side of the street; at length from a dirty house near the end of it emerged a foot in a Jewish shoe and the skirts of a caftan. ""Ah! Mardokhai, Mardokhai!"" shouted the Jews in one voice. A thin Jew somewhat shorter than Yankel, but even more wrinkled, and with a huge upper lip, approached the impatient group; and all the Jews made haste to talk to him, interrupting each other. During the recital, Mardokhai glanced several times towards the little window, and Taras divined that the conversation concerned him.

Mardokhai waved his hands, listened, interrupted, spat frequently to one side, and, pulling up the skirts of his caftan, thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out some jingling thing, showing very dirty trousers in the operation. Finally all the Jews set up such a shouting that the Jew who was standing guard was forced to make a signal for silence, and Taras began to fear for his safety; but when he remembered that Jews can only consult in the street, and that the demon himself cannot understand their language, he regained his composure.

Two minutes later the Jews all entered the room together. Mardokhai approached Taras, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, ""When we set to work it will be all right."" Taras looked at this Solomon whom the world had never known and conceived some hope: indeed, his face might well inspire confidence. His upper lip was simply an object of horror; its thickness being doubtless increased by adventitious circumstances. This Solomon's beard consisted only of about fifteen hairs, and they were on the left side. Solomon's face bore so many scars of battle, received for his daring, that he had doubtless lost count of them long before, and had grown accustomed to consider them as birthmarks.

Mardokhai departed, accompanied by his comrades, who were filled with admiration at his wisdom. Bulba remained alone. He was in a strange, unaccustomed situation for the first time in his life; he felt uneasy. His mind was in a state of fever. He was no longer unbending, immovable, strong as an oak, as he had formerly been: but felt timid and weak. He trembled at every sound, at every fresh Jewish face which showed itself at the end of the street. In this condition he passed the whole day. He neither ate nor drank, and his eye never for a moment left the small window looking on the street. Finally, late at night, Mardokhai and Yankel made their appearance. Taras's heart died within him.

""What news? have you been successful?"" he asked with the impatience of a wild horse.

But before the Jews had recovered breath to answer, Taras perceived that Mardokhai no longer had the locks, which had formerly fallen in greasy curls from under his felt cap. It was evident that he wished to say something, but he uttered only nonsense which Taras could make nothing of. Yankel himself put his hand very often to his mouth as though suffering from a cold.

""Oh, dearest lord!"" said Yankel: ""it is quite impossible now! by heaven, impossible! Such vile people that they deserve to be spit upon! Mardokhai here says the same. Mardokhai has done what no man in the world ever did, but God did not will that it should be so. Three thousand soldiers are in garrison here, and to-morrow the prisoners are all to be executed.""

Taras looked the Jew straight in the face, but no longer with impatience or anger.

""But if my lord wishes to see his son, then it must be early to-morrow morning, before the sun has risen. The sentinels have consented, and one gaoler has promised. But may he have no happiness in the world, woe is me! What greedy people! There are none such among us: I gave fifty ducats to each sentinel and to the gaoler.""

""Good. Take me to him!"" exclaimed Taras, with decision, and with all his firmness of mind restored. He agreed to Yankel's proposition that he should disguise himself as a foreign count, just arrived from Germany, for which purpose the prudent Jew had already provided a costume. It was already night. The master of the house, the red-haired Jew with freckles, pulled out a mattress covered with some kind of rug, and spread it on a bench for Bulba. Yankel lay upon the floor on a similar mattress. The red-haired Jew drank a small cup of brandy, took off his caftan, and betook himself—looking, in his shoes and stockings, very like a lean chicken—with his wife, to something resembling a cupboard. Two little Jews lay down on the floor beside the cupboard, like a couple of dogs. But Taras did not sleep; he sat motionless, drumming on the table with his fingers. He kept his pipe in his mouth, and puffed out smoke, which made the Jew sneeze in his sleep and pull his coverlet over his nose. Scarcely was the sky touched with the first faint gleams of dawn than he pushed Yankel with his foot, saying: ""Rise, Jew, and give me your count's dress!""

In a moment he was dressed. He blackened his moustache and eyebrows, put on his head a small dark cap; even the Cossacks who knew him best would not have recognised him. Apparently he was not more than thirty-five. A healthy colour glowed on his cheeks, and his scars lent him an air of command. The gold-embroidered dress became him extremely well.

The streets were still asleep. Not a single one of the market folk as yet showed himself in the city, with his basket on his arm. Yankel and Bulba made their way to a building which presented the appearance of a crouching stork. It was large, low, wide, and black; and on one side a long slender tower like a stork's neck projected above the roof. This building served for a variety of purposes; it was a barrack, a jail, and the criminal court. The visitors entered the gate and found themselves in a vast room, or covered courtyard. About a thousand men were sleeping here. Straight before them was a small door, in front of which sat two sentries playing at some game which consisted in one striking the palm of the other's hand with two fingers. They paid little heed to the new arrivals, and only turned their heads when Yankel said, ""It is we, sirs; do you hear? it is we.""

""Go in!"" said one of them, opening the door with one hand, and holding out the other to his comrade to receive his blows.

They entered a low and dark corridor, which led them to a similar room with small windows overhead. ""Who goes there?"" shouted several voices, and Taras beheld a number of warriors in full armour. ""We have been ordered to admit no one.""

""It is we!"" cried Yankel; ""we, by heavens, noble sirs!"" But no one would listen to him. Fortunately, at that moment a fat man came up, who appeared to be a commanding officer, for he swore louder than all the others.

""My lord, it is we! you know us, and the lord count will thank you.""

""Admit them, a hundred fiends, and mother of fiends! Admit no one else. And no one is to draw his sword, nor quarrel.""

The conclusion of this order the visitors did not hear. ""It is we, it is I, it is your friends!"" Yankel said to every one they met.

""Well, can it be managed now?"" he inquired of one of the guards, when they at length reached the end of the corridor.

""It is possible, but I don't know whether you will be able to gain admission to the prison itself. Yana is not here now; another man is keeping watch in his place,"" replied the guard.

""Ai, ai!"" cried the Jew softly: ""this is bad, my dear lord!""

""Go on!"" said Taras, firmly, and the Jew obeyed.

At the arched entrance of the vaults stood a heyduke, with a moustache trimmed in three layers: the upper layer was trained backwards, the second straight forward, and the third downwards, which made him greatly resemble a cat.

The Jew shrank into nothing and approached him almost sideways: ""Your high excellency! High and illustrious lord!""

""Are you speaking to me, Jew?""

""To you, illustrious lord.""

""Hm, but I am merely a heyduke,"" said the merry-eyed man with the triple-tiered moustache.

""And I thought it was the Waiwode himself, by heavens! Ai, ai, ai!"" Thereupon the Jew twisted his head about and spread out his fingers. ""Ai, what a fine figure! Another finger's-breadth and he would be a colonel. The lord no doubt rides a horse as fleet as the wind and commands the troops!""

The heyduke twirled the lower tier of his moustache, and his eyes beamed.

""What a warlike people!"" continued the Jew. ""Ah, woe is me, what a fine race! Golden cords and trappings that shine like the sun; and the maidens, wherever they see warriors—Ai, ai!"" Again the Jew wagged his head.

The heyduke twirled his upper moustache and uttered a sound somewhat resembling the neighing of a horse.

""I pray my lord to do us a service!"" exclaimed the Jew: ""this prince has come hither from a foreign land, and wants to get a look at the Cossacks. He never, in all his life, has seen what sort of people the Cossacks are.""

The advent of foreign counts and barons was common enough in Poland: they were often drawn thither by curiosity to view this half-Asiatic corner of Europe. They regarded Moscow and the Ukraine as situated in Asia. So the heyduke bowed low, and thought fit to add a few words of his own.

""I do not know, your excellency,"" said he, ""why you should desire to see them. They are dogs, not men; and their faith is such as no one respects.""

""You lie, you son of Satan!"" exclaimed Bulba. ""You are a dog yourself! How dare you say that our faith is not respected? It is your heretical faith which is not respected.""

""Oho!"" said the heyduke. ""I can guess who you are, my friend; you are one of the breed of those under my charge. So just wait while I summon our men.""

Taras realised his indiscretion, but vexation and obstinacy hindered him from devising a means of remedying it. Fortunately Yankel managed to interpose at this moment:—

""Most noble lord, how is it possible that the count can be a Cossack? If he were a Cossack, where could have he obtained such a dress, and such a count-like mien?""

""Explain that yourself."" And the heyduke opened his wide mouth to shout.

""Your royal highness, silence, silence, for heaven's sake!"" cried Yankel. ""Silence! we will pay you for it in a way you never dreamed of: we will give you two golden ducats.""

""Oho! two ducats! I can't do anything with two ducats. I give my barber two ducats for only shaving the half of my beard. Give me a hundred ducats, Jew."" Here the heyduke twirled his upper moustache. ""If you don't, I will shout at once.""

""Why so much?"" said the Jew, sadly, turning pale, and undoing his leather purse; but it was lucky that he had no more in it, and that the heyduke could not count over a hundred.

""My lord, my lord, let us depart quickly! Look at the evil-minded fellow!"" said Yankel to Taras, perceiving that the heyduke was turning the money over in his hand as though regretting that he had not demanded more.

""What do you mean, you devil of a heyduke?"" said Bulba. ""What do you mean by taking our money and not letting us see the Cossacks? No, you must let us see them. Since you have taken the money, you have no right to refuse.""

""Go, go to the devil! If you won't, I'll give the alarm this moment. Take yourselves off quickly, I say!""

""My lord, my lord, let us go! in God's name let us go! Curse him! May he dream such things that he will have to spit,"" cried poor Yankel.

Bulba turned slowly, with drooping head, and retraced his steps, followed by the complaints of Yankel who was sorrowing at the thought of the wasted ducats.

""Why be angry? Let the dog curse. That race cannot help cursing. Oh, woe is me, what luck God sends to some people! A hundred ducats merely for driving us off! And our brother: they have torn off his ear-locks, and they made wounds on his face that you cannot bear to look at, and yet no one will give him a hundred gold pieces. O heavens! Merciful God!""

But this failure made a much deeper impression on Bulba, expressed by a devouring flame in his eyes.

""Let us go,"" he said, suddenly, as if arousing himself; ""let us go to the square. I want to see how they will torture him.""

""Oh, my lord! why go? That will do us no good now.""

""Let us go,"" said Bulba, obstinately; and the Jew followed him, sighing like a nurse.

The square on which the execution was to take place was not hard to find: for the people were thronging thither from all quarters. In that savage age such a thing constituted one of the most noteworthy spectacles, not only for the common people, but among the higher classes. A number of the most pious old men, a throng of young girls, and the most cowardly women, who dreamed the whole night afterwards of their bloody corpses, and shrieked as loudly in their sleep as a drunken hussar, missed, nevertheless, no opportunity of gratifying their curiosity. ""Ah, what tortures!"" many of them would cry, hysterically, covering their eyes and turning away; but they stood their ground for a good while, all the same. Many a one, with gaping mouth and outstretched hands, would have liked to jump upon other folk's heads, to get a better view. Above the crowd towered a bulky butcher, admiring the whole process with the air of a connoisseur, and exchanging brief remarks with a gunsmith, whom he addressed as ""Gossip,"" because he got drunk in the same alehouse with him on holidays. Some entered into warm discussions, others even laid wagers. But the majority were of the species who, all the world over, look on at the world and at everything that goes on in it and merely scratch their noses. In the front ranks, close to the bearded civic-guards, stood a young noble, in warlike array, who had certainly put his whole wardrobe on his back, leaving only his torn shirt and old shoes at his quarters. Two chains, one above the other, hung around his neck. He stood beside his mistress, Usisya, and glanced about incessantly to see that no one soiled her silk gown. He explained everything to her so perfectly that no one could have added a word. ""All these people whom you see, my dear Usisya,"" he said, ""have come to see the criminals executed; and that man, my love, yonder, holding the axe and other instruments in his hands, is the executioner, who will despatch them. When he begins to break them on the wheel, and torture them in other ways, the criminals will still be alive; but when he cuts off their heads, then, my love, they will die at once. Before that, they will cry and move; but as soon as their heads are cut off, it will be impossible for them to cry, or to eat or drink, because, my dear, they will no longer have any head."" Usisya listened to all this with terror and curiosity.

The upper stories of the houses were filled with people. From the windows in the roof peered strange faces with beards and something resembling caps. Upon the balconies, beneath shady awnings, sat the aristocracy. The hands of smiling young ladies, brilliant as white sugar, rested on the railings. Portly nobles looked on with dignity. Servants in rich garb, with flowing sleeves, handed round various refreshments. Sometimes a black-eyed young rogue would take her cake or fruit and fling it among the crowd with her own noble little hand. The crowd of hungry gentles held up their caps to receive it; and some tall noble, whose head rose amid the throng, with his faded red jacket and discoloured gold braid, and who was the first to catch it with the aid of his long arms, would kiss his booty, press it to his heart, and finally put it in his mouth. The hawk, suspended beneath the balcony in a golden cage, was also a spectator; with beak inclined to one side, and with one foot raised, he, too, watched the people attentively. But suddenly a murmur ran through the crowd, and a rumour spread, ""They are coming! they are coming! the Cossacks!""

They were bare-headed, with their long locks floating in the air. Their beards had grown, and their once handsome garments were worn out, and hung about them in tatters. They walked neither timidly nor surlily, but with a certain pride, neither looking at nor bowing to the people. At the head of all came Ostap.

What were old Taras's feelings when thus he beheld his Ostap? What filled his heart then? He gazed at him from amid the crowd, and lost not a single movement of his. They reached the place of execution. Ostap stopped. He was to be the first to drink the bitter cup. He glanced at his comrades, raised his hand, and said in a loud voice: ""God grant that none of the heretics who stand here may hear, the unclean dogs, how Christians suffer! Let none of us utter a single word."" After this he ascended the scaffold.

""Well done, son! well done!"" said Bulba, softly, and bent his grey head.

The executioner tore off his old rags; they fastened his hands and feet in stocks prepared expressly, and—We will not pain the reader with a picture of the hellish tortures which would make his hair rise upright on his head. They were the outcome of that coarse, wild age, when men still led a life of warfare which hardened their souls until no sense of humanity was left in them. In vain did some, not many, in that age make a stand against such terrible measures. In vain did the king and many nobles, enlightened in mind and spirit, demonstrate that such severity of punishment could but fan the flame of vengeance in the Cossack nation. But the power of the king, and the opinion of the wise, was as nothing before the savage will of the magnates of the kingdom, who, by their thoughtlessness and unconquerable lack of all far-sighted policy, their childish self-love and miserable pride, converted the Diet into the mockery of a government. Ostap endured the torture like a giant. Not a cry, not a groan, was heard. Even when they began to break the bones in his hands and feet, when, amid the death-like stillness of the crowd, the horrible cracking was audible to the most distant spectators; when even his tormentors turned aside their eyes, nothing like a groan escaped his lips, nor did his face quiver. Taras stood in the crowd with bowed head; and, raising his eyes proudly at that moment, he said, approvingly, ""Well done, boy! well done!""

But when they took him to the last deadly tortures, it seemed as though his strength were failing. He cast his eyes around.

O God! all strangers, all unknown faces! If only some of his relatives had been present at his death! He would not have cared to hear the sobs and anguish of his poor, weak mother, nor the unreasoning cries of a wife, tearing her hair and beating her white breast; but he would have liked to see a strong man who might refresh him with a word of wisdom, and cheer his end. And his strength failed him, and he cried in the weakness of his soul, ""Father! where are you? do you hear?""

""I hear!"" rang through the universal silence, and those thousands of people shuddered in concert. A detachment of cavalry hastened to search through the throng of people. Yankel turned pale as death, and when the horsemen had got within a short distance of him, turned round in terror to look for Taras; but Taras was no longer beside him; every trace of him was lost."

[Verse 2]
I hate the things I think about you when I'm all alone
I know you're tough but I've been gone for so long
I play the memories of you inside my head
So all those pictures of us burn and radiate

Watch the clouds and I'm falling, falling through the cracks
Head beats and the heart is pounding fast
Off the ground into the starry dark
Into your arms I'm falling
I'm falling, I'm falling

[Chorus]
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they're calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right

[Bridge]
My brain, my body's fried
I've got to stay alive
I've got to take a chance and keep on moving
Keep on moving

[Chorus]
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
Don't know why they're calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's on my side and I know I'm right
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's on my side and I know I'm alright

Sixteen SaltinesJack White,"She's got stickers on her locker
And the boy's number's there in magic marker
I'm hungry and the hunger will linger
I eat sixteen saltine crackers then I lick my fingers

Well, every morning I deliver the news
Black hat, white shoes and I'm red all over
She's got a pink mailbox that she puts out front
Garbage in, garbage out; she's gettin' what she wants

Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
If I get busy then I couldn't care less what you do
But when I'm by myself, I think of nothing else
Than if a boy just might be gettin' through and touchin' you

Spike heels make a hole in a lifeboat
Driftin' away when I'm talkin' and laughin' as we float
I hear her whistle, that's how I know she's home
Lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home

Force fed forced meds till I drop dead
You can't defeat her, when you meet her you'll get what I said
The Lord knows there's a method to her madness
But the Lord's joke is a boat in a sea of sadness

She doesn't know but when she's gone
I sit and drink her perfume
And I'm sure she's drinkin' too
But why, where, and what for, and whom?
And I'm solo rowin' on one side of the boat
Lookin' out, throwin' up, a lifesaver down my throat

Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?"
AfterlifeSwitchfoot,"[Verse 1]
I’ve tasted fire I’m ready to come alive
I can’t just shut it up and fake that I’m alright
I’m ready now
I’m not waiting for the afterlife

Let it burn the way the sunlight burns my skin
The way I feel inside, the way the day begins
I’m ready now
I’m not waiting for the other side
I’m ready now
I’m ready now

The world is made
A chance to change
But I feel the same

And I wonder why
Would I wait till I die
To come alive?
I’m ready now
I’m not waiting for the afterlife

I still believe we could live forever
You and I we begin forever now
Forever now

I still believe in us together
You and I we’re here together now
Forever now

My feet are still sore my back is on the fringes
We tore up the walls we slept on couches
We lifted this house we lifted this house
Fire-crackers in the east my car parked south
Your hands on my cheeks your shoulder in my mouth
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town we rattle this scene

Fumbling around the back
Not one seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all a wash

Racing down the hill
I am faster than you

UnityShinedown,"[Verse 1]
I found a note with your name
And a picture of us
Even though it was framed
And covered in dust
It’s the map in my mind that sends me on my way

They say it’s never too late
To stop being afraid
And there is no one else here
So why should I wait?
And in the blink of an eye the past begins to fade

So have you ever been caught in a sea of despair?
And your moment of truth
Is the day that you say “I’m not scared”

[Chorus]
Put your hands in the air
If you hear me out there
I’ve been looking for you day and night
Shine a light in the dark
Let me see where you are
‘Cause I’m not gonna leave you behind

If I told you that you’re not alone
And I show you this is where you belong
Put your hands in the air
One more time

[Verse 2]
I’ve seen a million miles
Met a million faces
Took all I knew
To reach all these places
And I’d do it again
If it brings me back to you

So have you ever been caught in a sea of despair?
And your moment of truth
Is the day that you say “I’m not scared”

Put your hands in the air
If you hear me out there
I’ve been looking for you day and night
Shine a light in the dark

All the journeys of this great adventure
It didn't always feel that way
I wouldn't trade them because I made them
The best I could, and that's enough to say

I wish that I could live it all again
Some nights were bright

I wish that I could live it all again

Steer the airship right across the stars
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel

Youth Without YouthMetric,"[Verse 1]

Rubber soul with a razor blade
Behind the church, hiding place
It was a long joke 'til the punch line came
Can you read my mind?
Read my mind
Follow along to the end of the song

Hangman, we played
Double dutch with a hand grenade
Behind the church, hiding place
Apathetic to the Devil's face
Wear the sheriff's badge, put your toys away
They let us go saying, ""Let us pray!""

Hide and seek on the fire escape

One... two...
One... two... three... Go!

She's The WomanVan Halen,"A little low on cash
But I'm high on luck
I wanna be your knight in shining pick-up truck

With a Chevy for my summer home
Let's get the party started
It's looking like the city towed my other apartment

She got a doorbell sign that said:
""Bring it or don't ring it.""

She's the woman (Go on!)
She's the woman
She's the woman

Fate is my pimp
But she was cool
Said ""If you're doin' business with me, honey
What does that make you?
Some Casablanca gin joint?""
You're a nervous wreck

Your I.Q. plummets fourteen points
Her thunder thong around your neck
The song ain't dirty
It's really just the way we sing it. (Sing it!)

She's the woman (Sing it!)

Tomorrow morning
This suburban garage-a-trois
Was worth exploring

Yeah dreams come true
But it remains to be seen
By the time mine usually do
It's no longer me!

This Time It's DifferentEvans Blue,"Let GO!
This time it's different

I'm burning up
I'm filling up, see
Forever plagued with this fire inside me
Deliver all, to live or die blindly
It's empty it's bluffing defining the nothing
Interfering with the call of fate is crawling out of you and now
Finding comfort in the smallest spaces have sold out
I know I said
I hope I don't upset the light you defend
But this time it's different

Destroy my pain
Then capture life again
(This time it's different)
Destroy my shame
Can't live my life this way
LET! go, GO! let go
And capture life again
LET! go, GO! let go
Can't live my life this way

I'm giving up
I'm living but weak
I'm hearing voices from shadows inside me
I never sleep
My eyes are too focused, too hopeless, too broken, too open, to notice
Interfering with the call of fate is crawling out of you, and now
Finding comfort in the smallest spaces have sold out
I know I said
I hope I don't upset the light you defend
But this time it's different

Destroy my pain
Then capture life again

Destroy my shame
Can't live my life this way

Lost In Forever (Scream)P.O.D.,"Am I just floating around in this moment of time and space?
It makes me wonder
A state of mind 'cause I'm just fading away
And my head is lost up in the satellites
I'm so far and gone to ever get it right
Through unseeing eyes, day dreaming again
Eternity is seemingly an endless waiting
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time
It's never ending
I'm lost in forever
Am I just hanging around all alone in my mindless haze?
It takes me under
The infinite confined ready to blow you away
I'm too blind to see beyond the dead of night
But my spirit groans to see the after life
I'm so broken and small, come here and take me away
Eternity is seemingly an endless waiting
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time
It's never ending
I'm lost in forever
We live and we die given to faith and fear
When my time is over, where do I go from here?
Where do I go from here?

Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time
It's never ending
We're lost in forever

You can almost taste it
Never knowing which way to go, it's not been tested

All alone you try to take it, to fake it
And is the road less traveled taken, or forsaken

Now it's up to you, the path that you choose
Gotta do something different now
It's all the same, no one to blame
Gotta do something different now

So you head down the road that you chose
Just keep pushing forward
And the window is trying to close, just to shut you out

And all alone you try to take it, to fake it
And is the road less traveled taken, or forsaken

Now it's up to you, the path that you choose
Gotta do something different now

All that's left of us left of us
And only a few ever worried

While the signs were clear, they had no idea
You just get use to livin' in fear
Or give up, when you can't even picture your future

We walk the plank, with our eyes wide open

[Chorus: Call and (response)]
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we)
Yeah we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we)

[Verse 2]
And some people offered up answers
We made out we like we heard
They were only words
They didn't add up, to a change in the way we were living (it)
And the saddest thing, is all of it could've been avoided

But it was like to stop consuming's to stop being human
And why'd I make a change if you won't
We're all in the same, boat, stayin' afloat for the moment moment moment

[Chorus]
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we)
Yeah we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide, we
We walk the plank with our eyes wide, we
We walk the plank with our eyes wide, we
Mmmm hmmm mmm

[Hook]
(With our eyes wide open)
We, walk the plank, we walk the plank
(With our eyes wide open)
We, walk the plank, we walk the plank, we walk the plank
(With our eyes wide open)
We, walk the plank, we walk the plank
(With our eyes wide open)
And that is the end of the story"
AmericaDeuce,"[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Verse 1]
You can't tell me what to say 'cause I've got one religion
And I've got one decision, it's a big ""fuck you""
I keep spitting in your face, every month and every day
Every time you hear my name, my middle finger's up too
You think I owe you, but I ain't got no room for these hoes
'Cause they're no good, I ain't living by your rules
You're getting old, dude, full of liquor, you're bloated
And you wanna be noticed, but you're dying so slowly

[Pre-Chorus]
So when they point the finger, you flip one back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""
So when they point their finger, we'll flip ours back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""

They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame

Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Verse 2]
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, each one of you's gonna know
That your time is coming soon 'cause there ain't enough room
In this world for us too, yeah, I hate to break the news
But I'mma break it in this music and let the world know who
Who you've been using, who you're abusing, it's this youth that you're fooling
But you know that you're useless, always acting so ruthless
Deep inside you're just ruined 'cause I keep on moving, here to show you the truth, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
So when they point the finger, you flip one back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""
So when they point their finger, we'll flip ours back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""

[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Bridge]
Why can't you die?
Motherfucker, just die
No more goodbyes
Just fucking die

[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

Have you seen my hands?
Just look at 'em shake
And the song just keeps on repeating
Drop the needle again
And I dance with your ghost
Oh but that ain't the way
I can't move on and I can't stay the same
And all my friends say

Turn the record over

I'll see you on the flip side
There you go
Turn the key and engine over
Let her go
Let somebody else lay at her feet

But have you seen my heart?
Have you seen how it bleeds?
And the nights are so long baby
Out here in the deep
The tick, ticking of hours lonely
I hear the alarm
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms
But Better Sense says

There you go
Turn the key and engine over

Wait For MeRise Against,"[Verse 1]
Do you see the world in different colors?
Do you see the world in black and gray?
Alone in your thoughts, how many others
Have stood where you stand, where you stand today
I've stood where you stand, but oh can you...

[Chorus]
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now

[Verse 2]
The promise of safe return I delivered
But the ocean is wider than I first guessed
When roads disappeared I followed the rivers
But somehow got in over my head
So a deep breath I'm taking

[Chorus]
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now

[Verse 3]
A lost dream of what could have been
A house on fire, a tangled web
The key turns to find the locks have changed
In time to hear the back door slam
A sound that to this day I can't forget
The colors drained to black and gray
Oh...

[Chorus]
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now"
Kill Your HeroesAWOLNATION,"[Verse 1]
Well, I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
""Never let your fear decide your fate""

[Chorus]
I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun one day will leave us all behind
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Well, I hate to be the one to ruin the night
Right before your, right before your eyes

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause

Jump Into The FogThe Wombats,"[Verse 1]
What a great achievement it was
To get a hotel room this late
I'll bet they charge by the hour here
The kind of place you should bring your own UV ray

It's not a big problem with me, love
You don't look that hygienic, anyway
I'm only here because
I wanna twist the structure of my average day

[Chorus 1]
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your bones that shatter, not mine

We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog...

[Verse 2]
What a great achievement it was
To find someone who shirks such little self-restraint
I'm a non-believer, but
I believe in these dirty little wicked games

Snakes and ladders are banned in here, love
The climb's too rough just to slide back down again
I'm only here because
I feel the day deserves a truly sordid end

[Chorus 2]
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your brains that splatter, not mine

We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog...

[Bridge]
I've made some bad decisions; I'll admit that freely
It's just that life tastes sweeter when it's wrapped in debauchery
So drop your map, drop your plans, drop that five-step program
Because there's not an ounce of faith in this leap

It's clear you feel nothing, so jump into the fog with me!
(Jump in, jump in, jump in)…

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!"

RunawaysThe Killers,"[Verse 1]
Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

[Verse 2]
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We can't wait til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

[Verse 3]
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other till the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

[Verse 4]
At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We can't wait till tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

[Outro]
Oh! Oh! Oh!

Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeah, runaways

I know you can see
All the world and the mess that we're making
Can't give up
And hope God will intercede
Come on back
Imagine that
We could get it together
Stand up
For what we need to be
Because crying won't save or feed a hungry child
Can't lay down and
Wait for a miracle to change things
So, lift up your eyes, lift up your heart

Just want to be free yeah yeah
But you see
All the world is just as we have made it
And until we've got a new world
I got to say that
Love is not a whisper or a weakness
No, love is strong
Now we got to get it together, yeah
Got to get, got to get, got to get
Until there is no reason

ComebackRedlight King,"Many times I've walked the line
I've rolled the dice and questioned my life
Many times I sacrificed
And dealt with the pain

I've been down this road before
Where the dead ends are
It rains and it pours
I've been down below and
It's the price that I pay

I know how it feels
When you have to start again
Now there's no one to save me
I know how it feels
When the world is gonna end
But they'll see

Look into my eyes, you'll see
A graveyard filled with dirt and defeat
Look into my eyes you'll see
The weight on my soul

Where the fallen angels sleep
The crooked hearts and the crossroads meet
Where the haters say my name
And carve it in stone

I know how it feels
When I haven't got a friend
Even when they're standin' beside me
I know how it feels
When the world is gonna end
But they'll see

Here And NowSeether,"This fear has me chilled
Down to the bone
And I have been haunted by
These things I still have left to say

I'm weary of fighting this alone
So tired of holding on to
Strings much better left to fray

[Chorus]
And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this
Seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth

I'm wilted and faded after all
Too strung out and burnt out to be
Half the man that I could be

I'll never belong inside your world
So black out the sun and leave me
To play out the same old tragedy

[Chorus]
And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out and this
Seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this
Seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth

You're my savior after all
Use your flame to guide me home
And then lay your hand on me

And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this
Seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth
Hear me now here and now I'm calling

I miss the lies and the pain
The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake
I'm tellin' you!

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault

And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

I've tried but I just can't take it

And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Touch my own skin

And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Post-Chorus]
Home, home
Home, home

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Post-Chorus]
Home, home
Home, home"
SoldiersOtherwise,"[Verse 1]
It's time to strap our boots on
This is a perfect day to die
Wipe the blood out of our eyes
In this life, there's no surrender
There's nothing left for us to do
Find the strength to see this through

I'm going to kick you off the throne hang your crown up on the wall

Queen Of CaliforniaJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame

I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Verse 2]
Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Electric country blues guitar bridge]

[Verse 3]
If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote ""Blue"" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

SatisfiedAranda,"I, no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied

If the sun came up tomorrow
And you lived in the perfect place
That just wouldn’t be good enough for you
You could have a happy family
Money and the perfect face
But that wouldn’t be good enough for you
Enough for you

I, no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied
On a Sunday morning
Now I’m movin’ on
I, no I never wanna see you die
But I never wanna see you satisfied
Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied how it came and went
Satisfied when I pay your rent
Will you ever regret all the things you've said?
Satisfied

I crashed and burned a thousand times
Just to be your friend
But you gave me nothing in return
You played on my obsession for you
Until the bitter end
I can’t believe I got what you deserved
What you deserve.......

I, no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied
Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied how it came and went
Satisfied when I pay your rent
Will you ever regret all the things you said?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied in another man’s bed?
Satisfied you left me all but dead
How dare you ever deny all the things I did
Satisfied

I, no I never want to see you die
But I never want to see you satisfied"
Standing In The SunSlash,"[Verse 1]
You're the dark to light
You're never satisfied
You only know the things that will fail to be
A pessimistic one
Who sees the end to come
Where every joy is lost to a tragedy
And still, you wonder why you cannot find your peace today
Because you were meant to live
So much more than this
Now if only you could see

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still, the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
There ain't a cloud in sight
Still, your heart beats cold and grey
Every day

[Verse 2]
You know it brings me down
The way you drag around
Your heavy heart just like a stone
Well, keep your misery
Don't put it all on me
Cause I've got problems of my own

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still, the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
So keep your cloud of darkness and doom off my parade
Yeah today

[Verse 3]
And if I could, you know I'd set off a spark
I would burn it out, I would burn it all away
If you're a fire jaded, cold calloused heart
Some day, I'll find a way

[Solo]

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still, the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
So keep your cloud of darkness and doom off my parade
Yeah today

[Outro]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still, the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
Someday I'll steal the spark, I will burn your doubt away
I'll find a way"
That Wasn't MeBrandi Carlile,"Hang on, just hang on for a minute
I've got something to say
I'm not asking you to move on or forget it
But these are better days
To be wrong all along and admit it, is not amazing grace
But to be loved like a song you remember
Even when you've changed

Tell me, did I go on a tangent?
Did I lie through my teeth?
Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?
Did I bring shame on my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
Whatever you've seen, that wasn't me
That wasn't me, oh that wasn't me

When you're lost you will toss every lucky coin you'll ever trust
And you'll hide from your God like he ever turns his back on us
And you will fall all the way to the bottom and land on your own knife
And you'll learn who you are even if it doesn't take your life

Tell me, did I go on a tangent?
Did I lie through my teeth?
Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?
Did I bring shame on my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
Whatever you've seen, that wasn't me
That wasn't me, oh that wasn't me

But I want you to know that you'll never be alone
I wanna believe, do I make myself a blessing to everyone I meet
When you fall I will get you on your feet
Do I spend time with my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
When that's what you've seen, that will be me
That will be me, that will be me
That will be me"
Top Of The WorldSlightly Stoopid,"[Verse 1: Miles]
So, when the music's stoppin'
There's no more knockin' or kickin down my door
Ain't no need for changin' or rearranging
The life we have endured
All these foolish ways, with these hopeless strays
Keep you comin' back for more
By the time you hear it, it's over, it's over
I really must have lost my mind
Wasn't me who wasn't hard to find
Six strings on my back, always lookin' for the next track
Thinkin' 'bout the old 'hood, always up to no good
When you gonna realize
That we livin' like we hypnotized?
By the sound that you hear when the music's over
Times runnin' out, can't you see it's for ya?

[Chorus: Kyle]
When you're down and out
Nobody open their mouth
No-one ever come around your way
When you're on top of the world
Every man and every girl wanna come and get some shit for free
When you're sittin' on the corner
No one's ever gonna pay you any mind, that day
You're just sittin' outside, gettin' colder

[Verse 2: Kyle]
Not long ago, when you wasn't that old
Now, look at you is old and gray
Like a piece of your mind that was stolen in time
Never listen what nobody says
The reason everyday is not a holiday
Because, the government, they steal your pay
Was a dream, but it's already over
Won't someone get us out of here?
I'm alive but I can't feel
Cannot tell what's reality
Cannot tell what is and isn't real

[Chorus]"
We Come RunningYoungblood Hawke,"[Intro]
When come running
We come running
We come running
We come running

[Verse 1]
Under a pale blue sky
You never felt so cold
Another sleepless night
How could you ever let go?
How do you recognize
The dirty face of gold
Behind that crooked line
Where you never knew you'd go

[Chorus]
Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gonna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

[Verse 2]
When the worlds gone quiet (whoa)
I see you dancing slow (whoa)
Feeling satisfied
Where you never knew you'd go

Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gonna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

Days go by
Feeling broke and tired
Remember
Always remember
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

HeadlightsMorning Parade,"[Verse 1]
Late Like the evening sun, I
I sink to the ground
I'll keep my promises, I
I won't let you down

[Chorus]
'Cause like a rabbit in your headlights
I am the beckon to your call
And like the early morning headlines
I am all too predictable
Yeah, I'm all too predictable

(Oh oh oh-oh)

You're steady as I come undone, you
You're quietly bound
But I'll keep my promises, I
I won't let you down

True like the first-born
Weighed pound for pound
I'll keep my promises like
A thorn in your crown

I am the beckon to your call

'Cause I'm all too predictable
Yeah I'm all to predictable"
Like I RollBlack Stone Cherry,"I got my daddy’s car
And his old guitar
A suitcase full of broken hearts
Got my momma’s smile
And her baby blue eyes
I ain’t got much
But what I got is mine
And I roll like I roll
I roll like I roll

I got an open road
And a restless soul
The Rolling Stones on the radio
And I roll like I roll
Cause’ I roll like I roll

I roll like the hills under the California sun
Burn through the desert like the devil on the run
I’ll be flying high till the day that I die
No matter what they say
I begin another day
I will roll like I roll

Well there’s a lot a people gonna try to bring you down
They got a lot of rules
They gonna try to put you out
I keep looking up
In this world full of doubt
I roll like I roll

I roll like the hills under the California sun
Burn through the desert like a devil on the run
I’ll be flying high till the day that I die
No matter what they say
I begin another day

I’m not gonna let it slip away
Cause I’d rather burn in hell
Than to let it fade

I got an open road
And a restless soul
The Rolling Stones on the radio
And I roll like I roll

I roll through the hills by my own Kentucky home
Back to the place where my heart belongs
I’ll be flying high till the day that I die
No matter what they say
I begin another day
I did it my way"
Holland RoadMumford,"So I was lost, go count the cost
Before you go to the Holland Road
With your heart like a stone you spared no time in lashing out
And I knew your pain and the effect of my shame
But you cut me down, you cut me down

And I will not tell the thoughts of hell
That carried me home from the Holland Road
With my heart like a stone and I put up no fight
To your calloused mind, and from your corner you rose
To cut me down, you cut me down

So I hit my low, but little did I know
That would not be the end
From the Holland Road
Well I rose and I rose and I paid less time
To your calloused mind, and I wished you well
As you cut me down, you cut me down

But I still believe though these cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you believe in me I'll still believe

But I still believe though these cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you believe in me I'll still believe"
Ghosts That We KnewMumford,"Lyrics in the main body of text are for the UK version
Lyrics in (brackets) are for the US version
The US version is somewhat longer and has slightly different lyrics

[Verse 1]
You saw my pain, washed out in the rain
And broken glass saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside my hope torn apart
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Verse 2]
So lead me back
Turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Bridge]
But hold me still
Bury my heart on the coals (next to yours)
And hold me still
Bury my heart next to yours (on the coals)

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold with all of my might (as long as you like)

Lover's EyesMumford,"Well love was kind
For a time
Now just aches
And it makes me blind
This mirror holds
My eyes too bright
I can't see
The others in my life

Were we too young
Our heads too strong
To bear the weight
Of these lovers' eyes
Cause I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse
Of these lovers' eyes

[Hook]
But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes

Cause there's no drink
Or drug I've tried
To rid the curse of
These lovers' eyes
And I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Your strength just makes me feel less strong

[Hook]
But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes

And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way

And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way

Hopeless WandererMumford,"You heard my voice
I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name

So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start

[Hook]
So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer

I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine

So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

[Hook]
So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
The skies I'm under"
Lost In The EchoLinkin Park,"[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go

Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see

That I could never be held
Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell

There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?

I've seen that, frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back, unshaken
Let down and lived and let go

So, you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone

I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go!

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how

I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go
Go, go, go, go"
Below My FeetMumford,"You were cold
As the blood through your bones
And the light which led us from our chosen homes
Well I was lost

And now I sleep
Sleep the hours that I can't weep
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
I was lost

[Hook]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

And I was still
But I was under your spell
When I was told by Jesus all was well
For all must be well

Just give me time
You know your desires and mine
Wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well

[Hook x2]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn"
ReminderMumford,"Don't let me darken your door
That's not what I came here for
No it's not what I came here for

And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
I won't know if I'm doing you wrong
I never know if I'm doing you wrong

[Hook]
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
It's all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
But my love don't fade away

So watch the world tear us apart
A stoic mind and bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart

And your lights always shining on
And I been traveling oh so long
I been traveling oh so long

[Hook]
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
It's all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
But my love don't' fade away

Oh my love don't fade away"
Broken CrownMumford,"Touch my mouth and hold my tongue
I’ll never be your chosen one
I’ll be home, safe and tucked away
You can’t tempt me if I don’t see the day
The pull on my flesh was just too strong
Stifles the choice and the air in my lungs
Better not to breathe than to breathe a lie
Cause when I open my body I breathe a lie
I will not speak of your sin
There was a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shot
And oh, my heart was flawed I knew my weakness
So hold my hand, consign me not to darkness

So crawl on my belly ‘til the sun goes down
I’ll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace

So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace

So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I can take the road and I can fuck it all away
But in this twilight, our choices seal our fate"
Not With HasteMumford,"[Verse 1]
Your eyes they tie
Me down so hard
I'll never learn to put up a guard
So keep my love
My candle bright
Learn me hard, oh learn me right
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
Though I may speak
Some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength
From which to speak
When you sit me down, and see I'm weak

[Hook]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

[Verse 2]
So as we walked
Through fields of green
Was the fairest sun I'd ever seen
And I was broke
I was on my knees
But you said yes as I said please
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
I leave no ties
For a cynics mind

[Hook]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

[Verse 3]
Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste
As it keeps my heart and soul in it's place
And I will love with urgency but not with haste"
Where Are You NowMumford,"[Verse 1]
We came to the end it seems you had heard
As we walked the city streets you never said a word
When we finally sat down your eyes were full of spite
I was desperate, I was weak, I could not put up a fight

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

[Verse 2]
You were strangely less in pain than you were cold
Triumphant in your mind of the logic that you hold
You said no one would ever know the love that we had shared
As I took my leave to go it was clear you didn't care

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

[Verse 3]
And I hear of your coming and your going in the town
I hear stories of your smile, I hear stories of your frown
And the darkness can descend we can relish all the pain
But I know that's what you love cause you know I love the same

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?"
AngelsThe xx,"[Verse 1]
Light reflects from your shadow
It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room
Like breathing was easy
If someone believed me

[Chorus]
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
In love, love, love

[Verse 2]
And everyday
I am learning about you
The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels
And leaving without them
And leaving without them

[Chorus]
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 3]
And with words unspoken
A silent devotion
I know you know what I mean
And the end is unknown
But I think I'm ready
As long as you're with me

[Chorus]
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love, love, love"
For Those BelowMumford,"Helpless she lies across the stairs
Haunting your days, consuming your prayers
There will be healing but don't force this girl to stand
As she's counting the ceilings with pale voice and trembling hands

[Chorus]
You told me life was long but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of a flock
Called to be a rock for those below

Whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
Hold your throat is that healing that you're hearing in her tune
Wanting change but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of a man who's built his life on love

[Chorus]

I'll be locked up and stored
In the lavender ward
Cause my mind is just like hers
Just as broken just as crippled just as burned

And then I find myself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be a rock for those below"
Doom And GloomThe Rolling Stones,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top

[Pre-Chorus]
What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

[Chorus]
When all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that light, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?

[Verse 2]
We lost all that treasure in an overseas war
Just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Bowing to the rich and you worry 'bout the poor
Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors

[Pre-Chorus]
What's that funky noise?
It's the tightening of their screws
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

[Chorus]
All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go
Boom, boom, boom
Through that night, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Yeah, baby, won't you dance with me?
Ah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking at the garbage dump
I'm running out of water, so I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober, but I end up drunk

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Gonna make your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt, yeah

[Chorus]
But all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that night, your face I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?

[Outro]
Yeah, come on
Baby won't you dance with me?
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Oh yeah, sitting in the dirt
Baby, won't you dance with me?"
My Oh MyTristan Prettyman,"[Verse 1]
You got my heart on a string
You want me back again and you know I’ll do anything
Just when I thought I was free
Knock, knock, the door is locked
But you still got a key
All too familiar, the moment it shows up
Now everything I know seems to fly

[Chorus]
My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again
Here you are standing there
Tell me why I should try-y-y
My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y

[Verse 2]
You got me under a spell
You look like heaven, oh, but you put me through hell
God knows there’s nothing to gain
Well who am I to deny, we’re both playing the same game
All too familiar, the moment it blows up
Now everything I know seems to fly

[Chorus]
My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again
Here you are standing there
Tell me why I should try-y-y
My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y

[Bridge]
And I know that you’re no good for me
And it makes no sense at all
Still I keep coming back for more
‘Cause I’m addicted to your call

I know you ain’t no good for me
And all the lies and the lines you fed to me
The way you kept coming back for me
Like the last breath left of the air I need

I know you ain’t no good for me
And all the lies and the lines you fed to me
The way you kept coming back for me
Like the last breath left of the air I need

[Chorus]
My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again
Here you are standing there
Tell me why I should try-y-y
My oh my-y-y

My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y

My oh my-y-y

I know you ain’t no good for me
And all the lies and the lines you fed to me"
Let Yourself GoGreen Day,"[Verse 1]
Shut your mouth cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a damn anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit
And all you really do is complain
It's your lie, tell it how you like
Small minds tend to think alike

Shut your mouth cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a fuck anyway

[Chorus]
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go

[Verse 2]
Cut the crap cause you're screaming in my ear
And you're taking up all of the space
You're really testing my patience again
And I'd rather get punched in the face
You're getting on my very last nerve
Everything you said I've already heard

I'm sick to death of your every last breath
And I don't give a fuck anyway (SHUT THE FUCK UP!)

[Chorus]
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go"
SupremacyMuse,"[Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
Wake to see - your true emancipation is a fantasy
Policies have risen up and overcome the brave
Greatness dies, unsung and lost, invisible to history
Embedded spies brainwashing our children to be mean

[Chorus]
You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy...
Your supremacy

You don't have long

BloodIn This Moment,"[Verse 1]
I hate you for the sacrifices you made for me
I hate you for every time you ever bled for me
I hate you for the way you smile when you look at me
I hate you for never taking control of me

I hate you for always saving me from myself
I hate you for always choosing me and not someone else
I hate you for always pulling me back from the edge
I hate you for every kind word you ever said
I'll bleed you dry now

Blood, blood, blood
Pump mud through my veins
Shut your dirty, dirty mouth
I'm not that easy

Pump mud through my veins

I love you for everything you ever took from me
I love the way you dominate and you violate me
I love you for every time you gave up on me
I love you for the way you look when you lie to me
I love you for never believing in what I say
I love you for never once giving me my way
I love you for never delivering me from pain
I love you for always driving me insane
I'll bleed you dry now

Pump mud through my veins
Shut your dirty, dirty mouth

[Verse 1]
I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you
Oh, what can I do? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You are runnin' wild, runnin' wild, it's true

[Verse 3]
Sick for days in so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh show me how to get right
Yeah, it's out of sight

[Verse 4]
When I was young and movin' fast
Nothin' slowed me down, oh, slowed me down
Now I let the others pass, I've come around
Oh come around, 'cause I've found

[Outro / Bridge]
Livin' just to keep goin'
Goin' just to be sane
All the while not knowin'
It's such a shame

I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel

Waiting For The EndLinkin Park,"[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
Holding on to what I haven't got
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear"
Shake Me DownCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now? Softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

[Verse 2]
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down

[Chorus 1]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

[Verse 3]
Shake me down, cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound, softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

[Verse 4]
In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down

[Chorus 2]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now, it's time for me to let go
Way down, had to find a place to lay low
Lamp shade, turned around into a light post

[Bridge]
Walk around the corner, never saw it coming, still
I try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief
I don't want to know the future, I'm like Rolling Thunder
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Say You'll Haunt MeStone Sour,"[Verse 1]
Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared

I was never good enough to find
I was never bad enough to mind
In the middle I will do my best
Take me in your arms and leave the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you anything to

Say you want to stay, you want me too
Say you'll never die, you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
Together, together, we'll be together, together forever

[Verse 2]
Little variations on my page
Little doors open on my cage
Little time has come and gone so far
Little by little who you are
I can see the patterns on your face
I can see the miracles I trace
Symmetry and shadows I can't hide
I just wanna be right by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you everything to

[Chorus 2]
Say you want to stay, you want me too
Say you'll never die, you'll always haunt me
I want to know I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me

Say you'll never die, you'll always haunt me

I want to know I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me

Use your voice every single time you open up your mouth

The AnimalDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
Nah-ah ,nah-ah
Now
I can feel the animal inside
My resolve is weakening
Pounding at the doors of my mind
It's nearly overpowering
I cannot begin to describe
The hunger that I feel again
Run if you intend to survive

[Bridge]
For the beast is coming to life
Taking form in the glimmer in this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

[Chorus 1]
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

[Verse 2]
I can hear it calling again
The primal need is filling me
Changes are about to begin
And now my blood is boiling
I can see the fear in your eyes
But you can't bring yourself to scream
Time to shed the mortal disguise

[Bridge]
For the beast is coming to life
Taking form in the glimmer in this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

[Chorus 2]
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

[Verse 3]
We begin the hunt and I
Feel the power course, as the creatures take flight
For the kill is close and I will be satisfied
For the smell of fear tonight
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied
You're mine

[Chorus 2]
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

[Chorus 3]
For the animal's soul is mine
And the world around will never hear your cries
An unholy crime
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight"

And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh
I want some more

What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more

What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Here we go again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh, oh
I want some more

What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more

What are you waiting for

Hush, hush the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight

Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again

I want some more

What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight

World So ColdThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd feel this
Guilty and I'm broken down inside
Living with myself, nothing but lies
I always thought I'd make it
But never knew I'd let it get so bad
Living with myself is all I have

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like I'm frozen in time

[Chorus]
Living in a world so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell with no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away

[Verse 2]
Do you ever feel me?
Do you ever look deep down inside
Staring at yourself, paralyzed

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like I'm frozen in time

Living in a world so cold
Wasting away

Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away from me

I'm too young (I'm too young)
To lose my soul
I'm too young (I'm too young)
To feel this old
So long (So long)
I'm left behind
I feel like I'm losing my mind

Do you ever feel me?
Do you ever look deep down inside
Staring at your life, paralyzed

Dog Days Are OverFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
Happiness hit her, like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[Bridge]
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

[Verse 2]
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back, back, back...
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[Outro]
The dog days are over
The dog days are gone
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
The dog days are over
The dog days are gone
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come"

Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?

Tremble for yourself, my man

Or else spend your days biting your own neck

Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection

Within a day you find yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now?

What's with the violent aggression?

When the roll is called up yonder
I hope you see me there

It's in the water, it's where you came from
When the crowd begins to wonder
And they cry to see your face

It's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
Your sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's going to shape her
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

So the roll it was called from yonder
Never sold yourself away

Help Is On The WayRise Against,"[Verse 1]
I have my mother's dreams, I have my father's eyes
You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try
The Crescent City sleeps, while giants in the sky
Preparing to unleash, let loose a mighty cry

Can nobody save us? Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning, the cypress has died
And all alone they're saying

[Hook]
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

Five thousand feet below, as black smoke engulfs the sky
The ocean floor explodes, eleven mothers cry
My bones all resonate a burning lullaby
You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try

She stands at the shoreline with hands in the air
Her words pierce the dark night, ""does anyone care?""
And all alone they're saying

[Hook]
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here

Choking on the black gold, upon which we rely
We keep axes in the attics to see cameras in the sky
""Help is on the way"" they said, they said
""Help is on the way"" they said, they said
We were told just to sit tight
Cause somebody will soon arrive
""Help is on the way""

But it never came
It never came

Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me

The CaveMumford,"[Verse 1]
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 2]
Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 3]
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

[Chorus]
And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

And I can't seem to find my way home

And it's almost like, your heaven's trying everything
Your heaven's trying everything to keep me out

All the places I've been and things I've seen
A million stories that made up a million shattered dreams
The faces of people I'll never see again
And I can't seem to find my way home

This never ending story
Paid for with pride and faith
We all fall short of glory
Lost in our fate

No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

I will never forget
I will never regret
I will live my life

I will never forget
I will never regret
I will live my life

[Chorus]
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge
(No, no, no, no)
Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge

Closer to the edge"
All American NightmareHinder,"Let's go!
Nightmare!
Rock!

[Verse 1]
Dressed head-to-toe
Black on black
Three bunnies in the back
Of my Cadillac

With me it's gonna be
A good story to tell
Cash, grass, and ass
On the highway to hell

Be careful what you wish for
When you dream

[Chorus]
I make the good girls bad
And bad girls worse
Nice guys are last
Cause I'm always first

I'm a freak-show sucker
For how it feels
Turn the girl next door
Into hell on heels

I'm red, white, blue, tattooed, and just don't care
I'm your all-american nightmare

[Verse 2]
If you want to run away
I can give you a ride
I'm a one-way ticket
To your darker side

Come with me
Baby, let's lose some sleep

Don't mistake me for a dream

[Chorus]
I make the good girls bad
And bad girls worse
Nice guys are last
Cause I'm always first

I'm a freak-show sucker
For how it feels
Turn the girl next door
Into hell on heels

I'm red, white, blue, tattooed, and just don't care
I'm your all-american nightmare

[Bridge]
They try to lock me up
And throw away the key
But they're never gonna hold down
A freak like me

I'm an outcast, smoking grass, living for speed
And I'll be anything you want
But nothing less than that

Stick to me baby

[Chorus]
I make the good girls bad
And bad girls worse
Nice guys are last
Cause I'm always first

I'm a freak-show sucker
For how it feels
Turn the girl next door
Into hell on heels

I'm red, white, blue, tattooed, and just don't care
I'm your all-american nightmare
I'm your all-american nightmare
I'm your all-american nightmare

Yeah

And I'll be nothing less than that

All I WantA Day To Remember,"[Verse 1]
I'm always screaming my lungs out 'til my head starts spinning
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
I'm constant like the seasons
And I will never be forgotten man

[Refrain]
Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

[Chorus]
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

[Verse 2]
Still got something left to prove
It tends to keep things movin' while everyone around me says
My last days are looming overhead
But just what the hell do they think they know?
I keep my head above the water, while they drown in the undertow

[Refrain]
Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

[Chorus]
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

[Bridge]
If you take it from me, live your life for yourself
Cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else
C'mon!

[Verse 3]
So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me was this all worth it?
I get what I want so everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

[Chorus]
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

[Outro]
Keep your heads down low, keep your heads down low
Keep your hopes up high, and your heads down low"

Any of these thoughts racin' through my brain, it's true

Machine Gun BluesSocial Distortion,"[Verse 1]
Well I'm a gangster in 1934
Junkies, winos, pimps, and whores
And all you men, women and kids
Best stay out of the way
I just left your town
Took all your loot
Wore a pink carnation and a pinstripe suit
A hopped up V8 Ford, and some two-tone shoes

[Chorus]
And I'm already gone
I left a pool of blood and sorrow
I've got the machine gun blues

[Verse 2]
I'll be out of here before the break of dawn
Hit the highway, smoke a big cigar
Gonna stop and bury the cash
Then get some more
There's only one thing on my mind
That's makin' across that ol' state line
Amid a hail of avenging bullets
That are meant for me

[Chorus]
And I'm already gone
I left a path of pure destruction
I've got the machine gun blues
Already gone
My life will soon be through
I've got the machine gun blues

[Bridge]
I'm public enemy number one
I'm sorry for all the things that I've done
If indeed we do cross paths
It's nothing personal

[Chorus]
And I'm already gone
I left a trail of devastation
I've got the machine gun blues
Already gone
My life will soon be through
I've got the machine gun blues"
Awake And AliveSkillet,"[Verse 1]
I'm at war with the world and they
Try to pull me into the dark
I struggle to find my faith
As I'm slipping from your arms
It's getting harder to stay awake
And my strength is fading fast
You breathe into me at last

[Chorus]
I'm awake I'm alive
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time
I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life
Here (right here), right now (right now)
I'll stand my ground and never back down
I know what I believe inside
I'm awake and I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I'm at war with the world 'cause I
Ain't never going to sell my soul
I've already made up my mind
No matter what I can't be bought or sold
When my faith is getting weak
And I feel like giving in
You breathe into me again

[Chorus]
I'm awake I'm alive
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time
I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life

In your arms I feel you breathe into me
Forever hold this heart that I will give to you
Forever I will live for you

I'm awake I'm alive
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time
I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life

1983Neon Trees,"[Verse 1]
I've been here looking dynamite
Alone against the wall
Girls like you give it all so cold
Talking cheap in a bathroom stall
And you look so smooth
You better tell me the truth
Would you trade me
Out for someone cool?
I know you better than you do
So put out your cigarette
And kiss me on
The lips tonight

I've got something that I've kept inside
And the blood is on the blade

Like you haven't aged a day
And it ain't so pretty when you're playing cute
When your body's up against some fool
Does he feel it?
Cause I feel it

HesitateStone Sour,"[Verse 1]
You - were my fire, so I burned
'Til there was nothing left of me
I - I touched your face, I held you close
'Til I could barely breathe
Why - give me hope, then give me up?
Just to be the death of me
Save the rest of me

[Chorus]
'Cause I see you, but I can't feel you anymore
So go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore
You hesitate

Now - now and then, you come around
Like there's something left for me
We were one, we were everything
I'm still here, but I'll just keep the rest of me

'Cause I see you, but I can't feel you anymore
So go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore

BurnPapa Roach,"[Verse 1]
I did not know you were a fake
Every lie straight to my face
So blind I could not see
Right behind my back you stabbed me
Should have know you were a bitch
Shut up you are making me sick
Little man you are nothing like me
Lying cheating so deceiving
I trusted you broke me down
And you screwed me over

Do not try to deny it
You cannot hide it

Looking over your shoulder fucking me over
I trusted you sold me out

Hold OnAll That Remains,"[Verse 1]
Don't touch me, I don't wanna feel your skin
I know that you're only gonna hurt me
I hear you, I don't wanna do it again
Cause we both know this is not a passing trait!

All along a failure to connect and to compromise
Right or wrong, it's easy to react
Time to realize

IssuesEscape The Fate,"[Verse 1]
This is the death of me
I feel it constantly
Just like an enemy
That wants to see me bleed

So I try to be silent, but my words, they explode like hand grenades
I just gotta stay calm, before I let this time bomb blow up in my face

When You're Young3 Doors Down,"[Verse 1]
So far away from knowing where I am going
I am trying hard to find out who I am
They all say that I don't know what I am doing
I say they don't hardly understand

[Hook]
Why can't they remember
What I'll never forget
How these dreams can come undone

You give what you give 'cause they make you
Trapped inside a place that won't take you

Everything's OK (everything's OK)

Turn So ColdDrowning Pool,"It's too much - Not enough
What you need - I don't get
I don't know why you never say - You never do

Is this my luck again?
Silent words never shed
All I get is you turning away

You turn so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
What you never go and say
You're so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
Never do - Never say

Is it me that you see
Changing what you think you need?
All I can say is
I'll always trade me for you
Is it my heart I break?
Hard to give what you won't take
If you did, would you throw it away?

And turn so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
What you never go and say
You're so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
Never do - Never say...
Our time is slipping away... Slipping away

Isn't my word enough?
What I say, is what you get
And all I get is you turning away

You turn so cold - It's never enough

What you never go and say
You're so cold - It's never enough

Hear Me NowHollywood Undead,"[Verse 1: J-Dog]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out of my chest
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find
But maybe I won't because I left it all behind
Now I'm stuck with this, and that'll never change
Always a part of me until the very last day
Where to go from here? What road to travel on?
I spent my whole life choosing, and it always chose wrong
Will I try to have the will to be alive?
Will I try 'cause I've never seen the light?
Lowered to the ground, and it's now you see
You spent your whole life taking the best of me

[Chorus: Danny]
Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
How long can I keep pretending to be
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me?
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees
A man of many words but a man of few deeds
Walking these streets so absent of hope
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home
Lend him a hand, then we're walking away
Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame
So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight
When you wake up, you know, it's darker than last night
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life

[Chorus: Danny]
Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now

[Bridge: Danny]
Look into my eyes and I see, what do I see?
Nothing at all
Take another look around me, what do I see?
Nothing at all

[Chorus: Danny]
Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now
Can you hear me, hear me now?"

And watch the world explode

Rolling In The DeepAdele,"[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (oh-oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa-oh)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (oh-oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"
FaderThe Temper Trap,"[Verse 1]
I'm in transit
Floating, stranded on this boat
And I pledge my self allegiance
To a better night's sleep at home
And the sweet, sweet sun's comin' down hard
The sun's comin' down hard, it burns the bones
So hold a hand for cover, hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm

Bless this mess
We tried our best, that's all that we can do
While the angels walk with the lonely ones
In the cold rain to rescue you
And this fable world's comin' down hard
The wall's comin' down hard on all our homes

Hold a hand for cover from harm

JusticeRev Theory,"I want justice I want you overthrown
I want justice
I want to stand alone

So take all you can from an open hand
The hope of the dying
To save your disease
You're an empty breed
Your love of this lifetime

So you're somebody who brags about their innocence
While playing on the ignorant storm
Now I'm just here to criticize the lies, the lies, the lies

I want justice I want you overthrown

I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head

So cry if you feel
That the tears you shed will make you feel better
See I'm just critical of living like a criminal
While you become a royalty hiding
I wonder how you'll justify the lies, the lies, the lies

I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head

So bury all the evidence
Disguise yourself plead innocent
One penalty, one consequence is sure
Your jury they will recognize the lies, the lies, the lies, the lies

I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage
I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head

I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want you dead

I want justice I want justice
Give me justice and I want you dead"

RunawayHail the Villain,"Welcome to the end
Of everything that haunts me
Somehow I pretend
All was meant to be
I am not the saint here
Never the good son
Hell has taken over and I know

When I say ""Go"", runaway, runaway

Where do I belong?
So sick of being shadows
Scared to walk alone
Now it's time to roam
I have always wanted
All that I could own
My wish was never granted till now"
The Ghost InsideBroken Bells,"[Verse 1]
She sold her love to a modern man
Good solid currency’s the hardest to land
All of that money helps you cover your ass
Don't let the ladyfinger blow in your hands

[Chorus]
Did it all, for that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Verse 2]
Just like a whiskey bottle drained on the floor
She got no future, just a life to endure
This good samaritan is shaking her hand
Too late to leave here now, the songs in the can

[Chorus]
Give it up, for that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Verse 3]
You call it chivalry
Never pull a punch for free
You ever wonder why they had to move on
This phony honor code
That put you on your throne
A double-standard you invoke when you want

[Chorus]
For that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Outro]
Was it all for show?
Don't turn into one of them
Turning another page
Trust me darling
I'm carving a moat through the dust in your town
Crawling over the rubble
Just to serve you
Tend to wonder why"
Louder Than EverCold War Kids,"[Verse 1]
All my windows were barred
The sun made stripes of shade
I was sitting 'round like a zombie
Feedin' my own face

[Verse 2]
I was carrying my cheek
I was digging my strange
I was taking you for granted
You were holding the reins

[Chorus]
But I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Now I can hear you louder than ever

[Verse 3]
It's a slippery slope
Like that mouse trap game
Inside my tunnel vision
You slept on my train

[Chorus]
But I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Now I can hear you louder than ever

[Bridge]
I don't want to ignore
You or the past or my feelings
We're probably gonna get out of this just
Hear me out anyway
The darkness snuck in
And now I'm doubtin' all my promises
Don't try to pull me out of this
Just lay down by me and wait

[Chorus]
'Cause I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Yeah I can hear you louder than ever

Now I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever"
We Used To WaitArcade Fire,"[Verse 1]
I used to write
I used to write letters
I used to sign my name
I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
But by the time we met
By the time we met
The times had already changed
So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart
I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was left standing in the wilderness downtown

[Hook]
Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

[Verse 2]
And it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive
We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown

[Bridge]
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooooo we used to wait
Still moving through the pain

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna write a letter to my true love
I'm gonna sign my name
Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again
Gonna move through the pain

[Hook]
Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

[Bridge]
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooooo we used to wait
Still moving through the pain
We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait

[Outro]
We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming
Sing the chorus again
We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming
Sing the chorus again
I used to wait for it
I used to wait for it
Hear my voice screaming
Sing the chorus again

Wait for it!
Wait for it!!
Wait for it!!!"
Born FreeKid Rock,"[Verse 1]
Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But, tell them if I don't survive

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 2]
Free, like a river raging
Strong as the wind I’m facing
Chasing dreams and racing father time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can’t see my heart you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can’t keep no chains on me

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 3]
And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Calm, facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Outro]
I will bow to the shining sea
And celebrate God's grace on thee"
Under Cover Of DarknessThe Strokes,"[Verse 1]
Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

[Chorus]
And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

[Chorus]
And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

[Chrous]
I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning, yelling ""no more!""
So long my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you"
PyroKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
Single book of matches, gonna burn what's standing in the way
Roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade
Bury all the pictures, and tell the kids that I'm okay
If I'm forgotten, they'll remember me for today

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on

[Verse 2]
All the black inside of me, is slowly seeping from the bone
Everything I cherish, is slowly dying or it's gone
Little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree
Once the show gets started it's bound to be a sight to see

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I

[Bridge]
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on (Watch her roll)
I (Can you feel it?)
I won't ever be your cornerstone
I (Watch her roll)"
Lost In YouThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
I always knew that you'd come back to get me
And you always knew that it wouldn't be easy
To go back to the start to see where it all began
Or end up at the bottom to watch how it all ends

[Pre-Chorus]
You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said I'm nothing without you
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you

[Verse 2]
You always thought that I left myself open
But you didn't know I was already broken
I told myself that it wouldn't be so bad
But pulling away you took everything I had

[Pre-Chorus]
You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said I'm nothing without you
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you, in you

[Bridge]
The pain of it all, the rise and the fall
I see it all in you
Now every day I find myself say
I want to get lost in you
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you (Somehow I found)

[Outro]
A way to get lost in you (A way to get lost in you)"
Down By The WaterThe Decemberists,"See this ancient riverbed
See where all the follies led
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag

I was just some tow-head teen
Feeling round for fingers to get in between
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag

The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag

Sweet descend this rabble round
The pretty little patter of a seaport town
Rolling in the water and
Rolling down the old main drag

All dolled up in gabardine
The lash-flashing Leda Of Pier Nineteen
Queen of the water and
Queen of the old main drag

The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag

The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag

Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag

Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag"
Country BoyAaron Lewis,"[Verse 1: Aaron Lewis]
Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said, ""You wanna sell a million records, boy? You better listen to me""

[Bridge: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
He said, ""Change your style, whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?""

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
I said, ""no that's not me""
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis]
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive

[Verse 3: Aaron Lewis]
Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made
""Don't tread on me"" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Outro: Charlie Daniels]
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes, 'cause this is America, and a country boy is good enough for me, son"

Rip TideSick Puppies,"You all hate your children
They're too fat to feed

Not Strong EnoughApocalyptica,"I'm not strong enough to stay away
Can't run from you, I just run back to you
Like a moth, I'm drawn in to your flame
Say my name, but it's not the same

You look in my eyes, I'm stripped of my pride
And my soul surrenders, and you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

I'm not strong enough to stay away
What can I do? I would die without you
In your presence, my heart knows no shame
I'm not to blame, cause you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

There's nothing I can do, my heart is chained to you
And I can't get free
Look what this love's done to me

And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

Not strong enough, strong enough
Not strong enough, strong enough to stay away
Not strong enough, strong enough
Not strong enough, strong enough

Let it go, let it die

[Verse 5]
It's a new day for the faceless
Take the torches from the useless
First amendment, second guesses
All dependant, I'll do anything to help you

[Verse 6]
Fallen crosses, new alliance
Deep thinkers, modern science
Open guest list, all inclusive
No-one loses, everything you've always wanted

[Verse 7]
Honest answers for the bruises
Full disclosure, no excuses
Open handshake, clean slate
No hate, living history

[Outro]
Misery, information, revolution
Loading up for execution
Push the button, pull the trigger, I am everything
You are me, I am you"
For The SummerRay Lamontagne And The Pariah Dogs,"Rolling through these hills, I've known I'd be coming
Ain't a man alive, that likes to be alone
Been a while since I'd seen my lady smile
Have I been, Have I been away so long

I am tired, I am tired

Can I come home
For the summer?
I could slow down for a little while
Get back to loving each other
Leave all those long and lonesome miles behind

Through the years I have learned some things worth telling

But you'd be right in guessin', that each and every lesson, they were hard

I am tired, I am tired

Can I come home
For the summer?
I could slow down for a little while
Get back to loving each other
Leave all those long and lonesome miles behind

Don't follow, where ever she goes
You love her and you just want her to know
You'll follow, you'll find a way
You love her, you just want her to know"
Windows Are Rolled DownAmos Lee,"Look up child
The world is born
Shoe's untied
And your soles are worn

Windows are rolled down
Sun is setting high
Windows are rolled down
I'm fixin' to die

Corn rows have companion feel
This rocky road and this steering wheel
Who do you call to ease your pain
I hope for you to get through this rain

Windows are rolled down
Moon is hanging low
Windows are rolled down

Think it's time for me to go hey-ay-ay-a............-ay

Is it what you dreamed it'd be
Are you locked up in this fantasy
Oh this miles that have
Torn us apart
My new found faith
And my broken heart

Windows are rolled down
Sun is rising high
Windows are rolled down
Feel that wind rushing by hey-ay-ay-a.......

Windows are rolled down"
ChangingThe Airborne Toxic Event,"[Verse 1]
All these buckets of rain
I've heard enough about
You say that I lie
I am a gentleman
Didn't I ask for a place I could stay?
What were we both thinking?
The next part just got in the way

[Hook 1]
You were just always talking about changing, changing
What if I was the same man, same man
The same I always was

[Verse 2]
All these things that you say
Like I'll forget about
The mind-numbing games that you play
I am a gentleman
Didn't I pay for every laugh every dime
Every bit every time?
And then you feed me some lie

[Hook 2]
I won't hear one more word about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man
Same man I've always been

[Bridge]
Days pass, turn into weeks
When we don't even speak
We just lay wide awake
And pretend we're asleep
And you go home alone
And you're checking your phone
And you're looking at me
Like I'm something you own

[Verse 3]
All these buckets of rain
You can't forget about
You say I never try
I am a gentleman
Didn't I answer every time that you called?
Pick you up when you fall?
But you never listen at all

[Extro]
You were just always talking about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man
Changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man
Changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man"

Been cheatin' gravity and waitin' on the fall
How did this come over me, I thought I was above it all?

Country SongSeether,"[Verse 1]
Well, I can't stand to look at you now
This revelation's out of my hands
Still, I can't bear the thought of you now
This complication's leaving me scared

Stay when you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey, keep your sickness off me
Tryin' to get through
Blame all your weakness on me
Shame that I'm so contrite
Hey keep your fingers off me
Why can't I get through?

This sublimation's outta my hands

You stay cause you think you want me

Take what you want, but just leave me alive
Say what you want, but you're not gonna win this time
Take what you want, but just leave me alive

You Are A TouristDeath Cab For Cutie,"This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher

When there's a burning in your heart
An endless yearning in your heart
Build it bigger than the sun
Let it grow, let it grow
When there's a burning in your heart
Don't be alarmed

This fire grows higher

When there's a doubt within your mind
Because you're thinking all the time
Framing rights into wrongs
Move along, move along
When there's a doubt within your mind

When there's a burning in your heart
And you think it'll burst apart
Or there's nothing to fear
Save the tears, save the tears
When there's a burning in your heart

And if you feel just like a tourist in the city you were born
Then it's time to go
And define your destination
There's so many different places to call home
Because when you find yourself the villain in the story you have written
It's plain to see
That sometimes the best intentions are in need of redemptions
Would you agree?
If so please show me

This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher

When there's a burning in your heart
When there's a burning in your heart
When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher)
When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher)
When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher)"

Lies Of The Beautiful PeopleSixx: A.M.,"[Instrumental]

Well this ain't no sideshow
This is the great unknown
This is the poison we take
Yeah
Outside the velvet rope
Standing there all alone
Are the grotesque and ashamed
Yeah

Well if you think real beauty's on the outside
Well that's a far cry
From the truth
Maybe all the information you received
Well you should not believe
There's no proof

Save yourself from all the lies of the beautiful people
It's time to run from the lies of the beautiful people

I feel so traumatized
Doped up and televised
Life can be cruel and insane
Yeah
But we've got these ugly scars
On our infected hearts
Maybe it's time for a change
Yeah

And if you think real beauty's on the outside
Well that's a far cry
From the truth
Maybe all the information you received
Well you should not believe
There's no proof

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]
Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser
Back on the mic, it's the anti-depressor
Ad-Rock--no pressure--yes, we need this
The best is yet to come and, yes, believe this
Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Sip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo
Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino
Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino
I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes, they age like wine as I get older
I'm getting bolder, competition is wanin'
I got the ball and I see the lane and

[Chorus]
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]
Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection
I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a Fizzy-Lifting Drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just riffingAnd when I catch MCs, it's time for wing clipping
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
Cause I'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong

We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right

The break is crazy
Crazy-crazy

[Verse 3: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]
Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say, ""That's my old self""
Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!)
The forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance
Parlay romancing into financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt

We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight

I am now an instrument of violence

Stepping down to battle another day

Remember me for all time
This determination is a vital part of me
Surrender now, or be counted
With the endless masses that I will defeat

I can't be told to compromise this
They'll never doubt the body lying at my feet
A most formidable reminder
They will speak my name for eternity

I am a weapon, powerful beyond belief
Seen through the warriors eyes
I never need to question how to defeat you

The entire world will stare
Into this battlefield, tonight

With a warriors heart, now
I can feel the strength that will

Old ManRedlight King,"He didn’t have much
A pair of hard working hands
Everything that I needed
I got it from the old man
With a nine second dream
He drove the Redlight Bandit
And the grease on his hands
Was the way he commanded
And the life he demanded
It kept us all in a struggle
When he ruled with his fist
It kept us all out of trouble
Even though he would leave
He wore his heart on his sleeve
And by the way that he walked
He taught me how to believe

Old man look at my life
Take a look, take a look
Old man look at my life
Cause I’m a lot like you
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Take a look, take a look
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Cause I’m a lot like you

Growin’ up at the track
He had a reason for being fast
His heart felt like breaking
He’d look right up at the ceiling and
Start again, never breathe a word of his loss
Cause it’s not about winning
It’s the rivers you cross
And the pain that you feel
Could be the fuel that you use
And if you’re in need of direction
Be it the path that you choose
My old man is a legend
He cast a shadow so great
I think of how he is watchin’
With every move that I make

Old man look at my life
Take a look, take a look
Old man look at my life
Cause I’m a lot like you
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Take a look, take a look
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Cause I’m a lot like you

Now there’s no slowin’ down
There’s only settin’ the pace
No more dreams to be stolen
Just the right ones to chase
You’ve been through the worst
Now you know who to trust
Leave them something behind
Before the ashes and dust

Old man look at my life
Old man look at my life
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Cause I’m a lot like you
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Cause I’m a lot like you
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Take a look, take a look
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Cause I’m a lot like you
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Take a look, take a look
Old man, old man take a look at my life
Cause I’m a lot like you"

Ghost Of Days Gone ByAlter Bridge,"[Verse 1]
The misery I know
Like a friend that won't let go
Is creeping up on me now once again
So I sing this song tonight
To the ghost that will not die
And somehow it seems to haunt me till the end

Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the ghost of days gone by

I remember summer days
We were young and unafraid
With innocence we'd glide beneath the stars
It seems so long ago
Beyond the life that I now know
Before the years would have their way and break my heart

Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the ghost of days gone by

With each day I feel the end
I... don't wanna die
Don't wanna die, don't wanna die

I don't wanna die

For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again

For the days gone by
Do they haunt you like a ghost until the end

[Outro]
Haunt you 'til the end
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end"
IridescentLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When you were standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying, ""Save me now""
You were there, impossibly alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go"
LowlifeTheory Of A Deadman,"[Verse 1]
You know I'll be the one who gets falling down drunk
At my neighbor kid's soccer game
I've got an '82 Fiero with a car seat in the middle
Broken down on the interstate
I've got a beer-stained t-shirt, looking like Joe Dirt
Something 'bout me just ain't right
I'm a cash-stealing, drug-dealing loser without any feeling
Getting trailer trashed tonight

[Chorus]
'cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm loving it
I've got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
No, you can't change something that you don't understand

[Verse 2]
I'm thrilled to be a hillbilly, hate to have to deal with me
Probably just end in a fight
No sleeves, can't read, doesn't even phase me
Naked, sleeping like a baby tonight

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Living it up, living it up
Being a lowlife

[Verse 3]
A gun-packing, bitch-smacking, mess with me, it's gonna happen
Loving life, living in sin
Passed out, on the floor, sorry, just don't work no more
Giving up on giving in
Ah, fuck it!

[Chorus 2]
Cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm lovin' it
I'm never gonna change as long as I live
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
Cause deep down I really know everyone is

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Living it up, living it up
Being a low life"
Two Against OneDanger Mouse,"Make no mistake I don't do anything for free
I keep my enemies closer than my mirror ever gets to me
And if you think that there is shelter in this attitude
Wait till you feel the warmth of my gratitude

One
I get the feeling that it's two against one
I'm already fighting me, so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a gun
Lucky for me I'm not the only one

And if it looks to me like you and your reflection
Plan to add your own fight to this dimension
Then tell it that this ain't no free-for-all to see
There's only three
It's just you and me against me

One
I get the feeling that it's two against one
I'm already fighting me so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a gun
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
Lucky for me I'm not the only one

And if your foot soldiers, sycophants, and yes men
Plan to break into the middle of this little plan
Then they should plan to hear me say
That I won't play around the way
Anyway, I plan to plan around them

One
I get the feeling that it's two against one
I'm already fighting me so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a gun
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
Lucky for me I'm not the only one"

What Ya Gonna DoHinder,"[Verse 1]
I'm living life with no regrets
They're on their way buy ain't here yet
I just left Las Vegas in bad, bad shape
I only call home if I get the chance
Every other night a new romance
Wake up just in time to miss the day
And now I'm talking to the man in the mirror
And I think I heard him say

What ya gonna do

And I'm still closing down these streets
I'm high enough to make believe
That I ain't ever gonna hit the ground
The one that got away from me
Every now and then she calls to see
If I'm alive or plan to settle down
Well, I called her drunk last night
And I think I heard her say

Getting louder every night

From The CloudsJack Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Oh, you're such a pretty thing
I'll take you and I'll make you all mine
I will steal you from this patient world let it chase us
It could never take you back

We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours

To know I'm lucky to have you

You're so sweet to me
In a world that's not always fair

Digital, did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?

My advice isn't going to change, dysfunction over fashion
I think you're all ashamed, too ashamed to admit your faults
No daylight in the bunker, just darkness in the vaults

Goodbye, there's only one way out of this
But do we have the nerve to try?
Because there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye
Goodbye, there's only one way out of this
But do we have the nerve to try?
Because there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye

Miss AmericaSaving Abel,"Hello mother, it's been long
I'm still here fighting, be proud of your son
My friends are dying
And I just wanna come home

The stars are under a different sky
Your prayers must be working 'cause I'm still alive
This place is so cold
And I just wanna come home

I'm fighting, I'm bleeding
I know what's coming but I'm still breathing
Not giving up, not losing love
Not running away, I'm not afraid

I'm Miss America, my Miss America
When does the fighting end?
Where does the freedom begin?

Hey there, love, how have the kids been?
Wish I could be there to tuck them in
But freedom is calling
While your tears are falling

I've seen lines broke in two
Through these eyes red white and blue
I know why I'm here
Still I just wanna go home

Where does the freedom begin? Oh

My hair stands on its end
Chilling thoughts as I defend
Running for cover, take cover, my brother
To die another day as that man I yet waste

Hey there, son, it's your time to go
I'm so proud more than you'll know
But freedom ain't free
And now you're just like me, yeah

I'm fighting, I'm bleeding
I know what's coming but I'm still breathing

Not running away, I'm not afraid

Feel a sadness burning in my heart
You left too early, father love
So many things I should have said
But in your mind you knew it well
Holding onto what I got and love
But things still seems so dark and cold
The fire burning down my happiness
But I will rise

So proud and strong you truly were
I took it with me as a tool
A gift from father to his only son
Watching over me with eagle eyes
You gave me freedom to a life
Where dreams are born and truly became real

See me falling, yeah down and lonely
Are the angels on their way, I'm in the dirt
Hear me screaming, see me bleeding
'Cause the day's no more the same without you

Promise me my son you always will
Cherish what you love believing in
Never lose your values, stand up for the day
Oh, dear father, I thank you for the years
I'm writing this song on your desk
Together we can make it through the day

See me falling, yeah down and lonely
Are the angels on their way, I'm in the dirt
Hear me screaming, see me bleeding

The Ballad Of Mona LisaPanic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to
Assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a
Taste of what you paid for

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

[Chorus]
Whoa, Mona Lisa, you're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa, I'd pay to see you frown

[Verse 2]
He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

Whoa, Mona Lisa, you're guaranteed to run this town

Mona Lisa, wear me out

I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off

Something to hold onto
Give me something
That links me to you
Give me something
Something to hold onto

Where your fingers lock with mine

The AfterlifePaul Simon,"[Verse 1]
After I died, and the makeup had dried, I went back to my place
No moon that night, but a heavenly light shone on my face
Still I thought it was odd, there was no sign of God just to usher me in
Then a voice from above, sugar coated with Love, said, ""Let us begin""

[Chorus]
You got to fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line[x2]

[Verse 2]
OK, a new kid in school, got to follow the rule, you got to learn the routine
Whoa, there's a girl over there, with the sunshiny hair, like a homecoming queen
I said, ""Hey, what you say? It's a glorious day, by the way how long you been dead?""
Maybe you, maybe me, maybe baby makes three, but she just shook her head

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Buddha and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat
Had to stand in the line, just to glimpse the divine, what you think about that?
Well it seems like our fate to suffer and wait for the knowledge we seek
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line, no one here likes a sneak

[Chorus]

[Outro]
After you climb, up the ladder of time, the Lord God is near
Face to face, in the vastness of space, your words disappear
And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love, and the current is strong
But all that remains when you try to explain is a fragment of song
Lord is it, Be Bop A Lu La or Ooh Poppa Do
Lord, Be Bop A Lu La or Ooh Poppa Do
Be Bop A Lu La"
Every Teardrop Is A WaterfallColdplay,"[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear

Walk around my head all night, you

Make It Stop (September's Children)Rise Against,"[Intro]
Woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Bang bang go the coffin nails
Like a breath exhaled, then gone forever
It seems like just yesterday
How did I miss the red flags raised?
Think back to the days we laughed
We braved these bitter storms together
Brought to his knees he cried
But on his feet he died
What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?
What God could?

[Chorus]
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

[Verse 2]
Bang bang from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls, the shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking, I demand
From the nation under God
I feel its love like a cattle prod
Born free but still, they hate
Born me, no I can't change
It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me, let's prove them wrong

[Chorus]
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah


[Verse 3]
The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
The gatherings hold candles, but not their tongues
And too much blood has flown from the wrists
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood?
We're calling for, insisting on
A different beat, yeah
A brand new song

Make it stop, let this end
This life chose me, I’m not lost in sin
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living
Make it stop, let this end
All these years pushed to the ledge
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living"
Rumour Has ItAdele,"[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you
And boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

[Verse 2]
She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Bless your soul)
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

What You KnowTwo Door Cinema Club,"[Verse 1]
In a few weeks, I will get time
To realise it's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
I am leaving and this is starting
To feel like it's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

[Verse 2]
Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you
Could have obtained, why try anything?
I will get there; just remember, I know

[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone

Longing To BelongEddie Vedder,"I'm falling harder than I've ever fell before
I'm falling fast while hoping I'll land in your arms
'Cause all my time is spent here
Longing to belong to you

I dream of circles, perfect eyes within your face
My heart's an open wound that only you'd replace
And though the moon is rising
Can't put your picture down
Love can be frightening when you fall

And when the time is right, I hope that you'll respond
Like when the wind gets tired, the ocean becomes calm
I may be dreaming
But I'm longing to belong to you"
Roll Away Your StoneMumford,"[Verse 1]
Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
And together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside
See you told me that I would find a hole
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals

[Chorus]
""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

[Verse 2]
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But, you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home
That will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with the restart

[Chorus]
""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

[Bridge]
Stars, hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so, I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul

[Outro]
But you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine

MonsterParamore,"[Verse 1]
You were my conscience
So solid, now you're like water
And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any farther

But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

[Hook]
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours

[Verse 2]
I'm only human
I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain
Despite what you're always preaching

They call me a traitor
I'm just collecting your victims
They're getting stronger
And I hear them calling

Calling (calling)

I'll stop the whole world

And not always knowing the answers

The Last TimeAll That Remains,"[Verse 1]
Now close this chapter move on
Just one last time and I'm gone
Keep telling myself that it's under control
And that's a lie I damn well know

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll return to the scene of the crime
And I'll gather my pride
Still I know you'll be long gone
Gnaws and turns as the fear builds inside
Seems much stronger than I
Still I know you're gone

I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone

Just one last time and I'm gone

Seems much stronger than I
Still I know

I guess you helped make me strong
And when I think of what you put me through
It's better that we moved on

Soon I'll be long gone
And I walk away
And I walk away from

I won't be there I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone"
Rise Above 1Reeve Carney,"[PETER]
And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above""
But I can't
I can't

How long will it take
Before these feelings go away?
How much longer must I wait?
And are there any real answers, anyway?
Yeah

Your silence in a crowded room
Louder than the loudest tune
I hang on every word

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above""
But I can't
I can't

I miss you in everything
I was too fast travelling
To take you in
I know that silence is no crime
Just wish I could hear you fill it up
One more time

Yeah, I know what you'd say to me
Exactly what you'd say to me
I still hang on every word

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above
Yourself""

In a time of treason
Is there time for trust?
Where there's no them
Only us
Is there time for reason?
Has your heart had enough?
Is it time to let go
And rise above?

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes to love
And you said, ""Rise above
Yourself"""

Up All NightBlink-182,"[Verse 1: Tom and Mark]
Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start

Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night

Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day

Monster You MadePop Evil,"Take a good look at me now
Do you still recognize me
Am I so different inside
This world is trying to change me

Forgive me for all the damage done

Say it's not over

See I'm torn from my mistakes
And I stop believing that I could ever make things change

How long can I wait
When I can't go on like this anymore

Erase this monster I've become
Forgive me for all the damage done

Say it's not over

Isn't who I used to be
And I'm not invincible
I'm not indestructible

The beauty in me

Take a good look at me now
Can't you see I've changed

No matter what, I got your back
I will take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to god, that in the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing

So believe me when I say, you are the one
They will never forgive us for the things we have done

[Pre-Chorus]
And we will make it out alive
I will promise you this love will never die!

No matter what, I got your back
I will take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to God that in the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing

We will never fall, we will never fade
I will promise you forever and my soul today
No matter what until the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing

[Verse 4]
And everybody said that we would never last
And if they saw us now I bet they would take it back
It does not matter what we do or what we say
Cause nothing matters anyway!

[Chorus]
No matter what, I got your back
I will take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to God that in the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing

We will never fall (We will never fall)
We will never fade (We will never fade)
No matter what until the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing"
It's Not Me It's YouSkillet,"Let's get the story straight
You were a poison
You flooded through my veins
You left me broken

You tried to make me think
That the blame was all on me
With the pain you put me through
And now I know that it's not me, it's you

It's not me, it's you
Always has been you
All the lies and stupid things you say and do, it's you
It's not me, it's you
All the lies and pain you put me through
I know that it's not me, it's you, you
It's not me, it's you, you

So here we go again
The same fight we're always in
I don't care so, why pretend?
Wake me when your lecture ends

You tried to make me small
Make me fall and it's all your fault
With the pain you put me through
And now I know that it's not me, it's you

[Chorus]

Let's get the story straight
You were a poison
Flooding through my veins
Driving me insane

And now you're gone away
I'm no longer choking
From the pain you put me through
And now I know that it's not me, it's you"
Take It Or Leave ItSublime With Rome,"She's got a knack for hurting me
Is it the words she says?
The only thing that keeps me here
Are her eyes in the morning

I've packed my things a thousand times, ooh
And I've faked believe all her lies, for the last time

The other day I drew myself a map
So I could figure out your head
The canvass dripped with my sweat, blood and tears
And she hated every thread

I've packed my things a thousand times, ooh
And I've faked believe all your lies, for the last time

Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've purchased my ticket to New York
First thing in the morning
Kissing you good morning
And whispering goodbye

Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've made up my mind this time
There's no coming back for you
Oh, there's no coming back for you

Told her no purse is more important
Than the knowledge in her head
She grabbed her shit just like a baby
I can't believe the words I said

The only thing I ever see her read
Are those damn gossip magazines
They fill her head with all that nonsense, yeah
So she can fit in with the scene

I've packed my things a thousand times, ooh
And I've faked believe all her lies, for the last time

Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've purchased my ticket to New York
First thing in the morning
Kissing you good morning
And whispering goodbye

Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've made up my mind this time
There's no coming back for you
Oh, there's no coming back for you

And I always feel incomplete
She smothered herself with her own beauty
And she was born and raised as daddy's princes
But her gesture is no match for an heiress
Yea her gesture is no match for an heiress

Cause I try to love you, try to hold on to
The feeling that makes me fall for you
Oh, the feeling that makes me fall...

Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've purchased my ticket to New York
First thing in the morning
Kissing you good morning
And whispering goodbye

Cause I try to love you, try to hold on to
The feeling that makes me fall for you
That makes me fall for you

Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've purchased my ticket to New York
First thing in the morning
Kissing you good morning
And whispering goodbye

Cause I try to love you, try to hold on to
The feeling that makes me fall for you
Oh, the feeling that makes me fall

Hey MamaMat Kearney,"She don't know what she wants to be
With all the pictures in the magazines
Holding hands when she's mad at me

If I Had A Gun...Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds,"[Verse 1]
If I had a gun
I'd shoot a hole into the sun
And love would burn this city down for you
If I had the time
I'd stop the world and make you mine
And every day would stay the same with you

I'll give you back a dream
Show you now what might have been
If all the tears you cry would fade away (away, away, away...)
I'll be by your side
When they come to say goodbye
We will live to fight another day

[Chorus 1]
Excuse me if I spoke too soon
My eyes have always followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need
I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment to find me

[Chorus 2]
Hope I didn't speak too soon
My eyes have always followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need
I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment
For my heart to be unbroken by the seams

[Chorus 3]
Let me fly you to the moon
My eyes have always followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need
I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment to find me

I Will Not BowBreaking Benjamin,"[Intro]
Fall

[Verse 1]
Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath, it's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover
I don't want to change the world
I just want to leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere
All is lost again, but I'm not giving in

I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade
I will take your breath away

Fall

Watch the end through dying eyes
Now the dark is taking over
Show me where forever dies
Take the fall and run to heaven
All is lost again, but I'm not giving in

[Chorus]
I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive, paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud, cold blooded fate
I will shut the world away

I will not!

I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade

UprisingMuse,"[Verse 1]
Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

[Chorus]
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die

Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend

They will stop degrading us
They will not control us

The moon was shining on the lake at night
The Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara
I looked into your eyes and saw a light

[Verse 2]
You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn’t like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the conversation stopped
And I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
Then I said

[Chorus]
Girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
So make the move (make the move)
Cause I ain’t got all night

[Verse 3]
The rest of the summer was the best we’ve ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn’t make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad

[Verse 4]
Your mom cooked meatloaf, even though I don’t eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you
And you were right there next to me
And I said

[Chorus]
Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
I swear it's true
Without you, my heart is blue

[Bridge]
So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops and we’re facing our defeat
I’ll be next to you and you’ll be right there next to me
Then I’ll say

Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
I swear it's true
Without you, my heart is blue"

I'm hanging by a thread, the web I spin for you
If you only knew
I'd sacrifice my beating heart before I'd lose you
I still hold onto the letters
You returned, I swear I've lived and learned

It's 4:03 and I can't sleep
Without you next to me I toss and turn like the sea
If I drown tonight, bring me back to life
Breathe your breath in me
The only thing that I still believe in is you
If you only knew

[Verse 2]
If you only knew
How many times I counted all the words that went wrong
If you only knew
How I refuse to let you go even when you're gone
I don't regret any days I spent
Nights we shared, or letters that I sent

It's 4:03 and I can't sleep
Without you next to me I toss and turn like the sea
If I drown tonight, bring me back to life
Breathe your breath in me

You returned, you helped me live and learn

The sound of a fight

SaviorRise Against,"[Verse 1]
It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

[Verse 2]
There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

So tell me now
If this ain't love
Then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

While there's still something left to save.""
That's when I told her
""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have.""

And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days
That deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand
Now do you understand?

So tell me now
If this ain't love

One thousand miles away
There's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know

It takes me under
It takes me under once again

As I come clean, ah...

Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Hold me til I die

New FangThem Crooked Vultures,"[Verse 1]
New fang, no thing, had it made
To parade, found a sucker, now I want another
Stand up, step aside, open wide
Hanging out another 'til the feeling's gone
Want to? Yes, I do
Found a love, taking turns getting carpet burns
Loose lips, lipstick spit
Come and go, I think it's both, I gotta know

[Chorus]
Sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
Think you've got me confused for a better man
Sometimes you break your finger on the upper hand
Said you've got me confused, oh
I ain't a better man

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
No slack, Cadillac, couldn't quit
Gums flap so here's your teeth back
Accept what I left
Far behind in a time when my mind was like a landmine
Tailgate by the lake
Too much, too young, every button gonna come undone
Tightrope, no joke
Nothing left so you go baroque

[Chorus]
Sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
Said you got me confused with a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
I know you got me confused

[Interlude]
Oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Look out, what I've
New fang pressing down low
No more waiting around for
New fang pressing down, ah
No more waiting around, ah
New fang, new fang
They ain't gonna wait, no
New fang, new, oh
They ain't gonna wait no more"
SnuffSlipknot,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

[Chorus 1]
So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

[Verse 2]
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

[Chorus 2]
So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

[Guitar solo]

Oh, oh

[Chorus 3]
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

Use SomebodyKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

[Chorus]
Someone like you

Off in the night, while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat

Back Against The WallCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
Tonight, I'll have a look and try to find my face again
Buried beneath this house, my spirit screams and dies again
Out back, a monster wears a cloak of Persian leather
Behind the TV screen, I've fallen to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

[Verse 2]
Blanket of silence makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
Burn all the evidence of fabricated disbelief
Pull back the curtains, took a look into your eyes
My tongue has now become a platform for your lies

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

[Chorus]
Now you know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Oh God, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall

[Verse 3]
Deep in the jungle, camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
A hand holds up the sky while, shamefully, I make my plea
The altar's calling, but my legs won't seem to stand
Guess I'm a coward scared to face the man I am

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

[Chorus]
Now you know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Oh God, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Now you know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Oh God, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall"
New DivideLinkin Park,"[Verse 1]
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

[Bridge]
In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
Across this new divide"

Don’t cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be

Release what’s been killing me

Overwhelmed, you chose to run
Apathetic to the stunned
It's your decision

When you lie
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside

And here you stand before us all and say ""It's over, It's over""

Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peek

Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand

That everything, everything ends

Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst

Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand

That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends

The sun crawls across your bedroom
A halo, a waiting room
Your last breath's moving through you

As everything, everything ends

MonsterSkillet,"[Verse 1]
The secret side of me I never let you see
I keep it caged but I can't control it
So stay away from me, the beast is ugly
I feel the rage and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls
It comes awake and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

[Verse 2]
My secret side I keep hid under lock and key
I keep it caged but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out, he'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end!

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

[Bridge]
It's hiding in the dark, its teeth are razor sharp
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream, maybe it's just a dream
Or maybe it's inside of me, stop this monster

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I’m gonna lose control, it’s something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster"

Ever feel alone
Ever feel like crying

Ever feel life pushing shoving you away
Ever feel like breaking down funeral in the rain

Feel like slipping away

Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain - better believe it

Down inside a grave
Listen to the eulogy
A buyer of the hate
Ever dance beside the devil
Taste the barrel of a gauge
Ever pull the trigger
The light begins to fade

Feel like slipping away

You're a beautiful wreck, now you're out of control
Crossing the double lines

You don't stop for the signs
Heartbreak waiting to happen
Headlights cut through the rain
Tears hit the windshield
And I can't look away

Feels like you're shattered and covered in broken glass

Every turn, every shoulder you feel
But I'm right here when it's just too much

Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified

Cover up your wounds
Lost in a finger forced to lie

Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all

Told to dissolve, or choose to fade
Or stay here you'll live

(Hey, hey)
She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
You grow up quick when you grow up poor
It's the only way to LA that she knows
The Hollywood pose: teeth, tits, and toes

So many Five Star friends with black credit cards
She'd try anything once
'Cause anything goes
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold

[Chorus]
(Hey, hey)
Well, she ain't no Cinderella
When she's getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands

[Verse 2]
(Hey, hey)
I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
City Hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look
Every A-List player is her favorite friend
Since they all taste the same in the back of the Benz
A congressman would call her every once in a while
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
She'd done everyone once and everyone knows
You gotta get a little dirty when you're digging for gold

Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best

Far too pretty to be giving it cheap

And now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
You're a marionette in the center of
The twisting strings coming from above
It may seem too deep to recover from
It's so easy to see, everyone can agree, just let it go

[Chorus]
I know you've heard it before
But then it wasn't enough
You don't wanna be held back from the substitution
I know you've seen this before
And now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Bridge]
When the voices start spinning, just be aware
I have brought enough stones for us to share
That one's grinning, that one's burning aim for the throat
Let 'em choke on the stones that we are to throw

It's the great downfall
The big overthrow
If you shoot them down
It'll make you soar

[Verse 3]
When reactions turn into hurricanes
And the middle ground seems a little tame
Whether full or empty it's all the same
It's so easy to see, everyone can agree, you're not to blame

[Chorus]
I know you've heard it before
But then it wasn't enough
You don't wanna be held back from the substitution
I know you've seen this before
But now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry"

Heyy
Heeey
Heey

[Verse 1]
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you
Blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you
In every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister

Just in time
I'm so glad you have
A one track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection

My heart is bound to beat right out
My untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna
Blow your mind

Way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

EyesoreJanus,"Hearing your words out of my mouth again
Leaves me stuck with the key to
All
These reasons you got in my head again
Buried here inside of me
Return all
Of this to sender
The mirror spoke to me and showed
All of this pretending
Is catching up to me
Lights out. Wake up. Stay calm. Decide
Reach up
Stand or be an eyesore
Staring out and over these words again
Makes me
Start to believe that
Wearing your lies over these words of mine
Always feels
Like my mistake
Nothing is more important
Than what people think about
You
The worry, the wonder... it's all worth it"

You were going to bed
But I'm not done with the night
So I stayed up and read

Got me mixed up so I turned out the light

My mind's racing from chasing pirates

Now an ambulance screams
While the silliest things
(Are) flopping around in my brain
And I try not to dream
Up impossible schemes

If only for a second
I see it twinkling in your eye
Gotta try

Well it's flesh and blood and camouflage
Straight into the wall now something's gotta give
Just another act of sabotage
Seen through the haze of a mind-rot sedative

When will you realize my friend
Lord in the end now you can't take it with
Gotta live

If only for a second
I see it twinkling in your eye

The world that you're forsaking
Is surely more than just a lie

FirefliesOwl City,"[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

'Cause I feel like such an insomniac

Why do I tire of counting sheep?

When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

Would you be sorry if I swore that I'd be there

Shake it out, shake it out

I am the living ghost of what you need
I am everything eternally, God, just speak

To peel off all my skin
And I felt the weight within
Reveal a bigger mess
That you can't fix

Don't stop, don't ever go
I swear you'll never know

And my bitch too entertainin', see the note, you gotta stay up
Taking bets on that I'll fail, It's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face, I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits to get a world records, who's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?
Well maybe not, but I tried, though, Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino, 'cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow, turned my L's into W's, typo
Uh, hop into the track, give you the love and you give it right back
10 different flows I'd be spitting, some trap and some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for, like, a year, and now, my writing's clear, I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say, ""I'm not here to play""?
""He got a flow and a voice now, I remember when he choking a boy out
But he's back in showin' no choice now, don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?""
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how, cut his beat, I'll be blaring  'em so loud
We'll be talk about bitches and money, this shit be so funny, my parents are so proud, damn
I'm starting to try, trying the shots at it, look at the grind and see stars on the sky
Drawing the line, all of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high, if you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copying guys, you better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
30,000 words on a track, little bitch, now these people turn my vid' on and react, little bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, little bitch, and you giving me a headache, where the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doing all I can, and I did it in the past-tense, making all this money up off of YouTube off [?] AdSense
Money up off of YouTube off AdSense, all of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop, Eminem holds the world record for Rap God
1.6K words, though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour, and I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, all of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters, and they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done, 'cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top, and we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months, then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eating in this bitch, uh, y'all better, take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit, 'cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it, that subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat, I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap, old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as an intro, now, we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see coming, I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!

[Part II]

[Intro]
Heh, aye!
Aye, aye
Uh, switch up
Yeah, aye, aye, aye

[Verse 2]
Look out the window, see past it, but we're fainting reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You heading down the wrong path and they changing directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessing
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stopping these conversations
Hey, how long you waiting till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplating and stop complaining
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place, but you still vibing that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We heading on to new platforms and leaving the basics

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playing lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing going
I've been watching all these shows while I could be showing
I've been- creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changing them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't- even comprehend that much in the future
Hating the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fucking intruder
Stealing all these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinating 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser

[Verse 4]
Sittin' alone at 3:00 a.m
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, ""I must behave, Ben""
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this rock and I'm rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
It's obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test this system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain I just alleviated
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
Givin' dignity cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind

[Hook 1]
And I'm in time
But I keep on workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb

[Verse 5]
Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this 10-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, ""Bye"", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline

[Interlude 1]
Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been 11 minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter

[Verse 6]
How can I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury, nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different, I mean, it's all seeming to be, and it's in inconceivable dreaming?
I know it's so unbelievable, being stuck in this real unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving, they givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing what life could be like on the different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone so I know when and where to cross it
All over the place, I'm surprised I haven't lost it, aye, yeah

[Hook 2]
And I'm feeling like I'm at the top
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm standing up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage
Take the trash out, but I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout

[Verse 7]
Okay, it's time to go fast, so sit back and relax, and then just maybe you'll get it
About to, but you mad and say it, you gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second, I have some lyrics in the past, but I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track [?], mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit, want you to come back and pass a message
Never pack bags and trash, you left it, kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it, if I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it, think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it, if this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this, force is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else, people want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to live out my endeavors, still'd be better than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh

[Hook 3]
And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down
More focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds

[Verse 8]
Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People tell me that I'm falling short, looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that, I'm.. not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-teasin' rapper, but I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find, lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life, I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions, so much knowledge, I can't use some lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession, I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it, I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are ugly fools, but they just don't understand that I'm through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improving it, I got my brain, and I'm using it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playing and taking and making this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless, 90% of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds are so limited, get off your higher-ass 'cause now it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now, success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now, I'ma get to it, that is what living's about

[Interlude 2]
Uh, God
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 9]
Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, ""Reach for the skies""
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I've seen through its lies
I'm just tryin' to tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryin' to sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, ""Why?""
So I can summarize my life through my breathing inside
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried, yeah
Hopped in this life and I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, yeah
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A
I'm screamin', ""Hi"", to the sky with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All the steps that I have taken to find my place
Swept out to ocean, so lonely waves feel like an embrace
Now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality would ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)
And as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
Now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', ""I got that paper on me""
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They think cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm an awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Throughout half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like an active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, yeah
I swear the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove, so they know that it's real
30 seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, this a motherfucking thesis statement
Came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with somethin' to leave
So when I wake up every day with someone to be, damn

[Verse 10]
Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous, and
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So- when people say you can't, that makes you wanna' get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna' find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful at the very least

[Verse 11]
Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping, block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so, obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous
When they don't understand that I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

[Verse 12]
Gotta re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna' show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna' win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control, option, delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Wanna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet, but-
But time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna' show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna' show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so.. maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, I've
Got a lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please, let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
I just try to combine everything into this compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in, but-
When I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna' blow up, bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck- so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn

[Interlude 3]
Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this 30,000 words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it

[Verse 13]
My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever, okay, okay
I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watching this, take a drink too
These are some shit that you can drink to

[Interlude 3]
But drink water
Unless you're of age, you know what I'm saying? Aye
Okay, okay
Uh
Uh

[Verse 14]
I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
And most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
Uh, but still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this, is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find a great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink, or in a cup
Or in some bling, or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much

[Verse 15]
I'm so Jong and Ill, like the dictator
What I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like 10 years old
But still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go
And I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow
And I may be [?], but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic
And I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in success [?] inside
I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
You set on the wrong, forgetting the right
Like, 2:00 a.m. in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, [?] in the [?]
Go off to bed in the night
I'm getting it like I be livin' in first class
I know that you never will surpass
I'm getting the worst task for this burnt cash
Whenever I work fast
Remember the memos, and sendin'-and sendin' again
And again and again and it never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented
And every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying
You really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars
With meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars
But you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit
Crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
Singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen
And makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way
Y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other 14 year old
Is at 100K?
I'm- making the most of a crazier flow
So many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home
I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it
Even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it
Leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich
Reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've [?], they so now they're receiving it
Agreeing to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope
I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate
I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause- I am on top of it
Lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant
Positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck
Though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts
And I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage
Flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it
But really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin'
I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something
Called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
I'm gettin' better, that don't hurt
And you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher
Slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love
Call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough
And I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success
And I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
This chart is like a parabola
Thank you, Lord, for havin' up
And so, every day, I take one step up
Man, I am takin' the ladder up
A hundred-thousand, we get the plaque
Lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that
We ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you done whining
I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining
All my skills into one finding
We run rhymes, you know we do
We got the shit that we're going through
These lyrics go over you
You don't miss 'em, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it
Thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac
And Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers
Shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me
When all of the others abandon me
Drama, we move past that
I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast
So many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly
Now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I-
Never an-ticipated where there would be
And seeya', so long now
Off to the end of the song now
See ya' next [?] 500 and a million
It's on now

[Interlude 4]
It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, aye

[Hook 4]
When I walk up in the scene, I hear an orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
Aye, I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but God damn, I got the formula , aye
People always asking Ben, ""Why you record so much?""
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up

[Verse 16]
Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, aye
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Aye, still saying, ""Who woulda thought?"", like, who would of guessed it, huh?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook

[Verse 17]
Aye, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, ""No,"" and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, ""Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?""
I don't get it, I don't really understand, I've been living like
""Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams
Do I really wanna stand next to all these average fucking sad duds?""
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one

[Hook 5]
Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Aye
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he

[Verse 18]
'Cause he's been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making 'u'-minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I need to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one

[Verse 19]
By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserves some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I taking a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well we nearing 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

[Interlude 5]
That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago before I recorded this
Aye, aye
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh

[Hook 6]
Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, aye

[Verse 20]
Uh, wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that one day you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never
I think I'm so clever, but in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a- go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get As, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Damn... but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique, and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, ""OMG, relatable!""
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting- years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money, and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it

[Interlude 6]
Okay
Okay, okay
We're like 30 minutes in, 30 minutes, but we got 30,000, bro
Fuck

[Verse 21]
Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all of the 'mc' squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of is
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's about the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
One of the fuckin' nuns started, like, really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words
About how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, [?] for certain
You keep it

[Verse 22]
You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny- I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

[Verse 23]
In Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chilling with them women, you know they be tense
They'd be tense or more, they'd be tense or more
I like to talk to all these people, 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listeners are trying to make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doing, they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowing
Damn, I've been living in a headache
Bitches never listening, they saying that they ready
But... I can never believe them
Got these goal and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willing to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doing, next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm living out
In my mind's eye, giving out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps lower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all filling pages that have nothing
Ooo, but I have got something to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speaking from late nights, I'm thinking of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinking, one day, I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in the music I use to influence
I do this to way harder than people assuming
Resuming my writing, viewing this lighting
And that puts me to be in the view of the hiding
I do what they liking, but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowing, the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded base-s
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living, in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-e-n, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at this face
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doing, I'm already prepared
I've been waiting like 30,000 years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even 17, 18, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me
Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it
That people say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on a stages, and now I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb those whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one on vacation
I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first
But that radio station playing it, and making it just get to the worst, my head's gonna burst
If I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah
Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey.. nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you did this
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, ""Oh, this kid is big""
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh.. I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so gentle I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving, time to change, and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to that mother, kids, the mother kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B

[Interlude 7]
I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!

[Verse 24]
We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm- chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite the fact
That I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim or hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya'- round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man

[Hook 8]
So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But- what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?

[Verse 25]
I've seen people misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can- feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
No shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit
I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms
To help you listen to original bits
I- have got a lot of digital prints
Man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable
'Cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire, you can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if yo discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid

[Verse 26]
Aye, yo', what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, ho'
Yeah, when I bug out in it then I gotta
Stay low you know I'm coming at them
Shakes like you same boat wait so inhale
The fumes while I paint this picture me
I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Trying to make my most wild a huge any
Famous I knew that to some shit I
Couldn't do I was jaded then somehow I'm
Next up yeah I'm blessed up now I wake
Up and I'm fly I don't dress up now I'm
Flying my opponents better catch up I
Get my check sir
All y'all need a step up I remember
Trying to practice my cadence and tracks
I was making I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash and
They were right but I tarnish it and
Made a right shit is day and night now I
Gotta take a plate and Vegas might not
Stay the night everybody see me eat and
Now they wanted to take a place one like
Ok no way yeah when it comes to this
Shit man I don't play I'm like Houdini
And my ghost you can't see me I'm gone
But so hard I gotta wear my Easy's to
Prom you two bitches asking me to
Retweet day songs I'm the reason people
Got Spotify Premium on
Like, aye, yo' what you say though?
But I could come and straight out of the
Bay though you'll when our workout in a
10 I gotta stay low you know I'm running
To them checks like Usain Bolt
So I'm like ok not no way but a
Constitution man I don't play if you ask
Me I got 'em I will say I'm gonna drive
You over looking over the roadway, uh

[Interlude 8]
Damn
Some of these are
Too slow and less and also too fast
Whatever

[Verse 27]
I'm out of order three oh it's
Like I'm Santa Claus pull up on your
Bitch babe buddy with a camouflage hey
Now here what's the play now I'm trying
To slide I attack him about a playground
Yeah I remember bottom phase I would
Stay down 20K still in in my PayPal, so
What the fuck you wanna say you wanna
Say now nothing
Best in my town and as note these
Sketches humble beginning say humble we
Win it if I wanna bag that's my humble decision
Everything I do is going off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, aye

[Interlude 9]
I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die

[Hook 9]
I think she blocked me on
The Instagram I need to know what that I
Do I guess I missed your plan if me I'm
The searching for the troopers shit
Where is it man I never know just wanted
You to help me understand I need some
Closure because truthfully I give a damn
I gave a damn plenty of fish in the sea
But see I ain't no pleasure man see I'm
A middle man of it man and it means it's
There digging in the sand looking for a
Reason I'm not kidding man

[Verse 28]
How am I gonna let all of this get to me? Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity, ain't no way that you can mess with me
And in the big picture, this shit doesn't matter, but right now, It's feeling like everything
The more I think about it, it just gets sadder, I 'member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' about so many things, what did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things, I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it and all of the things that I'd said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked? I just cannot wrap my head around it

[Interlude 10]
I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watching this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment, ""Arrowhead water"", in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of 10
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real- that you're real one
You know what I'm saying? Alright, here we go

[Verse 29]
Spectacular speculations, I'm havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements that's travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and reality left them baseless
I wish that we left them nameless, associate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations and watch as their heads are shaking
These people want me to crumble and turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation and focus on education

[Hook 10]
But I'm petty petty petty petty, that's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit, that I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram, I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think that love is either gold or a scam, and you never really know till the end, like, how all this began

[Verse 30]
I've been comin' at this as a man, trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly, and I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's how it goes when they stalk me and do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes when a basic bitch try to block me, uh

[Verse 31]
Livin' life, but you stay the same how you expect
Yourself to go take the fan making name
But you don't take the pen you wanna be
Unique but not make it change like what
How you expect to go through this think
About the girls man why you wanna do is
So stupid and useless if you never lose
It with yourself a little for the
Movement when I write the St. the ode to
Joy' this the oldest success don't know
If there is a God but I know that I'm
Blessed and I'm hoping to know and I'm
Open to yes I'll do whatever I can to go
To the best that will go to the right
And go to the left no doubt imma show up
At night instead of going to bed when I
Know that I'm right I'm exploding my
Chest I keep on loading the time and it
Goes over my head I think no why do I
Even try these things I need shiny
Things like diamond rings and flying
Rings and preci bling that is what
Drives these strains I'm so I'm so
Lively and lazy at the same time saying
Something sane and crazy in the same
Rhyme never go to practice who don't
Faze me 'til it's game time
Learning his life will amaze me how I
Made my define a minute
When a wetland is favorite the mik
Children they get so pissed with me I'm
Either villain now they no kidding and
No I'm not quitting I know I'm just
Sitting sitting with a dream and maybe
Maybe just sit in this city where the
Dream could take me but I know it can't
I know it tastes look I'm angry why I
Just the B of the A-team at the
Feet of the mainstream man I dream for
This daydream and I believe that I'm
Making it cease for the taking it's me
In a train and I see that I'm breaking
My knees aren't place and I keep on
Thinking that I'm being amazing but I'm
Improving I know it's just a slow climb
Pushing myself yeah I'll be there in no
Time so I'm moving I'm moving till I get
There get where I just don't want to get
Left there

[Interlude 11]
I don't remember I don't even
Know what that's from but that was
Written in there it's been a lot of late
Nights okay

[Hook 11]
I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I’m threatening, they don’t wanna let ‘em in
They told me if I take it, I’ll feel better, like it’s medicine
But I ain’t settling, they tryna’ rush me, like adrenaline

[Verse 32]
And labels don't reply so I
Can't get it deal I mean is it footage
Did someone get me a Benadryl
I got a hell of skill man they worried
That I never will a success in skills
Men are done seven mill I think about
Food by the chair I'll be going over
Putting the determinant shame in the
Hypocrites women nobody buzzer okay that
One's for you huh
I'm wanna Christmas as a Christmas gift
Middle child no I'm anything but in the
Middle bitch man I don't give a shit I'm
Behaving saw ridiculous I'm the type to
Add my fucking seat Sephora syllabus ah
Existential crisis every day I think I
Don't exist you check a little I'm a
Frying pan I'm a dying man I wake up
Every damn I make a fucking diagram and
Find a plan to be the highest man in the
Sky Atlanta rap so fucking hard I think
I'm entering my diaphragm Iron Man think
I'm Iron Man because we couldn't fire
Emojis of my entire gram I'm a fireman
Second grade teacher got me singing in
The choir man and like a word a my notes
Thought I would acquired its carbon soot
A bunch of random shit in climate man
That's so much I do not give a fuck
Let's go to Ireland under grand on those
Rubber bands hold your fucking bands
Listening to the cash register like your
Fucking Jam don't understand like a
Republican with a gun in his hand saying
That Trump is a man to come to the plan
Living in Wonderland this it is a
Fucking scam making America each other
That's dumb again, huh?

[Verse 33]
They told me I
Needed to do a switch up my friends told
Me I needed to get my hips up it ain't
That simple I'm not someone that white
Teenagers wanna be like I can't say it
Sir and a mimin hard to pick up pick up
I'm the transnational British person
Dimension c-137 is my biggest version
I'll be disturbing his music it isn't
Listed as
Urban air quotes next to my name of red
Caps that's bird and I'm a fucking
Burden to every fucking person I'm this
Earthman I'm determined either trying to
Get a book and sorted out pins and
Needles like an amateur surgeon that
Makes no sense
All these listeners are so dense the
Song is conversational so why you still
Talking to me just went out so why are
You talking to me I'm trying to give you
Free money not fondue your feet
I'm tryna to make a deal not call the
Police I have free publicity they don't
Want to be seen I guess they don't wanna
Be seen fuck these monopoly seats you're
They collapse rabble's 150 plays I hit
Him up about it away 60 days now I'm
Bigger than these rappers I'm asking I
Hit him up again and then I never get a
Response damn what the fuck is happening
Damn, I said-

[Hook 12]
F-fuck a lawsuit, fuck a lawsuit
What'd it cost me, what'd it cost you
Cost you a kike gotta stop you y'all are not cute
Huh no need to argue 'cause I do not lose, aye, uh

[Verse 34]
A who is your mama I need to
Know who taught you I need to how you
Believe it I'm sure that nobody believes
You I make it I'm making music as soon

To review you hadn't claimed a reverse
On my album are you gonna claim these

Jealous and you skeptical if I'm pretty
Selling you assuming that I can legit
Offender I'm a senior I hear what a
Prison sentence you copyright abusive

Shit his little do you know that I'm not
Afraid of you until I refuse to quit you
Stupid bitch

You don't have to steal don't like we
Hide the deal damn if I say the teller I

But Kali we had a deal me to shit ain't

Chill yet it's a new way yelling - Laney
You say you gonna start tomorrow or
Tomorrow - day I get I get all these
Bags stuff a minute suitcase with these
To be spin up clothes like you was Boonk Gang

[Interlude 12]
I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just- trying to piece it together like a puzzle
You know what I'm saying?
Aye, let's go random shit, aye

[Verse 35]
I take no credit for anything that I do
But I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seen pissed but I'm
Never getting mad at you that's the
Reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is some
Places shit nobody else's world did and
I'm just trying to spread some pieces
Love my man it's really hard cuz you
Need some love I've been waiting cuz
This is defense time for me to be laying
Out of business and I'm breathing in the
Air but it all tastes
When all of this time is wasted really
Ain't wasted

[Interlude 13]
This is trash, I don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this

[Verse 36]
It's bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, and when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good- groove is really a great recipe
Can't- mess with me, no one, I'm feeling too in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm- noddin' yes, and then I am proddin' next
And I'm tryna' to mentally send God a text
Like, ""Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel like a god
But, y-you get what I'm sayin'?""
And God damn, I just can't really express when I'm playing

[Verse 37]
Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is- something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream, shit
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got- energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, it's maybe costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this
I'm still trying to master this, 'cause now I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really- just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Trying to make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that, when I'm done, you're left sobbing
But that won't happen, like I said, we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjusting, see me bluffin'
Everyday, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna' make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is- that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason- that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin', yeah

[Interlude 14]
Nearing- we're nearing an hour if you're still
Watching the shit I love you I actually
Like love you long time
Okay

[Hook 13]
I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna'
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', I said, ""Fuck it, I'm livin'""
People are getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, aye
Aye, aye, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, eh

[Verse 38]
Yeah, time to move on, grindin' out all my new songs
My only motivation is people I need to prove wrong
Yeah
Said, my only motivation is- yeah
And, how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna' find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in my stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Man, it's scary for a king, even-, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe in it, even it up for free, and
The meaning is really scenin', no line can be wrong between em'
I don't show seasons, I am me, no matter what
And that can grow pleasin', I'm barely close to anybody
I don't know people, man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that it just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, I'm new to the life, I'm new in my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
The next minute, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
And I just wish- that they would fucking go away
And I won't obey, no I will- never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up with other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G', but now I'm movin' onto other notes, yeah

[Interlude 15]
My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting, a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- d do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights, I know the stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh

[Verse 39]
Everyone knows that it's so amazing, all the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital, my name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it, people liked it before they watched it
I'm on a way too much more than I have, and I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I got a vision of talking a lot of wisdom, and I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow, I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy, people consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses, I'm hurt because I'm on loaded bases
Advancing, I know the basics, already know them, they're overrated than me
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hoping, because now I am open for game
I'm charged up, I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players, don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares? I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers, and bitch, I am going so later
I got time, my own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines, and I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go

[Hook 14]
I've been living life all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, I'm all on my own
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own

[Verse 40]
My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
Sue a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-

[Interlude 16]
Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
10,000 more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one-take!

[Verse 41]
-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
Its not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man

[Hook 15]
Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
I ain't the star of the show, bitch

[Verse 42]
I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And if time is money then free time ain't really free
And sometimes I get pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
They stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy a lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital

[Interlude 17]
Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics
Uh

[Verse 43]
Rebirth, feet hit the earth
My knees hurt
They're weaker than
Previously, her breathing seems to be burnt like
Free CDs were before we
Could be searched
I'm like please, just please work
Like a lenient slave owner
That's edgy like gravestones
Oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley
Two percent there already
I may go for a Chevy
'Cause who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy
Uh, I've been trying’ to prove to all of the people I knew
Who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, ""Ew""
Yeah, this shit goes outta you
Plans have now all become true
Seeing them through
Man, that's the reason I do
All of the things that I do
It's not for a crew
Not for a god or a demon
I've really been needing a clue
Filling these shoes
Reading these pieces and news
Damn this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues
Whenever i'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss
Then why this ignorance be killin’ kids
And why's this ignorance is truly vicious it's not giving shit and ends up innocent
That shit really is ridiculous it's magnificently
Fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up
I've even seen it goin down, it's comin’ up-

[Verse 44]
'Kay to the Vatican having
Them good times and bad times new Romans
Do that again when I was when I was so
Young too young to really know fun but
So but I guess that's what happens when
You grow up dry your eyes and wipe your
Nose up just keep drinking till you
Throw up tell me one judge but we all
Just want to be loved and somehow get
Validated by those we hate such a
Twisted system that we've been given to
Harmful a I've been really thinking and
Faker right now is not a fake wash away
The thoughts of me along the way are all
Has changed yeah and now we looking is
So far away and it's a far away just a

[Hook 16]
Civil war
Segment war you'll be the aiming to the
Piece of what we can afford
Yeah anymore what we even living for
Yeah baby murder little piece that is a
Civil war

[Verse 45]
You know you know they be
Looking at me right now like the source
System they a better pipe down
I've been reading my essays my web page
Yeah I caught our new construction site
Now with his praise man I think I gotta
Find out all these questions man I
Really wanna hide down oh I want to drop
Out maybe learn a lot about my strip
Before our way to see it die out damn I
Just want to go along I'm holding strong
I know I know I'm not the Botes one I'm
Old enough from throwing up bars so sick
It doing that they know it's up down
Minute now I really don't know done and
A babe race like I got drafted for
Freddie year-round hype over March
Madness wanna get to what his girls
Stripping down like his know they feel
Like we takin liberal all his classes
Ay be saying damn bad when the gods
Savage number on like
I am not average-

[Interlude 18]
Hold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental
This is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick
I'm gonna fix it, take a pause
Uh, yeah, aye

[Verse 46]
I'm addicted to the screen and the
Validations of people who are 13 in
Another nation I've been looking for
Seven sent a message or a comment on a
Video it seems to be wasted like
Internet track meets they II traced it
Look at this shit I just recently made
It that's how it goes when I'm beaten
And breathing achieving and keep on
Succeed in there Haiti y'all lousy they
Can't breathe all that smoke bro you
Doubt me but just see where I'll go so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out there be me believe in my own
Zone things become intense of the heat
Of the ozone is surrounding me I need to
Go home so can I pretty please just be
All alone nobody to retweet to leave on
My home phone I ain't gonna I'm gonna
Hop in a drug shit when they all come
And they love it ain't gonna happen
Allow sure when I know I ain't about it
Yeah they're gonna take us away now they
Got something to say now you can order
This shit on a take-out
All of these this
Is a fake now

[Verse 47]
Okay so all my clothes is Japanese
I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic
Might cause a couple casualties
And all I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man I said fuck the peanut gallery
I got a fuckin' allergy
Trappin down my PayPal make it friends and family
Now I'm so hot I need some oven mitts
Ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify
They pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity
Okay so everybody 'round me they been wasting my time, ay
Pull up to the Functions and see they face when I rhyme, ay
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself
I don't need a way to get signed

[Hook 17]
Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, aye
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, aye
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, aye

[Verse 48]
Okay I'm backing
This not masking shit now everybody
Wanna go package it I don't give a
Fucking home abstinent for the whole
Game about accident when I'm gonna do
Passion it's Edison ever method okay
Happening my buddy used to hold back but
This and I hit me up like whatever
Typing in yeah I had to sacrifice a lot
Of sleep because a lot of people wanna
Love from me hey standing in the way of
Who I wanna be no random strangers
Recognize me when I cross the street

[Verse 49]
So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Put it all off to the side
Feeling the vibe, got this new sorrowful happiness
That I just can't seem to guide
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Every morning I wake up, I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
You know I put too much work into this shit just to pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not going to say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I ain't mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
I'm practicing hard
Never going back to the start, never going back to the start

[Verse 50]
You should know that I'm putting my work on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining these cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen
I'm eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping it, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist
I'm feeling the largest
I'm feeling the largest

[Part III]

[Interlude 19]
Oh!
Is that the final beat change up?
Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..
But you know what? Gotta hop on this classic beat, aye
Uh
Yeah
Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did though
Uh
Yeah
Aye

[Verse 51]
Recently I've been feeling my lyrics
Missing meaning I'm trying to whitewash
How much they stink like I'm list arena
Damn I'm feeling like I've missed the
Key and so I guess that DJ Khaled is
Always skipping me but yeah you know I'm
Trying to do what I can but these
Ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah you know I'm trying to do what I
Can but these ignorant idiots just can't
Understand I got new crews and a new
Friends got new views in the new lens on
The new dude I'm the new bank on my
YouTube but a new trance but the way I'm
Growing is so unorthodox how could I be
Connecting them áfive you had to sort
The dots sort of lost them very found at
The same time a port of cause now I'm
Very loud in a daytime and very quiet at
Night each team is shy when I write and
I'm longing to be a five-year-old
Chillin flying a kite and I admire the
Sight of somebody just working more than
Me I've been staying grounded but the
Sky is moving towards my feet and
Fortunately I'm on course Livermore
Burley grinding to get what's rightfully
Mine I'm headed right for my dream
Damn I guess that's all I needed know
For now they put me in the driver's seat
No way I'm slowing down they know me now
But don't know my son did it so profound
Give me them two years and I'll make it
Let me show you how hey, hey, hey, hey I
Got a stop all of this bragging shit so
Many haters as a mace is the acronym I'm
Trying to get a couple OMGs over WTF he
Is so sexy I got no Ben leave it be the
So deadly walked up to the rap club no
Entry and I feel a little like I won't
Get see cuz I'm so white won't fight you
Don't get me cuz I'm coming that his
Music with a different set of ideas he's
Trying to bring my own crib like it's
IKEA here's a protip
No gifts from people who are close yet
Bitch is always so stressed damn cuz
They trying to find a great escape
Nation of dreamers who are just trying
To stay awake every day I'd be waking up
To my 8 away stay today hustle I'm just
Trying to pave a way people that have
Colors always get them most advice it's
Like why don't you search your own lift
Don't come closer mind I mostly find it
So please leave me alone - whining next
Time that you're talking shit please
Bring me an open mind cause people
Loggin' they own ideas a straitjacket
Some David Blaine's magic you're helping
Your brake pads that I'm trying to raise
- I'm trying to stay savage you're
Trying to make balance while finding a
Great pageant you coming to get up this
Witness an injustice about who people in
Love with the base of a skin color
Snitchin' is so this custody in their
Public I'm trying to make sense of it
Here and it discusses close my eyes and
Go to sleep waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations I'm making
Everything so complete my thoughts i
Scattered find lots of patterns I try
Not to let akin my plots and ashes I
Don't ever think on some money some
Little talent these rappers shows look
Like lifting battles with Jimmy Fallon
We're really having I'm jealous if
People selling platinum boy see around
My life like saying the words Kendrick
Goblin is way better than average
I'm already established unforgettable
Classic y'all shit is set to go plastic
You didn't want to see me disappear like
Incredible magic cube regrettable
Attitude is upsetting my passion I'm
Gonna listen to place we're gonna simply
Gaze ajik to commute birth breakouts
Part of my baby minimal break humming
It's good enough in a bitch Eden a
Feelin if I just want to make a pulling
Up I'm putting up with all the amateurs
Or enough I'ma show him how it can be
Done I got green in our beef like a
Omnivore
I got that exclusive floater can't be
Bought at stores POTUS knew should they
Still be running more to say that my
Duty is not fair like some mana war I'm
Stuck as well just like the Michelin Man
It is sushi every night but I don't live
In
Damn I'm trying to get as many hits as I
Can and like a lazy ass beaver I ain't
Giving a damn whoa the shit's corny
You're really gonna ignore me you really
Gonna let it slide when the Benjamins do
Adore me and as you guys man it ain't
About fame and fortune we got a greater
Importance that's why awakened I'm born
And I'm trying to play her performance
Hit make a change with a chorus I came
From a tiny clap / nama stage of the
Normans let's do anything to stay out of
Office because I'm cautious it's not
Gonna sell myself for the profits yeah I
Got many dreams a lot of passions imma
Get there by any means just imagine just
Know that anything can happen to take
Chances for everything you rapping I
Don't even really need to go fast flow
Back not wonder been like a nomad so
Glad you're they don't melt like a
Snowman back-to-back flames got Drake
Saying oh man not again got a lot of
Friends who want to end on my shit and
Subscribe like I'm on a man I've been
Living in a moment got a lot of fans
Pedophile back at it again with the
White vans you can't lie man I got a lot
Of white fares could I get a ultralight
Beam maybe by chance every day I've been
Switching up on my stairs scare
Everyone away whenever I dance people in
A comment saying that I can't rap okay
Cuz I didn't understand that fuck you
Man I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sitting getting in a wait like
A sandbag if you want to talk trash say
It to my face
I'll be singing ""lala"", I got to a lay
I'll be like a haha at the human race
Ham in a lead not far from a newer place
Getting sick over and sicker the flow on
The track in and quick over and quicker
Shiver me timbers I'm winning these
Bigger kill evicted not swiping left

Rapids is a bad fight

Mad sight hey to see changing their
Opinions is that right hey, hey, hey I'm

Battery pack that a blackberry add on a
Stack of his tab revving as the bath of

Train of thought right back on the track

Brick By Boring BrickParamore,"[Verse 1]
She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure
The lens I told her
The angles were all wrong now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

[Chorus]
Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

Ba-da-ba, ba-da ba-ba-ba

[Verse 2]
So one day he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve
Well, make sure to build your house brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

[Chorus]
Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic

[Verse 3]
If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
Then you can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah

[Chorus]
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
(You'll be better off without me now)
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

CousinsVampire Weekend,"[Verse 1]
You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and the smart ones sit outside of their sight
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night
Dad was a risk-taker, his was a shoe maker
You, ""Greatest Hits 2006"" little list-maker
Heard codes in the melodies, you heeded the call
Oh, you were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all

[Verse 2]
Interesting colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty, you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birthright is interest, you could just accrue it all

[Chorus]
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

[Bridge]
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins

Mountain ManCrash Kings,"I'm sittin' on top of a mountain
She's rockin' that valley down below
Switch back to the peak with the blindfold
Bummin' down at the top of my lungs
Screaming no
Straight out on a headwall, oh
Turned into a free fall

I'm sipping on some sunshine
I'm gonna leave it for the morning in the afterlife
And she's drunk by the daytime
I bet she feels it just the same in the evening
I'm sipping on some sunshine
I'm gonna leave it for the morning in the afterlife
And she's drunk by the daytime
I bet she feels it just the same not anymore

I'm sittin' on top of a hillside
There's a one-way path that's a-takin' me home
Climbing up to the peak with the blindfold
Bummin' down at the top of my lungs
Screaming no
Straight out on a headwall, oh
Turned into a free fall

I'm sipping on some sunshine

LisztomaniaPhoenix,"[Verse 1]
So sentimental
Not sentimental, no
Romantic, not disgusting yet
Darling, I'm down and lonely
When with the fortunate only
I've been looking for something else
Do let, do let, do let
Jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
Distant from other interests
On your favorite weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
That's with the fortunate only
No, I gotta be someone else
These days, it comes, it comes, it comes
It comes, it comes and goes

Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses

Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses

Follow, misguide, stand still
Disgust, discourage
On this precious weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely
Do let, do let, do let
Jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
We'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over, we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days, it comes, it comes, it comes
It comes, it comes and goes

Wanna pack your bags, something small
Take what you need and we'll disappear
Without a trace, we'll be gone, gone
The moon and the stars will follow the car
And then, when we get out to the ocean
We're gonna take a boat to the end of the world
All the way to the end of the world

Oh, and when the kids are old enough
We're gonna teach them to fly

Eyes closed, we're gonna spin through the stars
Our arms wide as the sky
We gonna ride the blue all the way to the end of the world
To the end of the world

We can always look back at what we did
Always the memory of you and me, baby
But right now it's you and me forever, girl
And you know we could do better than anything that we did
You know that you and me, we could do anything

[Chorus]
You and me together
We could do anything, baby
You and me together, yeah, yeah
Two of us together
We could do anything, baby
You and me together, yeah, yeah
Two of us together
Yeah, yeah
Two of us together
We could do anything, baby

Until we reach the end of the world"
Sweet DispositionThe Temper Trap,"[Verse 1]
Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you

[Pre-Chorus]
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A moment, a love, a dream aloud

So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

Heartbreak WarfareJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

Verse [2]
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

[Verse 3]
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all

[Bridge]
It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God, we're going to get it right
If you lay your weapon down

Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak

Cryin' Like A Bitch!Godsmack,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Strut on by like a king
Telling everybody they know nothing
Long lived: what you thought you were
Time ain't on your side anymore

[Chorus 1]
And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch

[Verse 2]
I'm tougher than nails, I can promise you that
Step outta line and you'll get bitch-slapped back
And you can run your little mouth all day
But the hand of God just smacked you back into yesterday

[Chorus 2]
And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denying you were cryin' like a bitch

[Bridge]
Blinded by your sacred faded past times, only time is your enemy
Granted a second chance to prove that your arrogance is
Stronger than you'll ever be… it's stronger than you can be

And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you

You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch

The only thing that's been on my mind
Is the one thing I need before I die

Little SmirkTheory Of A Deadman,"[Intro]
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then I've got a story to tell
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I guess you're going straight to hell!

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna leave you now or never
'Cause we're perfect together
Never wanna be apart
Dared to take on the simple life

There was trouble for us when I came home early
Never would expect to see this
It's fair to say I could not believe my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say
So I made a list of how you're going to pay

[Chorus]
I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can
'Cause, I took your car
With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby, now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk

[Verse 2]
Now I feel better
But it's hard to forget
I never think of looking back
'Cause time has no meaning when you're free
This is what you get
Karma, bitch
Now I see who you really are
'Cause happiness is the best revenge

[Pre-Chorus]
But caught red handed with a grin on your face
Didn't think you'd be easy to replace

[Chorus]
I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can
'Cause, I took your car
With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby, now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk

[Bridge]
Again and again and again and again and e-yeah....
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then I've got a story to tell
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I know I'm going straight to hell

[Chorus]
I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can
'Cause, I took your car
With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby, now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk

Lay Me DownThe Dirty Heads,"Woah.. Woah.. Woah.. na.. na.. Ooohhooo..
Woah.. Woah.. Woah.. na.. na.. Ooohhooo..

[Verse 1: Duddy B]
Well this is how it starts
Two lovers in the dark
On the run from the one
That they called Sheriff Spark
Six guns by their side
And bullets around their waist
Two shots to the sky
Signal sound for the chase
The safe was nearly empty
And they were nearly free
But were seen by the good eye
Of the mean Billy Green
And he screamed at the top of his lungs
They're on the run
It's the two outsiders
Grab your horses and your guns

[Chorus: Rome]
I said I wish that we could stay here
But I fear our time has come
We could ride out in the darkness
Chasing the rising sun
We gotta pack our bags this instant
We're heading south-bound to the next town
And if we all arrive there so safely
Baby, you can lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

[Verse 2: Dirty J]
Well it's the story of the two
Always on the move
They got nothing left to lose
'Cept their guns and their wounds
Now they're crossing borders
Sheriff's posse on their tail
They'd rather die together
Than be stuck up in a cell
They drank up all the whiskey
And they partied every night
Like it could be the last
The bounty said shoot on sight
So they chased the endless summer
Knew it came with the pride
They wouldn't stop running
'Til they found their paradise
But the sheriff finally found them
With his eyes seeing red
So the lovers had to shoot him down
And fill him full of lead
They were finally free
To find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did
He looked at her and then he said

[Chorus 2: Rome]
I said I think that we can stay here
Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely
Baby, you can lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

[Verse 3: Dirty J]
Well you're my green-eyed girl
And I've been running around with you
It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do
So wipe the dirt off
Or take your shirt off
And we should go hit the cantina
We got work off
I said it's hot outside
Let me go swimming in your eyes
We've been running for a while
Why don't you lay down and make smile
I could never ask for nothing better than this
It's just tequila and the beach
That's why it's salty when we kiss

[Chorus 2: Rome]
I said I think that we can stay here
Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely
Baby you can lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down, no
Lay me down
Lay me down"
I'm Your DaddyWeezer,"[Verse 1]
I thought tonight would suck like every other night
I'd party with my friends
But when I saw you grooving on the dance floor
Normal came to an end
We started talking and man, it was so clear to me
There's no one else like you
You got the brains, the body, and the beauty
To top it off, you're cool

[Chorus]
This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy

[Verse 2]
I hope that I ain't freaking you out
You probably hear it all the time
I swear I ain't like those other boys
I'm a special kind
I would like to give a demonstration
Of what it is I do
I'll take you out to dinner at Palermo's
We'll split a cheese fondue

[Chorus]
This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy

[Verse 3]
I will ape the goomba
If you tire
Try my best to moonwalk
On the wire
I just want to, ooh ah
Feel your fire
Feel your fire
Feel your fire!

[Chorus]
This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy"
The High RoadBroken Bells,"[Verse 1]
We're bound to wait all night
She's bound to run amok
Invested enough in it anyhow
And to each his own
The garden is sorting out
She curls her lips on a barrel
""I don't know if you're dead or not
If you're anyone""

[Pre-Hook]
Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many heads, to analyze
Come on and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And they want to get up in your head

[Hook]
Cause they know and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour in your new life
Tell all of your friends goodbye

[Verse 2]
The dawn to end all nights
That's all we hoped it was
A break from the warfare in your house
But to each his own
A soldier is bailing out
And curled his lips on the barrel
And I don't know if the dead can talk, to anyone

[Pre-Hook]
Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many heads, are you one of us?
Come on and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And they want to get up in your head

[Hook]
Cause they know and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour in your new life
Tell all of your friends goodbye

It's too late to change your mind
You've let loss be your guide
It's too late to change your mind

It's too late to change your mind
You've let loss be your guide
It's too late to change your mind
You've let loss be your guide"
Jesus Stole My GirlfriendViolent Soho,"[Verse 1]
Every day, every afternoon
Tried so hard
But lost to God
I thought you're my friend
I'll guess again
I look to the clouds
God gives me a frown

[Chorus]
This time next year
I'll be married
This time next year
I'll say sorry

Jesus stole my girlfriend
Jesus stole my girlfriend

A smile and a wink
Meant more than a kiss
But I don't see the world
Like you do girl
We ate and we sung
To glory and fun
But Jesus is here
He ate up our fears

Rise UpCypress Hill,"[Speaker]
Since  the Watts riot of 1965 has the city seemed so out of control. Los Angeles is still on the edge

[B-Real]
Living in the big city
The American dream
Is far roaming in the streets of greed
Everywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more
But I ain't selling my soul
With the dope theres no girl
I'm on a one way box to the top
Hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block
I'm in the fast lane and I won't stop
You ain't nothing but talk
You couldn't hang on the rope by ball

[Sen Dog]
This life that I live
It ain't for the weak
Got my roddy gangster that came off the street
I'm trying to keep the peace
But I gotta keep my pace
Got these drunk police
Want me all rappy
And I'm searching for the higher ground
I want my head in the sky
So high that I can't come down
Leave your lies in every town across the nation
Cause you can never stop to play

[Hook]
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)

So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground
Rise Up (Rise Up)

Cruising in the drop chevy
Got my foot on the floor
I'm hitting switches and my brim is heavy
You wanna look inside
And see whos crossing the brine
Curiosity is killing you
With stick in the prime
I get high from the brim in the set
Never gripping the square
But all you haters couldn't hold my
Don't need a clip for my ? straight
You should leave it alone
And check your toe cause my line will spit

[Sen Dog]
This right heres as high as it gets
Somebody likes it..the hell
Cause you stepped on the sex
But guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check
Got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets
You came, for me I'm the best
And you can keep the dress
Cause I'm smoke at the less
Turn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed

Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)

I go psycho, crazy Michael Myers
Except the stages on fire going higher
Cause when I lean on a flyer
Theres so much more to make the whole city rise
This defines a man to get the whole world lifted
Wall man trying to make a land with a mission
There's no way you can stand in this position
You can't take the heat get the fuck about the tension

[B-Real]
Go with the will to hustle, you see if we hit the floor
You'll never stop it you ain't got the muscle
Were going to world top, homeboy this is the show
We gotta blow up the stage be out the door
Sometimes we all nedd an escape
So when we form our track
Well get your mind while we get the stat
I made a pack with a crew on the hill
We continue to build with all the people who believe their bill

We are ready for the siege
We are armed up to the teeth
Be careful how you live and breathe
Release what's broken underneath

[Chorus]
How many times do you wanna die?
How many ways do you wanna die?
To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Very carefully look over your shoulder

We can laugh about it now
But we hope everything works out
Be careful how you lick your wounds
Believe that change is coming soon

How many times do you want to die?
How many ways do you want to die?
To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Very carefully look over your shoulder

You used to do a little, but a little won't fly
Right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time

[Bridge]
Can it please you still?
Were you named in your father's will?
Or does it make you ill?
Let us bruise their knees
We will aim straight for the feet
You will be relieved, so relieved, so relieved
To your full desire
Feel the sparks of the friendly fire
Misery inspires
Your throat has been cut several times before
Never noticed the size of the flow
It can't be ignored

[Chorus]
To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Carefully look over your shoulder

[Post-Chorus]
You said you believe it, but believing won't fly
Right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time

And when it's all over and you open your eyes
You'll see the room turned on its side
And you'll be lying by a note on the floor, signed:

The royal we

Skinny little bitch, staring at the mirror
In your desperation to disappear
And you would be oh, so dumb to fuck with me
'Cause, baby, you're much too young to end up with me

And everyone can see you now
Your bedroom walls, they sell for cheap
You lie, you lie alone
You lie alone, you never sleep

Praying for some salvation 'cause she’s oh so bored
In my vile sex horror and my cheap drugs hell
And all the things you'll never live to tell

[Chorus]
And you will never see the light
I'll just obscure it out of spite
Just a nasty piece of work
Come on, come on, baby
Come on, baby, let it burn
Oh baby, does it hurt?

[Bridge]
Born of foul creation
Born of sour milk, cocaine filth

[Chorus]
You staggered here on broken glass
So I could kick your scrawny ass
All the drugs and all the burns
What a nasty, what a nasty, nasty piece of work
Oh baby, does it hurt?
Oh baby, just go slower
Oh baby, just go lower

[Outro]
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch

Lovely disguise
Read between the lines
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation
Three

You sell what you bought
And there ain't no magic pen
To get back what you lost

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take

Penguins don't fly
Crocodile Sunday smile
Really love to fish
But don't like superficial people
Shoe store
Heard it all before
From pearly whites to pearly gates
What do we have to argue 'bout?

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take

Leave me all alone before
Get out the way
Never did what she was told
Get out the way
Seems to play at time of war
Get out the way
Less is big and listens more

KandiOne eskimO,"You've been my queen for longer than you know
My love for you has been
Every step I take, every day I live, everything I see

And if I get things wrong
Don't want you to think that I'm running away
But I heard from Jo about this guy and I want to know

What did he say?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he do?
He called me baby, baby, all night long

Why? Why? Why did you need him? Where was I?
Just how close to you is he?
Every smile you gave, every touch you made, every word you said

And it hurts beyond hurt
It was a love that blinds and a love that stings
When I heard from Jo about this guy and I want to know

What did he say?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he do?
He called me baby, baby, all night long

What did he say?
He called me baby, baby, all night long

Does my love ever touch you?
Does my love ever reach you?
It's never enough, ah, is it never enough?

He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he do?
He called me baby, baby, all night long

What did he say?
He called me baby, baby, all night long
What did he do?
He called me baby, baby, all night long

I know he called you, baby, baby, all night long
I know he called you, baby, baby, all night long"

Oh, Stylo (juice)
Go for blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (it's the giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes (as it leaps from the stream)
Then I'll know the twilight skies (blood curdles, it's a death throw)
Are not so broken hearted (hot from the end of the line)

Letters From The SkyCivil Twilight,"One of these days the sky's gonna break
And everything will escape and I'll know
One of these days the mountains
Are gonna fall into the sea and they'll know

That you and I were made for this
I was made to taste your kiss
We were made to never fall away
Never fall away

One of these days letters are gonna fall
From the sky telling us all to go free
But until that day I'll find a way
To let everybody know that you're coming back
You're coming back for me

Cause even though you left me here
I have nothing left to fear
These are only walls that hold me here
Hold me here, hold me here, hold me here
Only walls that hold me here

One day soon I'll hold you like the sun holds the moon
And we will hear those planes overhead
And we won't have to be scared
Cause we won't have to be scared
We won't have to be, yeah, scared, no

White Flag WarriorFlobots,"[Intro: Jonny 5]
We request to negotiate
We come to you unarmed
We desire to communicate
You cannot do us harm

[Verse 1: Jonny 5]
They want sacrifice
They have schemes and ask me to follow their path to the afterlife
I've got an appetite
For nice things and pipe dreams that my enemies could be blasted by
Ooh metaphors
Views that are better for you can't survive or find your competitor
Rise together
Or Fight separate wars I pray I'm never forced to be a predator

[Brer Rabbit]
Spectres spectate
We won't last
They're glad to hate
When gladiators
Breathe their last
Scream en masse
When the dreams do clash
Like swords in the war
Let me bleed on that
But they feed on that
Say we need strong backs
Call us weak
And don't redeem contracts
But the feast won't last
When this beast attacks
The sons and the fathers
Will be free at last

[Pre-Chorus: Jonny 5 (Tim McIlrath)]
(This is love, it's not treason)(x4)

They see sharks in the estuary
They claim the ark is Bartholomew's
They say war is necessary
But we say war is child abuse

[Chorus: Tim McIlrath (Jonny 5)]
We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

[Verse 2: Brer Rabbit]
Core-to-core
Were the one's we've been waiting for
We hold steady
Steadier than stevedores
Not tevias or matadors
On matters of what came before
Forgive the debts
And settle scores
And test the mettle
Either/or
What's your plan go to do with me?
If the bell tolls, let freedom ring
And find the new ways if we must be king
Instead of leading the young to our suffering

[Jonny 5]
We pass testaments down scream back at heaven
For testing us like Wednesday's at 11
Want to recruit and train us to act evilly
Save it for the shooting range
And smack DVDs
Won't study war no more this millennium
It's never again for me or anyone
So think harder when you refer to us
Rather make our children martyrs than murders

[Pre-Chorus: Jonny 5 (Tim McIlrath)]
(This is love, this is not treason)x4

They shell dwellings to quell the shellings (This is love)
And lift taboos to seduce the cowards (This is not treason)
They say we're too yellow bellied (This is love)
But we say we're the new superpower (This is not treason)

[Chorus: Tim McIlrath (Jonny 5)]
We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)

We seek ways to not be liable (This is love)
We claim to speak for a higher truth (This is not treason)
We stand opposed to the homicidal (This is love)
We tell you you are fire proof (This is not treason)

We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)

UnravelingSevendust,"Verse 1
I need an answer, some way to understand
This feels so convincing and a little out of hand
So tell me one thing who gave you all those scars?
That took away your innocence
You push away with everything you are, I can't take this anymore

Chorus
I'm tired of breaking, I'm tired of faking
I want the world to see you sold a broken dream
You were not there for me, I was unraveling
All that we never knew that could've been me and you
But you took everything, now it's just you unraveling

Verse 2
So here we are now, break what's already broken
I guess I could've seen this coming if you'd been around
Let's tear the past wide open, I can't take this anymore

Chorus
I'm tired of breaking, I'm tired of faking
I want the world to see you sold a broken dream
You were not there for me, I was unraveling
All that we never knew that could've been me and you
But you took everything, now it's just you unraveling

Verse 3
What have we become? The hopeless dramatic
I think it's over
We hope to find the truth still breathing
Can we survive the low?

I want the world to see you sold a broken dream
You were not there for me, I was unraveling

Outro
I want the world to see you sold a broken dream
You were not there for me, I was unraveling
All that we never knew that could've been me and you
But you took everything, now it's just you unraveling"
You And Your HeartJack Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Watch you when you say
What you are and when you blame everyone
You broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

[Chorus]
But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

[Verse 2]
You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

[Chorus]
But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

Oh, and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard?

[Verse 3]
You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How are you going to scratch any backs?
Better hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines and

[Outro]
Hope the tide will take our lines and
Hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines away"
Let Me Hear You ScreamOzzy Osbourne,"[Intro]
Let me hear you scream!

[Verse 1]
I'm black and bruised, beat up, but still I take the blows
Because all I need is blood and sweat and skin and bones
I'll take this rage, rattle your cage, nobody said it's easy
It's do or die, only the strong survive, get ready for the last stand
Get ready, I'm your hangman

Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it
If you're going to go down, go loud, go strong
Go proud, go on, go hard or go home
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream

[Verse 2]
I'll pull you up and push you right back in your place
I'll take you down and wipe that smile right off your face
I'll watch you break your mine to take, don't blink; you just might miss it
It's all or nothing, nowhere left to run, are you ready for the last fight
Get ready with the war cry

[Chorus]
Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it
If you're going to go down, go loud, go strong

And the needle breaks
Come run away with me
Come on, you'll see

The Crow & The ButterflyShinedown,"[Verse 1]
I painted your room at midnight
So I'd know yesterday was over
I put all your books on the top shelf
Even the one with the four leaf clover
Man, I'm getting older

[Verse 2]
I took all your pictures off the wall
And wrapped them in a newspaper blanket
I haven't slept in what seems like a century
And now I can barely breathe

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late

[Verse 3]
Your words still serenade me
Your lullabies won't let me sleep
I've never heard such a haunting melody
Oh, it's killing me
You know I can barely breathe

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away

Like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away

In One EarCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
They say that we ain't got the style, we ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's gonna put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise, tryna make the radio
I'm an antisocial anarchist who sound like so-and-so
They say I'm just a stupid kid, another crazy radical
Rock 'n' roll is dead, I probably should have stayed at school
Another Generation X who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh, they'd love to see me fall, but I'm already on my back

[Chorus]
So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

[Verse 2]
Now I know I'm not a saint, I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws, I'd rather keep them in the light
They want to criticize, scrutinize, cast another stone
Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from their throne
They say the devil is my pal, I do a lot of drugs
The crowd will only like me if they're really fucking drunk
They think they know my thoughts, but they don't know the least
If they'd listen to the words they'd find a message tucked beneath

[Chorus]
But it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit even though they never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

[Bridge]
You hear that? You hear what's coming?
Oh, you better run for the hills
Cause we're coming to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down

[Verse 3]
Here's the moral to the story: we don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money, we don't do it for the fame
So all the critics who despise us, go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us, adds the fire to our flames

[Outro]
And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit so you know we never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
I'm only playing music cause you know I fucking love it
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand"

Am I going insane?
My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling attacks (attacks)
My body's shaking, there's no turning back
Don't take your eyes off the trigger!

Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding as I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames

You said that we'd be forever!
How could you kill me and lie to my face?
Now that we can't be together!
There's just no hope for our final embrace

So here we are
I'm in your head
I'm in your heart!

With the horses that you ride
And the feelings left inside
Comes a time you need to leave all that behind
Well they claim they'd like to know
Anyone could let it go
And the people gather 'round for the last show

[Chorus]
Well there is a reward
To live and die by the sword
Well they tried to complicate you
But you left it all behind
All worldly possessions
Are left for recollection
And finally it's all gone

They're releasing all the hounds
What is lost can still be found
When you hop up off your feet, you're on the ground
Well there's some who choose to run
Following the setting sun
And now it seems the journey has begun

Another Way To DieDisturbed,"[Intro]
The indulgence of our lives has cast a shadow on our world
Our devotion to our appetites betrayed us all
An apocalyptic plight
More destruction will unfold
Mother Earth will show her darker side and take her toll

[Verse 1]
It's just another way to die
There can be no other reason why
You know we should have seen it coming
Consequences we cannot deny will be revealed in time
Glaciers melt as we pollute the sky
A sign of devastation coming
We don’t need another way to die
Can we repent in time?

[Pre-Chorus]
The time bomb is ticking and no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?

[Chorus]
Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die
Ooh, can we repent in time?

[Verse 2]
Greed and hunger led to our demise
A path I can't believe we followed
Black agenda's rooted in a lie
Will we repent in time?
Species fall before our very eyes
A world that they cannot survive in left them with another way to die
Are we dead inside?

[Pre-Chorus]
The time bomb is ticking and no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?

[Chorus]
Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die

Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved

NightmareAvenged Sevenfold,"[Intro]
Nightmare!
Now your nightmare comes to life

[Verse 1]
Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever (Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed (Burn the world your last endeavor)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life

[Verse 2]
Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason (Loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Fight (Fight!), not to fail (Fail!), not to fall (Fall!)
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (Die!), die again (Die!), drenched in sin (Sin!)
With no respect for another, oh!
Down (Down!), feel the fire (Fire!), feel the hate (Hate!)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!), hit the wall (Wall!), watch you crawl (Crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare"

My Best TheoryJimmy Eat World,"[Verse 1]
It's been a long time, so long
There's only one life I know (I know)
But I have my own mind
I'll say so if it seems right (air rush out)
I see your warm face with the soft mouth
But it speaks something else (else)
I'll take my chances with the cast down
We can feel the air...

[Chorus]
Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me
In me

[Break]
(We can feel, we can feel the air rush out)

[Verse 3]
So many questions
And the answers come back unanswered
Let's hold the old script
It's a new twist
You can feel the air...

[Chorus]
Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me

In a lonely, real place
Neither part nor mistake
Love what you have with your time
By dousing, find my true desire
My threat, my appetite

(My true desire)

I feel the air...

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?

Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me

Lesson LearnedAlice In Chains,"[Verse 1]
Just another lesson learned
Wear a scar, a bore repeating
Take a simple fateful turn
Opened up to stop the bleeding

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

[Chorus]
Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

[Verse 2]
Just another brick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

[Chorus]
Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold

You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
Just another lesson learned

Kick In The TeethPapa Roach,"[Verse 1]
We live in a cold dark world with venom in it's fangs
You can spit it in my face but I know I'll be okay

A ball and chain, chew my arm off to get away
Don't fight it
Or deny it
Invite it

CrossfireBrandon Flowers,"[Verse 1]

You're keeping secrets on your pillow
Let me inside, no cause for alarm
I promise tonight not to do no harm
I promise you, baby, I won't do you no harm

Of heaven and hell
And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down
Lay your body down

I forget all about the storm outside
Dark clouds roll their way over town
Heartache and pain came a-pouring down
Like hail, sleet and rain, yeah
They're handing it out

And we're caught up in the crossfire
Of Heaven and Hell
And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down

His fiery arrows drew their bead in vain
And when the hardest part is over we'll be here
And our dreams will break the boundaries of our fears
Boundaries of our fears

Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down

You make my teeth clench and my hands shake
Do you ever see what you do to me?
Wearing me out, just wearing me out
But I'm wearing you down

You're impossible to love or leave
So impossible to win or please
I'm wearing you out, just wearing you out

It means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive; harder to forget

Try to think through what I can do to you
It's wearing me thin
Can I begin to wear you out?

Not so easy to forgive; harder to forget

The Sound (John M. Perkins' Blues)Switchfoot,"[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1]
The static comes in slow
You can feel it grow
Our stream of conscience flows
Under the streets below
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
The rivers made of sound
Still running underground
Runs like a silent flood
We run as thick as blood

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Can you hear it rise
Up from the ground?
Can't drown it out
Can you hear it now?

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our own collisions
We are the voice of breaking down

[Verse 3]
The static comes alive
Beneath the broken skies
John Perkins said it right
""Love is the final fight""
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let it rise above
Rise above
There is no song
Louder than love

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our own collisions
We are the voice of breaking down
Down!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let it rise above
Up from the ground
Can't drown it out
Can you hear it now?

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our fallen condition
We are the voice of breaking down

This is the sound, this is the sound"
End Of MeApocalyptica,"Rosaries left under the mattress
All those memories who could bear the witness
As you slip into oblivion, use it like a weapon
Am I left to bleed waiting for the moment when you've had your fun
A loaded gun

Take away your broken misery, I can't always erase your memory
This love, this love is gonna be the end of me
Everything I gave is wasted, I'm the one who's suffocated
This love, this love is gonna be the end of

Can't resist poisoning the message
Just a narcissist trapped inside the wreckage
And the sympathy I had is gone deadened by the ceremony
Drama queen stand behind your rampart as your kingdom falls all because

Take away your broken misery, I can't always erase your memory
This love, this love is gonna be the end of me
Everything I gave is wasted, I'm the one who suffocated
This love, this love is gonna be the end of me

Your rescue, my undo
I'm not the one to save you
I'm empty completely
I'm drowning in your shadow

Take away your broken misery, I can't always erase your memory
This love, this love is gonna be the end of me
Everything I gave is wasted, I'm the one who suffocated
This love, this love is gonna be the end of

Can't chase away your ghost, inside it only grows
Nothing left but misery
This will be the end of me
All the shit that you created, all the scars you celebrated
Couldn't take away your pain
Couldn't resurrect your gain
This love will be the end of me, this love will be the end"
Living In A DreamFinger Eleven,"I was never the kind
To be taking my time
Any place that's worth a damn
And today's another day
That I've gone and thrown away
And I don't care where it lands

'Cause I'm just thinking about us
I've been living in a dream about you
And now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind
And if I never see
My own reality
Well, I'm okay to leave it all behind

I'll be gone for a time
Tuning out for a while
It's gonna look like I'm not all there
I've decided that today
Seems alright to piss away
Ignore my empty stare

'Cause I'm just thinking about us
I've been living in a dream about you
And now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind
And if I never see
My own reality
Well, I'm okay to leave it all behind

When I come down
And look around
I can't believe
The fantasy is gone like a memory
Out of my reach
Fading out from me
You're fading out from me

I've been living in a dream about you
And now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind
And if I never see
My own reality
Well, I'm okay to leave it all behind"

Listening to techno music on the bus while we earned our checks

I can hear them babies crying and the lawn needs to be mowed
I got to get my groove on because I'm freaking bored!

[Chorus]
Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again"
Beg Steal Or BorrowRay Lamontagne And The Pariah Dogs,"So your hometown's bringin' you down
Are you drownin' in the small talk and the chatter?
Are you gonna step into line like your daddy done?
Punchin' the time and climbing life's long ladder

You've been howlin' at the moon like a slack-jawed fool
And breaking every rule they can throw on
Well, one of these days is gonna be right soon
You'll find your legs and go and stay gone

Young man, full of big plans
And thinkin' about tomorrow
Young man, gonna make a stand
You beg, you steal, you borrow
You beg, you steal, you borrow

Pull all the friends that you knew in school
They used to be so cool, now they just bore you
Well look at 'em now, already pullin' the plow
So quick to take to grain like some old mule

Young man, full of big plans
And thinkin' about tomorrow
Young man, gonna make a stand
You beg, you steal, you borrow
You beg, you steal, you borrow

Dreamin' of the day you're gonna pack your bags
Put the miles away
Oh, just grab your girl and go where no one knows you
What will all the old folks say?

So the hometown's bringin' you down
Are you drownin' in the small talk and the chatter?
Are you gonna step into line like your daddy done?
Punchin' the time and climbing life's long ladder

Young man, full of big plans
And thinkin' about tomorrow
Young man, gonna make a stand
You beg, you steal, you borrow
You beg, you steal, you borrow"
Life Won't WaitOzzy Osbourne,"[Verse 1]
I watch it all change
Take the news of the day
And throw it away
Time will kill all the pain
Faith will cure the decay
Of all this blind ambition
The greed brings us together
Stay strong, stay true, be brave - it all comes down to you

[Verse 2]
Tried to just let it go
Know that justice moves slow
But it comes in the end
Rise the guilty will fall
Stay they can't take it all
They want the unimportant
It's love they leave behind
Stand up, stay true, be hard - the future looks to you

[Verse 3]
Every second you throw away
Every minute of every day
Don't get caught in a myriad
Because life won't wait for you
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

[Verse 4]
I'm watching the change
Through who will carry the flame
It all feels very strange
Dreams than mean can be good
Faith - to live as we should
And know we're all connected
We give ourselves the power
Stay strong stay true be brave - it all comes down to you

[Verse 5]
Every day that you wait you're falling faster
No sleight of hand, no twist of fate, no ever after
When it's gone - it's gone, a fight to the bitter end
Life won't wait for you
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

[Outro]
Life won't wait for you, my friend [x4]"
Shameful MetaphorsChevelle,"[Verse 1]
Fear, it's all the same
Should I evolve to tend to these sights
Said out loud then said again
If fate's so wrong you start to feel light-headed
By my admission nothing grows
Just a longer list of unsorted laws

[Chorus]
So why then has all my life made no sound?
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing

[Verse 2]
Revolting man, this sacred chain
Brought down to trial
No better man could fail the way
You needed all, keep close the vein of empty thoughts
The finest river, the ravens tend
All along insisting, we're worlds away

[Chorus]
So why then has all my life made no sound?
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing

[Bridge]
Behold the lost
Behold a Band-Aid
Behold the lost
Behold a Band-Aid

These shameful metaphors
Fought it through the teeth
Shameful metaphors
Biting at your heels
Shameful metaphors
Fought it cheek to cheek

[Chorus]
So why then has all my life made no sound?
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing"
Take Back The FearHail the Villain,"What I believe is all that I am
Take it away, I'm only a man
Back from the dead and now it appears
I'll be the one to take back the fear

Kill or be killed, that isn't me
Maybe it's you dying to be
Somebody else. Man of the year
But I am the one to take back the fear

(chorus)
Don't want anything taken away
(Someone, anyone)
Taken away from me
It's all that I believe

Message of hate, fading away
My love and my failures ""one in the same""
Now that I'm back, painfully clear
But I'll be the one to take back the fear

(Chorus x2)
When it seems that everything was all a dream
Everything's not what it seems
Even I cannot believe in me easily"

A dustman nocknamed Seven — churches in the employ of Messrs Achburn, Soulpetre and Ashreborn, prairmakers, Glintalook, was asked by the sisterhood the vexed question during his midday collation of leaver and buckrom alternatively with stenk and kitteney phie in a hash-housh and, thankeaven, responsed impulsively: We have just been propogandering his nullity suit and what they took out of his ear among my own crush. All our fellows at O’Dea’s sages with Aratar Calaman he is a cemented brick, buck it all! A more nor usually sober cardriver, who was jauntingly hosing his runabout, Ginger Jane, took a strong view. Lorry hosed her as he talked and this is what he told rewritemen: Irewaker is just a plain pink joint reformee in private life but folks all have it by brehemons laws he has parliamentary honours. Eiskaffier said (Louigi’s, you know that man’s, brillant Savourain): Mon foie, you wish to ave some homelette, yes, lady! Good, mein leber! Your hegg he must break himself See, I crack, so, he sit in the poele, umbedimbt! A perspirer (over sixty) who was keeping up his tennises panted he kne ho har twa to clect infamatios but a diffpair flannels climb wall and trespassing on doorbell. After fullblown Braddon hear this fresky troterella! A railways barmaid’s view (they call her Spilltears Rue) was thus expressed: to sympathisers of the Dole Line, Death Avenue, anent those objects of her pity-prompted ministrance, to wet, man and his syphon. Ehim! It is ever too late to whissle when Phyllis floods her stable. It would be skar-lot shame to jailahim in lockup, as was proposed to him by the Seddoms creature what matter what merrytricks went off with his revulverher in connections with ehim being a norphan and enjoining such wicked illth, ehim! Well done, Drumcollakill! Kitty Tyrrel is proud of you, was the reply of a B.O.T. official (O blame gnot the board!) while the Daughters Benkletter mur-mured in uniswoon: Golforgilhisjurylegs! Brian Lynsky, the cub curser, was questioned at his shouting box, Bawlonabraggat, and gave a snappy comeback, when saying: Paw! Once more I’ll hellbowl! I am for caveman chase and sahara sex, burk you! Them two bitches ought to be leashed, canem! Up hog and hoar hunt! Paw! A wouldbe martyr, who is attending on sanit Asitas where he is being taught to wear bracelets, when grilled on the point, revealed the undoubted fact that the consequence would be that so long as Sankya Moondy played his mango tricks under the mysttetry, with shady apsaras sheltering in his leaves’ licence and his shadowers torrifried by the potent bolts of indradiction, there would be fights all over Cuxhaven. (Tosh!) Missioner Ida Womb-well, the seventeenyearold revivalist, said concerning the coinci — dent of interfizzing with grenadines and other respectable and disgusted peersons using the park: That perpendicular person is a brut! But a magnificent brut! ‘Caligula’ (Mr Danl Magrath, bookmaker, wellknown to Eastrailian poorusers of the Sydney Parade Ballotin) was, as usual, antipodal with his: striving todie, hopening tomellow, Ware Splash. Cobbler. We have meat two hourly, sang out El Caplan Buycout, with the famous padre’s turridur’s capecast, meet too ourly, matadear! Dan Meiklejohn, precentor, of S.S. Smack and Olley’s was probiverbal with his upsiduxit: mutatus mutandus. Dauran’s lord (‘Sniffpox’) and Moir-gan’s lady (‘Flatterfun’) took sides and crossed and bowed to each other’s views and recrossed themselves. The dirty dubs upin their flies, went too free, echoed the dainly drabs downin their scenities, una mona. Sylvia Silence, the girl detective (Meminerva, but by now one hears turtlings all over Doveland!) when supplied with informations as to the several facets of the case in her cozy-dozy bachelure’s flat, quite overlooking John a’Dream’s mews, leaned back in her really truly easy chair to query restfully through her vowelthreaded syllabelles: Have you evew thought, wepow-tew, that sheew gweatness was his twadgedy? Nevewtheless ac — cowding to my considewed attitudes fow this act he should pay the full penalty, pending puwsuance, as pew Subsec. 32, section II, of the C. L.

Jarley Jilke began to silke for he couldn’t get home to Jelsey but ended with: He’s got the sack that helped him moult instench of his gladsome rags. Meagher, a naval rating, seated on one of the granite cromlech setts of our new fish-shambles for the usual aireating after the ever popular act, with whom were Questa and Puella, piquante and quoite, (this had a cold in her brain while that felt a sink in her summock, wit’s wat, wot’s wet) was encouraged, although nearvanashed himself, by one of his co-affianced to get your breath, Walt, and gobbit and when ther chidden by her fastra sastra to saddle up your pance, Naville, thus cor replied to her other’s thankskissing: I lay my two fingerbuttons, fiancee Meagher, (he speaks!) he was to blame about your two velvetthighs up Horniman’s Hill — as hook and eye blame him or any other piscman? — but I also think, Puellywally, by the siege of his trousers there was some-one else behind it — you bet your boughtem blarneys — about their three drummers down Keysars Lane. (Trite!).
Be these meer marchant taylor’s fablings of a race referend with oddman rex? Is now all seenheard then forgotten? Can it was, one is fain in this leaden age of letters now to wit, that so diversified outrages (they have still to come!) were planned and partly carried out against so staunch a covenanter if it be true than any of those recorded ever took place for many, we trow, beyessed to and denayed of, are given to us by some who use the truth but sparingly and we, on this side ought to sorrow for their pricking pens on that account. The seventh city, Urovivla, his citadear of refuge, whither (would we believe the laimen and their counts), beyond the outraved gales of Atreeatic, changing clues with a baggermalster, the hejirite had fled, silentioussue-meant under night’s altosonority, shipalone, a raven of the wave, (be mercy, Mara! A he whence Rahoulas!) from the ostmen’s dirtby on the old vic, to forget in expiating manslaughter and, reberthing in remarriment out of dead seekness to devine previ-dence, (if you are looking for the bilder deep your ear on the movietone!) to league his lot, palm and patte, with a papishee. For mine qvinne I thee giftake and bind my hosenband I thee halter. The wastobe land, a lottuse land, a luctuous land, Emerald-illuim, the peasant pastured, in which by the fourth commandment with promise his days apostolic were to be long by the abundant mercy of Him Which Thundereth From On High, murmured, would rise against him with all which in them were, franchisab-les and inhabitands, astea as agora, helotsphilots, do him hurt, poor jink, ghostly following bodily, as were he made a curse for them, the corruptible lay quick, all saints of incorruption-of-an holy nation, the common or ere-ingarden castaway, in red re-surrection to condemn so they might convince him, first pha — roah, Humpheres Cheops Exarchas, of their proper sins. Busi — ness bred to speak with a stiff upper lip to all men and most occa — sions the Man we wot of took little short of fighting chances but for all that he or his or his care were subjected to the horrors of the premier terror of Errorland. (perorhaps!)

We seem to us (the real Us!) to be reading our Amenti in the sixth sealed chapter of the going forth by black. It was after the show at Wednesbury that one tall man, humping a suspicious parcel, when returning late amid a dense particular on his home way from the second house of the Boore and Burgess Christy Menestrels by the old spot, Roy’s Corner, had a barkiss revolver placed to his faced with the words: you’re shot, major: by an unknowable assailant (masked) against whom he had been jealous over, Lotta Crabtree or Pomona Evlyn. More than that Whenn the Waylayer (not a Lucalizod diocesan or even of the Glenda-lough see, but hailing fro’ the prow of Little Britain), mention — ing in a bytheway that he, the crawsopper, had, in edition to Reade’s cutless centiblade, a loaded Hobson’s which left only twin alternatives as, viceversa, either he would surely shoot her, the aunt, by pistol, (she could be okaysure of that!) or, failing of such, bash in Patch’s blank face beyond recognition, pointedly asked with gaeilish gall wodkar blizzard’s business Thornton had with that Kane’s fender only to be answered by the aggravated assaulted that that that was the snaps for him, Midweeks, to sultry well go and find out if he was showery well able. But how trans-paringly nontrue, gentlewriter! His feet one is not a tall man, not at all, man. No such parson. No such fender. No such lumber. No such race. Was it supposedly in connection with a girls, Myramy Huey or Colores Archer, under Flaggy Bridge (for ann there is but one liv and hir newbridge is her old) or to explode his twelvechamber and force a shrievalty entrance that the heavybuilt Abelbody in a butcherblue blouse from One Life One Suit (a men’s wear store), with a most decisive bottle of single in his possession, seized after dark by the town guard at Haveyou-caught-emerod’s temperance gateway was there in a gate’s way.

Fifthly, how parasoliloquisingly truetoned on his first time of hearing the wretch’s statement that, muttering Irish, he had had had o’gloriously a’lot too much hanguest or hoshoe fine to drink in the House of Blazes, the Parrot in Hell, the Orange Tree, the Glibt, the Sun, the Holy Lamb and, lapse not leashed, in Ramitdown’s ship hotel since the morning moment he could dixtinguish a white thread from a black till the engine of the laws declosed unto Murray and was only falling fillthefluthered up against the gatestone pier which, with the cow’s bonnet a’top o’it, he falsetook for a cattlepillar with purest peaceablest intentions. Yet how lamely hobbles the hoy of his then pseudo-jocax axplanation how, according to his own story, he vas a process server and was merely trying to open zozimus a bottlop stoub by mortially hammering his magnum bonum (the curter the club the sorer the savage) against the bludgey gate for the boots about the swan, Maurice Behan, who hastily into his shoes with nothing his hald barra tinnteack and came down with homp, shtemp and jumphet to the tiltyard from the wastes a’sleep in his obi ohny overclothes or choker, attracted by the norse of guns playing Delandy is cartager on the raglar rock to Dulyn, said war’ prised safe in bed as he dreamed that he’d wealthes in mor-mon halls when wokenp by a fourth loud snore out of his land of byelo while hickstrey’s maws was grazing in the moonlight by hearing hammering on the pandywhank scale emanating from the blind pig and anything like it (oonagh!oonagh!) in the whole history of the Mullingcan Inn he never. This battering babel allower the door and sideposts, he always said, was not in the very remotest like the belzey babble of a bottle of boose which would not rouse him out o’ slumber deep but reminded him loads more of the martiallawsey marses of foreign musi-kants’ instrumongs or the overthrewer to the third last days of Pompery, if anything. And that after this most nooningless knockturn the young reine came down desperate and the old liffopotamus started ploring all over the plains, as mud as she cud be, ruinating all the bouchers’ schurts and the backers’ wischandtugs so that be the chandeleure of the Rejaneyjailey they were all night wasching the walters of, the weltering walters off. Whyte.

Just one moment. A pinch in time of the ideal, musketeers! Alphos, Burkos and Caramis, leave Astrelea for the astrollajerries and for the love of the saunces and the honour of Keavens pike puddywhackback to Pamintul. And roll away the reel world, the reel world, the reel world! And call all your smokeblushes, Snowwhite and Rosered, if you will have the real cream! Now for a strawberry frolic! Filons, filoosh! Cherchons la flamme! Famm-famm! Fammfamm!

Come on, ordinary man with that large big nonobli head, and that blanko berbecked fischial ekksprezzion Machinsky Scapolo-polos, Duzinascu or other. Your machelar’s mutton leg’s getting musclebound from being too pulled. Noah Beery weighed stone thousand one when Hazel was a hen. Now her fat’s falling fast. Therefore, chatbags, why not yours? There are 29 sweet reasons why blossomtime’s the best. Elders fall for green almonds when they’re raised on bruised stone root ginger though it winters on their heads as if auctumned round their waistbands. If you’d had pains in your hairs you wouldn’t look so orgibald. You’d have Colley Macaires on your lump of lead. Now listen, Mr Leer! And stow that sweatyfunnyadams Simper! Take an old geeser who calls on his skirt. Note his sleek hair, so elegant, tableau vivant. He vows her to be his own honeylamb, swears they will be papa pals, by Sam, and share good times way down west in a guaranteed happy lovenest when May moon she shines and they twit twinkle all the night, combing the comet’s tail up right and shooting popguns at the stars. Creampuffs all to dime! Every nice, missymackenzies! For dear old grumpapar, he’s gone on the razzledar, through gazing and crazing and blazing at the stars. Compree! She wants her wardrobe to hear from above by return with cash so as she can buy her Peter Robinson trousseau and cut a dash with Arty, Bert or possibly Charley Chance (who knows?) so tolloll Mr Hunker you’re too dada for me to dance (so off she goes!) and that’s how half the gels in town has got their bottom drars while grumpapar he’s trying to hitch his braces on to his trars. But old grum he’s not so clean dippy between sweet you and yum (not on your life, boy! not in those trousers! not by a large jugful!) for someplace on the sly, where Furphy he isn’t by, old grum has his gel number two (bravevow, our Grum!) and he would like to canoodle her too some part of the time for he is downright fond of his number one but O he’s fair mashed on peaches number two so that if he could only canoodle the two, chivee chivoo, all three would feel genuinely happy, it’s as simple as A. B. C., the two mixers, we mean, with their cherrybum chappy (for he is simply shamming dippy) if they all were afloat in a dreamlifeboat, hugging two by two in his zoo-doo-you-doo, a tofftoff for thee, missymissy for me and howcameyou-e’enso for Farber, in his tippy, upindown dippy, tiptoptippy canoodle, can you? Finny.

Ack, ack, ack. With which clap, trap and soddenment, three to a loaf, our mutual friends the fender and the bottle at the gate seem to be implicitly in the same bateau, so to singen, bearing also several of the earmarks of design, for there is in fact no use in putting a tooth in a snipery of that sort and the amount of all those sort of things which has been going on onceaday in and twiceaday out every other nachtistag among all kinds of pro-miscious individuals at all ages in private homes and reeboos publikiss and allover all and elsewhere throughout secular sequence the country over and overabroad has been particularly stupendous.

But resuming inquiries. Will it ever be next morning the postal unionist’s (officially called carrier’s, Letters Scotch, Limited) strange fate (Fierceendgiddyex he’s hight, d.e., the losel that hucks around missivemaids’ gummibacks) to hand in a huge chain envelope, written in seven divers stages of ink, from blanch-essance to lavandaiette, every pothook and pancrook bespaking the wisherwife, superscribed and subpencilled by yours A Laugh-able Party, with afterwite, S.A.G., to Hyde and Cheek, Eden — berry, Dubblenn, WC? Will whatever will be written in lappish language with inbursts of Maggyer always seem semposed, black looking white and white guarding black, in that siamixed twoa-talk used twist stern swift and jolly roger? Will it bright upon us, nightle, and we plunging to our plight? Well, it might now, mircle, so it light. Always and ever till Cox’s wife, twice Mrs Hahn, pokes her beak into the matter with Owen K. after her, to see whawa smutter after, will this kiribis pouch filled with litterish frag-ments lurk dormant in the paunch of that halpbrother of a herm, a pillarbox?

The coffin, a triumph of the illusionist’s art, at first blench naturally taken for a handharp (it is handwarp to tristinguish jubabe from jabule or either from tubote when all three have just been invened) had been removed from the hardware premises of Oetzmann and Nephew, a noted house of the gonemost west, which in the natural course of all things continues to supply funeral requisites of every needed description. Why needed, though? Indeed needed (wouldn’t you feel like rattanfowl if you hadn’t the oscar!) because the flash brides or bride in their lily boleros one games with at the Nivynubies’ finery ball and your upright grooms that always come right up with you (and by jingo when they do!) what else in this mortal world, now ours, when meet there night, mid their nackt, me there na-ket, made their nought the hour strikes, would bring them right — came back in the flesh, thumbs down, to their orses and their hashes.

To proceed. We might leave that nitrience of oxagiants to take its free of the air and just analectralyse that very chymerical com-bination, the gasbag where the warderworks. And try to pour somour heiterscene up thealmostfere. In the bottled heliose case continuing, Long Lally Tobkids, the special, sporting a fine breast of medals, and a conscientious scripturereader to boot in the brick and tin choorch round the coroner, swore like a Norewheezian tailliur on the stand before the proper functionary that he was up against a right querrshnorrt of a mand in the butcher of the blues who, he guntinued, on last epening after delivering some car-casses mattonchepps and meatjutes on behalf of Messrs Otto Sands and Eastman, Limericked, Victuallers, went and, with his unmitigated astonissment, hickicked at the dun and dorass against all the runes and, when challenged about the pretended hick (it was kickup and down with him) on his solemn by the imputant imputed, said simply: I appop pie oath, Phillyps Captain. You did, as I sostressed before. You are deepknee in error, sir, Madam Tomkins, let me then tell you, replied with a gentlewomanly salaam MackPartland, (the meatman’s family, and the oldest in the world except nick, name.) And Phelps was flayful with his peeler. But his phizz fell.

Now to the obverse. From velveteens to dimities is barely a fivefinger span and hence these camelback excesses are thought to have been instigated by one or either of the causing causes of all, those rushy hollow heroines in their skirtsleeves, be she ma-gretta be she the posque. Oh! Oh! Because it is a horrible thing to have to say to say to day but one dilalah, Lupita Lorette, short-ly after in a fit of the unexpectednesses drank carbolic with all her dear placid life before her and paled off while the other soiled dove that’s her sister-inlove, Luperca Latouche, finding one day while dodging chores that she stripped teasily for binocu-lar man and that her jambs were jimpjoyed to see each other, the nautchy girly soon found her fruitful hat too small for her and rapidly taking time, look, she rapidly took to necking, partying and selling her spare favours in the haymow or in lumber closets or in the greenawn ad huck (there are certain intimacies in all ladies’ lavastories we just lease to imagination) or in the sweet churchyard close itself for a bit of soft coal or an array of thin trunks, serving whom in fine that same hot coney a la Zingara which our own little Graunya of the chilired cheeks dished up to the greatsire of Oscar, that son of a Coole. Houri of the coast of emerald, arrah of the lacessive poghue, Aslim-all-Muslim, the resigned to her surrender, did not she, come leinster’s even, true dotter of a dearmud, (her pitch was Forty Steps and his perch old Cromwell’s Quarters) with so valkirry a licence as sent many a poor pucker packing to perdition, again and again, ay, and again sfidare him, tease fido, eh tease fido, eh eh tease fido, toos top-ples topple, stop, dug of a dog of a dgiaour, ye! Angealousmei! And did not he, like Arcoforty, farfar off Bissavolo, missbrand her behaveyous with iridescent huecry of down right mean false sop lap sick dope? Tawfulsdreck! A reine of the shee, a shebeen quean, a queen of pranks. A kingly man, of royal mien, regally robed, exalted be his glory! So gave so take: Now not, not now! He would just a min. Suffering trumpet! He thought he want. Whath? Hear, O hear, living of the land! Hungreb, dead era, hark! He hea, eyes ravenous on her lippling lills. He hear her voi of day gon by. He hears! Zay, zay, zay! But, by the beer of his profit, he cannot answer. Upterputty till rise and shine! Nor needs none shaft ne stele from Phenicia or Little Asia to obelise on the spout, neither pobalclock neither folksstone, nor sunkenness in Tomar’s Wood to bewray how erpressgangs score off the rued. The mouth that tells not will ever attract the unthinking tongue and so long as the obseen draws theirs which hear not so long till allearth’s dumbnation shall the blind lead the deaf. Tatcho, tawney yeeklings! The column of lumps lends the pattrin of the leaves behind us. If violence to life, limb and chattels, often as not, has been the expression, direct or through an agent male, of womanhid offended, (ah! ah!), has not levy of black mail from the times the fairies were in it, and fain for wilde erthe blothoms followed an impressive private reputation for whispered sins?

Now by memory inspired, turn wheel again to the whole of the wall. Where Gyant Blyant fronts Peannlueamoore There was once upon a wall and a hooghoog wall a was and such a wall-hole did exist. Ere ore or ire in Aaarlund. Or you Dair’s Hair or you Diggin Mosses or your horde of orts and oriorts to garble a garthen of Odin and the lost paladays when all the eddams ended with aves. Armen?

And let oggs be good old gaggles and Isther Estarr play Yesther Asterr. In the drema of Sorestost Areas, Diseased. A stonehinged gate then was for another thing while the suroptimist had bought and enlarged that shack under fair rental of one yearlyng sheep, (prime) value of sixpence, and one small yearlyng goat (cadet) value of eight-pence, to grow old and happy (hogg it and kidd him) for the re — minants of his years; and when everything was got up for the purpose he put an applegate on the place by no means as some pretext a bedstead in loo thereof to keep out donkeys (the pig-dirt hanging from the jags to this hour makes that clear) and just thenabouts the iron gape, by old custom left open to prevent the cats from getting at the gout, was triplepatlockt on him on purpose by his faithful poorters to keep him inside probably and possibly enaunter he felt like sticking out his chest too far and tempting gracious providence by a stroll on the peoplade’s egg-day, unused as he was yet to being freely clodded.

O, by the by, lets wee brag of praties, it ought to be always remembered in connection with what has gone before that there was a northroomer, Herr Betreffender, out for his zimmer hole-digs, digging in number 32 at the Rum and Puncheon (Branch of Dirty Dick’s free house) in Laxlip (where the Sockeye Sammons were stopping at the time orange fasting) prior to that, a Kom-merzial (Gorbotipacco, he was wreaking like Zentral Oylrubber) from Osterich, the U.S.E. paying (Gaul save the mark!) II/— in the week (Gosh, these wholly romads!) of conscience money in the first deal of Yuly wheil he was, swishing beesnest with bles-sure, and swobbing broguen eeriesh myth brockendootsch, making his reporterage on Der Fall Adams for the Frankofurto Siding, a Fastland payrodicule, and er, consstated that one had on him the Lynn O’Brien, a meltoned lammswolle, disturbed, and wider he might the same zurichschicken other he would, with tosend and obertosend tonnowatters, one monkey’s damages become. Now you must know, franksman, to make a heart of glass, that the game of gaze and bandstand butchery was merely a Patsy O’Strap tissue of threats and obuses such as roebucks raugh at pinnacle’s peak and after this sort. Humphrey’s unsolicited visitor, Davy or Titus, on a burgley’s clan march from the middle west, a hikely excellent crude man about road who knew his Bullfoost Mountains like a starling bierd, after doing a long dance untidled to Cloudy Green, deposend his bockstump on the waityoumay-wantme, after having blew some quaker’s (for you! Oates!) in through the houseking’s keyhole to attract attention, bleated through the gale outside which the tairor of his clothes was hog-callering, first, be the hirsuiter, that he would break his bulshey — wigger’s head for him, next, be the heeltapper, that he would break the gage over his lankyduckling head the same way he would crack a nut with a monkeywrench and, last of all, be the stirabouter, that he would give him his (or theumperom’s or any-bloody else’s) thickerthanwater to drink and his bleday steppe — brodhar’s into the bucket.

The Sound Of SunshineMichael Franti,"One two three, uhuh

I wake up in the morning its six o'clock
They say there may be rain but the sun is hot
I wish i had some time just to kill today
And i wish i had a dime for every bill i've got to pay
Some days you lose you win
And the water's as high as the times your in
So i just back in there where i learned to swim
Try to keep my head above it the best i can
That's why

Here i am, waiting for this storm to pass my by
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down

One two three, uhuh

I saw my friend bobby i said ""what's up man""
You got a little work or twenty to lend
I opened up my hand he said ""i'm glad to see
They can take away my job but not my friends""

Here i am, waiting for the storm to pass my by
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down

I wanna go where the summer never ends
With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The suns so hot and the waves in motion
And everything smells like sun tan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never seizing
And every single soul needs a little releasing
The sterio bumpin till the sun goes down
And i only wanna hear that sound

That's the sound of sunshine coming down
That's the sound of sunshine coming down

I said you're the one i wanna be with
When the sun goes down
I said you're the one i wanna be with
When the sun goes down
Singin you're the one i wanna be with
When the sun goes down

That's the sound of sunshine coming down
That's the sound of sunshine coming down"
FreakThe Smashing Pumpkins,"They poison our sweet mother earth
Destroy our sacred bodies
To fill our mouths with junk and
They call this knowledge but knowing nothing means knowing far far too much
They let our children starve in the name of peace
They march to the beat of a killing machine

Life is not a dream when you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream when you can't wake up from the dream you wanted

Oh, they'll pour the salt from your soul
Oh, they'll pour the salt from your soul

Scars and bars and 51 stars
In faith and milk and I'm drinking filth and disease
Oh pretty please I'm begging freedom
There's lives to be blinded
Servants unkinded
Before we've paid
And then we'll pay some more
Do you know the score? Cause I'm so fucking bored

Life is not a dream when you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream when you can't wake up from the dream you wanted

Oh, they'll pour the salt from your soul
Oh, they'll pour the salt from your soul

They'll sell your wounds as evidence of your hope

Life is not a dream when you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream when you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream
Life is not a…
Life is not a dream
Life is not a dream"
At Or With MeJack Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Are they laughing at or with me?
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes
I think that I'm so happy now
And I think this is a better you

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Are they laughing at or with me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Why can't we just say what we mean?

[Verse 2]
People are just trying to fit in
But is this something telling you?
You can't trust anyone in this town
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't put your money where your mouth is, baby
We don't want to see you choke
Nobody's choking around here anymore
Nobody's broken any high scores

[Bridge]
No dancing shoes have touched this dusty floors
For such a long, long time
For such a long, long time
For such a long time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh [4x]"
If It's LoveTrain,"[Verse 1]
While everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger
I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life
But I'm afraid when I hear stories
About husband and wife
There's no happy endings
No Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

[Verse 2]
Took a loan on a house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I want to buy ya everything
Except cologne
'Cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain
Where the rain falls mainly on the plain
Sounds insane
Because it is, we can laugh, we can sing
Have ten kids and give them everything
Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad that we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

[Verse 3]
You can move in
I won't ask where you've been
Because everybody has a past
When we're older
We'll do it all over again
When everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it for you

[Bridge]
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
Then the rest is just whatever

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me"
Summer DaySheryl Crow,"[Verse 1]
Every little thing that I felt that day
Never will forget, there was love in the air
I wasn't looking for love to come my way
Oh baby baby, but then I saw you there

[Chorus]
That summer day that I recall
You came into my life and you gave me hope and love
I just want to be what you want me to
That summer day that changed it all
You came into my life and you let me fall in love
My baby I just want to be with you

[Post-Chorus]
I just want to let it shine
I just want to let it shine
I just want to let it shine, ooh

[Verse 2]
Did you ever think you knew everything
Did you ever think you had it all figured out
Ooh baby baby, you know things can change
When someone loves you with no doubt

[Chorus]
That summer day that I recall
You came into my life and you gave me hope and love
I just want to be what you want me to
That summer day that changed it all
You came into my life and you let me fall in love
My baby I just want to be with you

[Bridge]
Can you hear me, baby, yeah
When I sing out for you
I knew we could make it, oh
The moment you came into my life
Don't you know that you keep me shining, yeah

[Chorus]
That summer day that I recall
You came into my life and you gave me hope and love
I just want to be what you want me to
That summer day you changed it all
You came into my life and you let me fall in love
Now baby I just want to be with you

[Outro]
I just want to let it shine
I just want to tell you I love you, baby, ooh
And I'm going to let it shine
Yeah, I'm going to let it shine
Yes, I'm going to let it shine, ooh
I just want to let it shine
I just want to let it shine
I just want to let it shine"
Angel DanceRobert Plant,"[Bridge]
Good night, sleep tight
The big bright sun has gone away
Done gone away
Goodbye, don't cry
Tomorrow will bring us a brand new day
We can run and play

[Hook]
And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall
Let them cry till the morning calls
Little angel dance
Little angel dance

[Verse]
Big night, bright lights
Time now to lay them all to rest
Put 'em all to rest
Bad guys, mean eyes
All gone away to where they belong
Let's just sing our song

[Hook]
And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall
Let them cry till the morning calls
Little angel dance
Little angel dance

[Bridge]
Good night, sleep tight
The big bright sun has gone away
Done gone away
Goodbye, don't cry
Tomorrow will bring us a brand new day
We can run and play

And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall
Let them cry till the morning calls

You Got MeCrash Kings,"Mary, I think you got me
You turn around, turn around, turn around
And throw it back
Sugar, I think you need me
You bring me down, bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down again

I think you got me where you want me
I think you got me where you want me, woman!

Mary, you drive me crazy
You look around, look around
But you're looking for excuses
Jenny, she does it for me
She's goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down tonight

I think you got me where you want me
I think you got me where you want me, woman!

I think you got me where you want me
I think you got me where you want me, woman!

I'm not a sex crazed teacher!
She looks at me to tell me when it's over
Cause I would never leave you high, and dry

Mary, I think it's over
You bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
And not again
Jenny, I hope you love me
I'm goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down tonight

I think you got me where you want me
I think you got me where you want me, woman!

I think you got me where you want me
I think you got me where you want me, common!

I'm not a sex crazed teacher!
She looks at me to tell me when it's over
Cause I would never leave you high, and dry"
Half Of My HeartJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1: John Mayer]
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 2: John Mayer]
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 3: John Mayer]
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

[Backup Vocals: Taylor Swift]
I can't stop loving you

But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

[Chorus 2: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do

[Outro: John Mayer ]
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart"
