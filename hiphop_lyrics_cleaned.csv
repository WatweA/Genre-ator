[Intro: Drake]
Astro, yeah
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

[Bridge: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]
Some-Some-Some-Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

[Bridge: Travis Scott, Swae Lee & Big Hawk]
Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Pl-Playin' for keeps
Someone said, motherfucker—someone said
Don't play us for weak

2,Drip Too HardLil Baby,"[Intro]
Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made"

In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser
Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nann favor
When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart
I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

7,Better NowPost Malone,"[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me"

Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)

We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?

Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

Checks I deposit (Checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Lot of model bitches check for me
Nigga, don’t check for me 'less you got checks for me
I kept a stick like a hobo, no checkin' me
Way back when D-Lo had the spot in Trestletree
So many hoes, had to get a vasectomy
She left her body home and brought her neck to me
I did a walk-through, they sent a jet to me
Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee
One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though
I was with the OGs learnin' 'bout the glass bowl
Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro
Break yourself, leave his brains on the dashboard
I'm with Ced and Lil Baby (Yeah)
We got four choppers that’s full (21)
Way before rappin’, on God, I was trappin', sneakin’ my Glock in Lacura (On God)
I got my K from Osama Bin Laden, lil' nigga he signed this shit (Straight up)
I'm 4L gang, if you reach for my chain, then a nigga gon' die in this bitch (On God)
A-B-C-D-E-F-G Wagon, y’all niggas doin' that big cappin' (21)
I ain't with the friendly shit
Closest thing y'all gettin' to a handshake is the beat clappin' (21)
Your mama gon' have to make a GoFundMe, y'all niggas keep doing that sneak jabbin' (Straight up)
Gucci had to kill the whole woods
Just to make Young Savage this motherfuckin' mink jacket (21)

Popped a pill got my head in the cloud (Huh)
Say my name, it'll bring out a crowd (Crowd)
We got paid, now my family proud (On God)
I been drippin' this drip since a child

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I hit your bitch, she a jump off
Cartier bracelets for her, they don't come off
They get the swag from Atlanta and run off
I make the boys swing the stick like a tomahawk
Runnin' this shit, what the fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Skinny jeans stuffed with them hundreds, they poke out
S65, I'm in a robot
I'm a real one, ain't running from nobody
Hellcat fast, you know that I show out
Ain't sparin' no bitch, give a fuck 'bout a blowout
If we wanna smoke with you, boy, you can't go out
Still gettin' money my label don't know 'bout
Court-side with the vibe with her toes out
Rich nigga, I come straight out the poor house
Trap goin' crazy right there by Morehouse
Dead end, me, Ced and more ahks
Bought a Benz, doubled back, bought a trap house
I'm with Savage in the 6 doin' donuts (Skrrt)
Youngins with me, they got fire, they gon' go nuts
Quarter-million in a baby blue Goyard
Buy it cash then I go in the motor
Drive fast, ain't no pullin' me over
Play with bags, you can tell by the odor
No alcohol, go get me a new soda

[Chorus: Gunna]
VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (No)
You don't know what I just saw (Saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)

28,Calling My SpiritKodak Black,"[Verse 1]
I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

[Verse 2]
I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention

I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did

Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

Before I walk around trying to act like I'm something I ain't, I just quit rapping (On God)

I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex

VVSs on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, gon' get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S

Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10 but I got there in four

You gon' fall into my trap, you gon' fall right through
Even when you're with your lover and your phone's on mute
When I call you an Uber, you gon' come right through
Need to cry you a river
If you lie, won't forgive you
And I won't ever, ever trust you
And I won't ever, ever miss you
And yeah I love my baby mother
But if she fuck another nigga
I won't ever, ever touch her
And don't you ever get it twisted
Yeah, I'ma cry me a river
Just get it out your system
You know how much I really want you
You know I'll never ever forget you
Way too much time spent on strippers
Ain't mean to cut you out the picture
I don't mean to be callin' you ""bitch"" and shit
But I be buggin' off the liquor
The muscle relaxant was workin'
Throwin' it back while she squirtin'
Don't need surgery, you're perfect
Remember when bitches was curvin'

Tryna bribe me with a bag, wait, nigga, hold up
If you ever try to play me, nigga, you's a whole dub, whole dub
Always got what I wanted
Never asked nobody for nothin'
I can take a trip to the islands alone
But if you want it you
Gotta come with somethin' new
I don't know what's wrong with you
So over your petty games, you're getting way too comfortable
Oh-oh, oh
Gettin' real comfortable treatin' me like a regular
Don't bring out the worst in me when I bring out the best in you
Boy, I ain't average
Don't make me turn savage
I need you to see that I'm no regular girl

If you want it, you got it, you know how I'm rockin’
They never could stop it, it's stuffed in my pocket
I got up for the score and they never could block it
After the show, I count up in a Masi'
Tears fall from the lies, despite
Hunnid bands through the time of the night
When you left, I ain’t wanna live life
Now I'm happy on the in and outside
Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Spin the block, finna stretch 'em
Wake the hood up when we wet 'em
And it's all gon' be alright, yeah
When that wrong choice take your life, yeah
Gucci print should be on top of that Nike print
From them rich niggas kickin' yo’ back door
And they should give a Rollie to niggas who want it
Who don’t know a thing but trap, though
Blue faces, I put that over nat hoes
The shit that we sellin' will make you relapse, though
Thinkin’ I'm slippin', run up and get clapped, ho
I put that North on the map, ho (Gang)

[Verse 1]
Turn up on a bitch when I'm gone off a Perc
That ho gon’ fuck on a fast beat
Ben behind me, do the dash, keepin' up in a Vert
You get jacked out yo' shit, you can't text me
Pussy nigga throwin' shots, ain't at me
Strapped up, tell that nigga get at me
Tough love for a bitch, won't trap me
Pay for the body then I give them the MAC free
Got a pound in the car, I'ma smoke on that
Left the state for a show and I'm comin' back
If he say he want smoke, ain't no fallin' back
Want a bitch for the play, I'ma blow the strap
He ain't usin' his head, put it in his lap
He ain't 'bout it, could tell that he only rap
I just put 40 bands inside the trap
Every manifestation, I'm callin' rare (Gang)

Now can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Tell Jugg bust a right, yeah
Hop out, gun flames through the night, yeah
You know how I'm rockin', you know that I'm with it
You loyal to me, I'll make sure that you get it
If you want it, you got it, you know how I'm rockin'
They never could stop it, it's stuffed in my pocket
I go up for the score and they never could block it
After the show, I count up in a Masi'
Tears fall from the lies, despite
Hunnid bands through the time of the night
When you left, I ain't wanna live life
Now I'm happy on the in and outside

Pick it up, throw it out, watch it come back
Got a whole hunnid racks in a Dior bag
Count up that money, I run up the sack
Boardin' on the jet with a illegal strap
The shit that they talk, I could tell you is cap
Up off the X and I only took half
Stay energized, I fall back from the tabs
Put a half in my way, I'ma pay off the staff
I feel like it ain't no bitch I can't have
Saint Laurent boot with the fur like a bear
Balenciaga, that Gucci, and Prada
I got on all three and I bought several pair
When it's up, what we slidin' in, duckin' from 12
Time wise, clockwise, I never fail (No)
Ain't no slackin', we hustlin', we on this for real
If we don't get it, we take it, you know what it is

Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Now, can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Spin the block, finna stretch 'em
Wake the hood up when we wet 'em
And it's all gon' be alright, yeah
When that wrong choice take your life, yeah
Gucci pressure be on top of that Nike print (Shh)
From them rich niggas kickin' yo' back door
And they should give a Rollie to niggas who want it
Who don't know a thing but trap, though

You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck

If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck

I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat
Word on the street
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular
That boy got the sauce on the RAGÚ-lar

Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, ""No, I don't wanna pay my bills""
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your— follow your—, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood

Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)"

His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, ""You loved me first"" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, ""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)

Slime, yeah, slime

[Verse 1]
I'ma say I'm sorry for all of the shit that I had did
And I'm thankful for that shit that you had done while we was kids
Been puttin' my soul up in this music and I'm hopin' that you hear it
I'm steady screamin' 4K Trey, I'm tryna split a nigga wig
All these bitches tellin' lies, but if you know me, don't think twice
Instead of doin' what's wrong, lil' bitch, you do what's right
I feel like fuck livin' disguised
I showed my wrong, don't hide my right
You saw me down, you tryna show off for the hype
(Hey, don't do that lame ass shit)
I fuck with you, but you don't fuck with me
But somehow we still find a way to text each other 'fore we go to sleep
I don't know shit about no Jodeci
But you gon' suck me to his music while I sit back, think, and smoke my weed
These killers 'round me, they look up to me
I got them bodies, I won't say no names, I hope it don't catch up to me
You really mad that you can't fuck with me
You X'd me out, you ain't have to fuck with me
Nigga, why you came to fuck with me?

Told you that I'd do anything for you
I just don't know what they want
And I wasn't frontin' when I told you I love you
Girl, you the only one that I want
These niggas be cappin'
We pull up slangin' that static
Don't do no talkin', have your shit together when we come
I got too many brothers that done died by the gun
I murder from the heart, so you can say what you want

[Verse 2]
They say she fucked with that nigga, I wish I caught her
Smokin' on this Cherry Pie, fuckin' your favorite athlete daughter
They say that nigga that been trippin', put that bitch in order
I just came through swervin', nigga, in a Hellcat Charger
Jigga was swervin' behind me, turn up in a Benz
Studio session, go in
Tell 'em lil' niggas I said for them not to walk in
Up with the Glock, let off ten
Poppin' them bottles of lean with Instagram models, stayin' at the Drury Inn
I know she don't drink, she said that she drink, I let her just sip what she can
I say, ""Lil' Ben, you hear them talkin'?"" He say ""Uh-uh""
I hit the gas and then we turn up on they ass
Ran up my money, and they hear it when I talk now
Them bitches know it's over with, they in my past
'Cause you left ice on my heart
And I could say that ho wasn't wrong, you wasn't right from the start
I wish you could exchange my time for that watch that I bought
Really was tryna make you mine, I don't know what I had thought

[Chorus]
Told you that I'd do anything for you
I just don't know what they want
And I wasn't frontin' when I told you I love you
Girl, you the only one that I want

Don't do no talkin', have your shit together when we come

Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was ducking them people
Ducking them birds sending out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I’m dripping water nigga, Aquafina
Damn that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I got to leave her

Looked up to Pablo Escobar, Money Meech, and Chapo

Bitch I was serving the sidewalk
Then I copped the drop hopped in the streets
You can't name a young nigga that’s hot as me
All my niggas do murders and robberies
Got about 20 racks in the Robin Jeans
Niggas thinking I won off the lottery
When I hop in the push start with the pound
Niggas know that it ain't no stopping me
Outta town champ like Mayweather
Got a new crib off the boxing ring
Put the new Forgiatos on the Jeep
Run up 30 in a week

I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, ""Fuck 'em all""?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?

[Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

[Interlude]
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause ""you'll never be Kenny""
""You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole""
""You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,"" yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love your—'member, love yourself

[Outro]
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah"

Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K

Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows

We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission

Bitch, it's Tina Snow, they love me 'cause I'm cold
And you can't take no nigga from me, I got mind control
I wanna fuck in the mirror, I like to look at your face when you in it
Come in the room and I'm givin' commands, I am the captain and he the lieutenant
I need that neck like a muh'fuckin pendant
Need you to spit, make that muh'fucker glisten
Tell him, ""Shut up,"" make that muh'fucker listen
I bet he gon' like it, he won't do no trippin'

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody freak like me (Hell nah)

[Chorus]
He like, ""Baby let me rub, let me rub on ya'
Can I get a lil' love, lil' love from ya'?""
My body addictive, it's driving him crazy

Don't know what to do without it
He fuckin' with you? I doubt it
They don't understand that I'm all in his head
And it's nothin' to do with my body

[Post-Chorus]
You been fiendin' for me lately, going brazy, brazy

I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look

Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, ""Nigga, live your life and grow""
I'd tell you, ""Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke""

Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

Heavy is the crown only for the weak

And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?

Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless

Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back (Do-do-do-do-do, yeah)
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it

Girl, you so perfect, I think that it's workin’
You gave me your love, now I really want more

Girl, you was down and you told me you roll like my Rollie
I'm done 'cause you lie with my guys, like nah
The only plan was to ball
Remember them times when we fall, but we got up and fought
I tried to leave, you would stall

Yeah, you used to ride like a taxi
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea

I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold hearted nigga, wet tha blocka, blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?

[Verse 1]
When I'm in traffic gotta slide with the beam on me
'Cause I keep 'bout ten racks bussin' out the jeans on me
Niggas be hatin', I'm rich, it's all about the cream, homie
If I ever get caught lackin', they gon' slide
Ever since I got the Rollie, I ain't got the time
Flawless diamonds, niggas can't never block the shine
They know I'm ballin' in the city like DeRozan
Gotta keep my niggas 'round me, I can't do the wrong friends
I was knockin' down walls, now they closin' in
Hopped off the porch, and then I hopped inside the Porsche, ayy
Fuck being the side nigga, I'ma be the main course
Whipped the Rolls like a young nigga made for it

I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta

How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?

[Verse 2]
Tryna get my bag, I had to go and make it happen
Me and my dogs, we was bussin' out them bandos
Count out them hunnids, then we throw it in the mattress
Wrap it in plastic, and throw it in the attic
I be in the streets, nigga, I stand ten toes
Any nigga in my situation would've been fold
We was trappin' out the basement, made it back tenfold
Gotta stay out the way, that's why I'm always behind the tint for
We was fightin' fed cases, 'member I was 2 and 0
Nigga was fightin' depression, sippin' syrup, I was movin' slow
I was down below, but still, I always kept my head up
Nigga gotta get my bread up, I don't wanna die young
No, no, no

I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta

Young rich nigga bossed up on his own mayne
My new shit sound like it's ""Soul Train""
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain
RSC, we fo' sho bang
Tiny locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the 80's? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
What you drove through to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day
Drive-by's, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage

Leave her in the bed, legs tremblin'
Gettin' banged on for your Pendleton's

Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip so

Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut

Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy

Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillan en la luz son los que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh, you stay
Tell me why you (Another one)
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado

You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh

Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahahahaha

Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies

[Verse 1: Logic]
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school ""He's cool, he's not"" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said ""Rover"" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

[Outro: Chris D'Elia]
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'

Dammit, a can of pada-"

Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah

But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em

Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door

Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun

Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave

When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face

Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts

Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)

My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

Fuck the judge, fuck the bailiff, fuck the local reporter (Fuck 'em)
Tell the whole truth to my lawyer, Guwop slicker than oil (Oil)
Park the Dawn, rode the Wraith, took the trip with the art
Look like a Rolls dealership every time I bring out my cars
Fuckin' stars, buy the bar, neighborhood superstar (It's Gucci)

You decide if I live or die
When you're close, I'm alive, I can feel the sky
I just want your body close to me, oh!

I hope they kill us with a ghost in the Lambo
And the doors goin' up, suicide

I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want you spread out on the sheets

150,OmertaDrake,"[Verse]
Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah"

Father said that I was a force

Wanna make it home? Then get out the Porsche
Let a nigga cover FADER 'fore I have to fade a nigga at the FADER Fort
It’s tomato or tomato, either way, the boy the greatest
Play it, I won't say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown

Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
The poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary, G.O.A.T.​
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God

You could die today, so be hell to pay

So don't test me, homie, put the knee in horny
Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone
All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams
Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya
I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through
All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show
Might get tattooed on tour, tell ya ho get the door
Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts
Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind
It's a brand new season, I'm a righteous heathen
I take on the challenge and I leave it bleedin'
I was down bad, now I'm even Steven
And I'm leavin', leavin' every fuckin' weekend (Oh)

Gäris vill ba' bang bang, aldrig får man andrum
Bokarna dom ringer ifrån Thailand ner till Cancún
Folk som bruka' klicka nu dom ringer på min Samsung
Frågar hur ja lyckats göra millar av en pantburk
Ni är lite chow chow, vi är lite kamphund
Ni är liten nio millimeter mot min magnum
Paus, faktum benim åker land runt
Du ba' sitter bitter på ditt kassajobb på kvantum

[Vers 2: ODZ]
Benim han har fått psykos, chaggas ut i Västerås
Benim han vill tagga dit, stänger av min telefon
Ta på några fasta lår, bläddra genom en katalog
Hoppas chagga svarar nu, fuck vill tagga härifrån
Jag vill bara varva ner, chilla på nån ateljé
Sitta där några dagar, puffa på nå kvalité
Benim ut å tourar nu, fuck va jag har lovat nu
Förlåt nu till den här gärin men fuck va detta spårar ur

[Vers 3: Frej Larsson]
Du sa i bilen hit att du kommer mörda
Så kom upp på scenen om du ville tävla
För några år sen så var det kanske nära
Men det märks väl att du slutade å träna
Lilla killen ey nu dallrar du med knäna
Kippar efter luft som om du hade ett par gälar
Vi har aldrig varit mer säkra
Serverar biff ja då måste du äta
Varför beter du dig som det är horn i min panna?
Som jag blivit för stor för å fatta
Jag försöker bara tjäna flous till min mamma
Eyyy tro inget annat
Men jag hörde att du snacka mer än en golares mamma
Tills nån sätter en pistol i din panna
Lägger dig i snön lovikkavantar
Godis, sandpapper, massa roliga knappar
Jag kommer aldrig sluta träna
Så länge min familj måste äta
Jag kommer aldrig sluta träna
Så länge min familj måste äta

[Vers 4: ODZ]
Spiken i kistan, beatsen begravda
Skiten e på riktigt våra låtar e betalda
Allting här är maxat till det optimala
Mina tingdems skickar dig till Nangijala
Rökfyllda portar hör till det normala
Kläderna på kroppen jag behöver ej betala
Nykter? Säkert? Ge mig nåt ja tar ba'

157,Goodes',"[Verse 1]
I used to look in the mirror
Felt so uncomfortable
I always felt like I was different from everybody else
I didn't want any attention
I got lost in the crowd
So busy tryna fit in
When I was born to stand out

[Pre-Chorus]
I felt like my best
Wasn't good enough (Wasn't good enough)
But I'm not the same girl
That I once was

[Chorus]
I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry 'bout what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
I'm feeling good

[Verse 2]
If you ever feel like I did
No, it don't have to be that way
'Cause you are perfect the way you are
You shouldn't have to be ashamed
'Cause we are all a work in progress
You gotta work with that you got
Rather be true to myself
Than to be who I'm not

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're unlike anyone else you know
That's what makes you original

[Chorus]
I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry 'bout what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
I'm feeling good

[Bridge]
Let go of who you think that you need to be
You are so much more than what they may see
Let it all out and set it free
Darlin', what you got is all you need
Let go of who you think that you need to be
You are so much more than what they may see
Let it all out and set it free
Darlin', what you got is all you need

[Chorus]
I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry about what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
I'm feeling good"

Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs

I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical

166,Remember The NameEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem, 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot

Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes

Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot

Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out

My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
And shit, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga

I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin’ like I’m gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need…

[Post-Chorus]
Time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

[Post-Chorus]
Time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)"

Whip, bought it
Crib, got it
Job, on it
Did I ever
Ask you to take me to go
Shopping in Paris or go
Sailing overseas and just
Drape me in Gucci? No
All I ever asked was you to
Pick up the phone when you alone
All I ever asked was you to
Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No, I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off

[Chorus]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go'n stop playing games
Playing games

[Verse 2]
I know you sayin', ""Hit my line""
I'm on your mind, and that
You want this bad
So I'm cool with that
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction
Is you really 'bout that action?
Really want to give your all
But flex in front of your friends

Swear that you doing the most
But we take a picture, can't post it

When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we’ve been talking for ages

What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'

You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving

But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more (No), been waitin' too long (Yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy, ooh)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake (Awake)
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)
I'm too tired to forgive ya (Ayy), it's too hard on my liver (Ayy)
And you know (Ayy) it’s all (Ayy) over now
All your friends (Ayy), you know (Ayy) they sold you out

[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (Die for me)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (Lying to me)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me (High with me)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (Side I see)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Lie, lie, lie)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (You lied, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights (Yeah)
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
Your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran)

[Chorus: Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (That you would die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (You'd been lying)
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me (You was high)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (A different side)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Said you'd die, you said you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Know you're lying)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)"

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain’t ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on ’em 'cause I'm too clever

Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Yeah, they bet I'ma fall
And I’m only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, can’t remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin’ a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain’t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever (Too clever)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, where you been? (Where you been?)
When it was time to do some work and put it in (Put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (Ha)
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Chorus]
I'ma leave here with what I came here for, now what you sayin'?
You don't wan' take it there, don't go there with us, nah
Walked in with a Styrofoam cup with plenty racks off in my hands
And we ain't come here for to lose, we want it all
Smokin' dro 'cause I need it
So I could be calm instead of dangerous when you see me
You niggas know we quick to let it blow for any reason
Kick down your door, post up on your front porch, and we ain't leavin'

[Verse 1]
When my grandma died, I had to beat the odds and it wasn't easy
When Boozilla died, I almost lost my mind, broke me to pieces
We was slangin' iron for Dump and all the rest, it ain't no secret
38 across my neck, we be them boys you don't want beef with
Smokin' dro, smell it when I hit the door, 'cause I need it
I ain't the one, these pussy niggas know I be fiendin'
Hop out the car with diamonds 'round my throat, bitch, I'm beamin'
I don't think no nigga can't see me, I be paranoid while I'm leanin'

[Chorus]
Smokin' dro 'cause I need it
So I could be calm instead of dangerous when you see me
You niggas know we quick to let it blow for any reason

Walked in with a Styrofoam cup with plenty racks off in my hands
And we ain't come here for to lose, we want it all

[Verse 2]
Whole lot of racks on these VV's
I'm so slime, on this Glock, got a green beam
Got a whole lot of people that need me
Bust your head all over the right thing
I ain't got nothin' but a dub and a Black Card up inside my Ami' jeans
I just want head, can't fuck in a bed, it's just some things don't excite me
Testin' your gun inside of the backyard, let it hit, get your aim up
My youngin official, he wait in your backyard, and I call him the bang thug
Wake up in the morning, get fresh as a bitch, I'ma walk in Dior and some Margielas
And the way we gon' dump at the boy with the stick, I'ma finish him off with a four nickel
I be thinkin' 'bout Dump all over the time, this shit just don't feel right
I don't go to no club, I be takin' these drugs, ridin' and keepin' that steel tight
Every night 'fore I sleep, I think 'bout the North Side where I grew up, no ho type
Play, I put you to sleep before you could see (Bitch)
Pull up where you be and it's on sight

I'ma leave here with what I came here for, now what you sayin'?
You don't wan' take it there, don't go there with us, nah

Yeah, look

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 1]
Stay in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust

[Interlude]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 2]
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that"

Flexin' hard, call me Popeye, wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate, I'm first to finish, ayy

To the grave, might just be tomorrow, might just be today
So I always live it up, we poppin' bottles, poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch, I ain't even had to pay
Had to put on for the team and had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear Robin's wings, I can't stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship, we go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case
Blast off, blast off, see the stars up in the Wraith
You can't get into the crib because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section, I'm gon' put you into place
If your club goin' up, you bet I'm sliding like it's chess
And I think I fell in love, she shook that ass up in my face

[Chorus]
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed

She just can't seem to keep her knees closed

We loved each other way more than we loved life
Helluva made this beat, baby
Still do (Ayy, JB)

[Verse 1]
I used to be like, ""I don't need security"" (Street niggas)
I don't want these niggas thinking that it's fear in me (At all)
Told my driver, ""Be on point,"" he wasn't hearing' me (Driver)
Those shots went off, I'm steady callin', you ain't answerin', you scarin' me (Hello?)
In my city, if you winnin', you can't stay
They call bein' broke, ""Real,"" they call gettin' money, ""Fake""
I gave you a bitch, why you still lookin' at my date?
I gave you some food, why you still lookin' at my plate, nigga?
They say they love us, but that love might be hate
I can't really tell the difference, salt and sugar look the same (It's tricky)
Look how they did Dex, look how they did Blade (Damn)
Look how they tried to do me, but got JB
Man, that jealousy so real, man, that hate so deep
Man, that envy shit so real, you make it out these streets
You saw it wasn't me and still shot, what she do to you? (What she do to you?)
We was just winnin', now I'm cryin' at your funeral
But every tear I shed another thousand on your head, nigga (That's on my fuckin' mama)

And I was in that bank with you
You know your favorite rapper wouldn't have never let them guys get you
I would've shot 'em, left 'em dyin', leakin' in the street
Wouldn't have ran, would've smoke the Runtz and watch that man go to sleep
And you think they came for her? Man, you know they came for me
They took my heart and my brains, niggas know that I can't think
How I'm playin' with these drums, niggas know I'm like Tay Keith
Eyes bloodshot red, niggas know I ain't been sleepin'
But all these dead loved ones make it hard to sleep (Make it hard to sleep)
All this anger inside make it hard to grieve (Make it hard to grieve)
Ayy, all this nicotine make it hard to breathe (Make it hard to breathe)
All these tears in my eyes make it hard to sleep (Make it hard to sleep)
They found a murder weapon, bro, it's gon' be hard to beat (It's gon' be hard to beat)
First offer fifty years, so it's hard to plea, ayy (It's gon' be hard to plea)
And if they do somethin' to us, then they known for it (They known for it)
But if we do somethin' to them, then we wrong for it (Then we wrong for it)

Fuck that, if you take mines, I take yours, homie (I take yours, homie)

If we tear this bitch up, they gon' say I'm dead wrong (Dead wrong)
Fuck that, these niggas got my auntie with a headstone (Damn)
Niggas tellin' me what to do like they smart as me (What?)
But they ain't take your heart from you, they took my heart from me (Bitch)
I got one less person that wanted more from me
Ready to kill whoever play with me or shorted me (Don't play)
I got your kids, I got Nanni, I got Nell too
I got your babies, Kee and Zi and Gabrielle too (Oh)
I got your sister and your mommy and your fam' too (I got 'em)
How the fuck you gon' die on me? I can't stand you (Damn)
I pray they don't go to jail, I want 'em dead
I'm just listenin' to the streets, hearin' everything they sayin'
I'm just waitin' on a name, I'm just prayin' that they say it
Give a fuck if it's the Mayor, nigga, million on his head, ayy, ayy (Whole ticket on his top)
Wish I could wake you up and beat your ass
'Cause I was just tellin' you about them dreams I had (Free my mama)
Ayy, niggas snatched my heart out my chest, can't nobody replace it
Wouldn't have ever believed you was fuckin' with your baby
""Make sure Tee good"" is all I ever heard you sayin'
Tryna hold my head, I don't know if I'ma make it (Mhm)
This shit been eatin' me (Eatin' up)
I don't know what you seen in me, but you believed in me ('Lieved in me)
Tell them ""Keep that fake love, let me grieve in peace"" (Fuck that shit)

[Chorus]
You drop mines, I drop yours, homie (I drop yours)
You drop one, I drop four, homie (I drop it four)
Then be like, ""God, please don't be too hard on me"" (God, please)
God, please don't close the door on me (Please)"

202,Lonely ChildYoungBoy Never Broke Again,"[Intro]
Pipe that shit up, TNT
I just wanna be loved
D-Mac on the fuckin' track
Don’t nobody understand me though
Tahj Money
The way I came in the game
The image that I had put out
They wouldn't expect me to have feelings
Know it probably don't seem like it
That’s why they talk about me like I ain't human, but we all is
But I'm still being me
I'm still in the streets and I'm still thuggin' until them niggas put me under, yeah
That's how we livin' and that's how we going out, you hear me? Open your mouth

[Verse 1]
I say, mama, I'm so sorry
I got ice burned where my heart at
On the road where I had it hard at
How I'm chosen? I'm so heartless, so, so heartless
I ain't know my age, he was 16, they killed Lil Dave
Mind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain
I ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man
I love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change
I pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me
They keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me
I cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe
I cannot hold on without you on side of me
I never knew this fame would take the ones I love from ‘way from me
I wanna see Kacey bad, but I can't seem to call Nene
Go in with no pen and pad, I got this shit right on my sleeve
Right now my candle burning wax, I'm feelin' like it's burnin' me

[Chorus]
I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with Kaylyn, without even knowin' this bitch done snaked me
I'm missin' Yaya daily, the one who don't make me feel basic
Happiness I'm chasin', while killers behind me tryna blank me
You don't know what I'm feelin'
Or what I'm thinkin' and you can't change me
I miss my fuckin' daddy, I've been callin' Montana my father
Times been gettin' harder
I came from nothing, now bitch, I'm royal
I call Monique my mama, but Lord knows I need Sheronda
I don't need no commas, I'm feeling like I'm going under
My paw-paw getting old, and once he gone, I'm on my own
Right now I'm all alone, I pray that grandmom keep me strong
Can't even leave my home, my bracelet beeping plus I'm down
I just wan' be gone, my son straight, my money long
Tell me what you feelin', I hope that I can help you out
My youngins in that North, I pray that y'all gon' make it out
These bitches comin' 'round, and they don't even like my songs
I'll burn up the town, before them niggas bust my dome
I wish that I can hear Dump say, ""What up, lil brother,"" one more time
We killing shit and plus we dying
I'm gon' go off behind my brother, fuck this charge, I slang that iron
Before he go and I don't ride

[Chorus]
I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild
I'm just a lonely child
Who need someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, my pain away
Because my thoughts been runnin' wild

I need some help because my life been real hard
The way I approached the game, it seem that I'm hard
But I got feelings too just like a lil' boy, oh Lord

But did I mention this my own clothin'?
The fuck you mean?
Made nigga, bought my own Rollie
But if them crackers pull me over, they gon' say I stole it
Good mornin', we on it, I went bought two S trophies
My father left my sis and bros, to them, I feel I owed it
But let's not be heroic, 'cause everybody roguish
They don't want us totin' guns, but they let the fuckin' killers tote it
Let's take a ride and see, though, where them people be, though
Colt 45, the grip design, bought this bitch from Casino
Soprano, no Soprino, we live life like Yung Bino
Had a show in B-more, after that post on the block with Chino (I'm a hustlin' motherfucker)
Look for a star on every hundred, C note
I'm the top on YouTube, fuck a new school, I don't use no Vevo
These niggas 'round me, they too cruel, they bust tools and die for me, though
I don't pay money for no life, the murder pay off me, so

Came out alright
But I'm blinded from the life, I can’t see, though
Got juveniles on the block, thirty stick hangin' out the Glock
Bandana tied 'round the clip, and they go all out for me, though

Sucked all the pain up, let's fuck the game up
Plenty niggas on the block pushin' that rock (It's the Carter's son)

I can't say I'm fucking with all this involvement
These niggas ain't right and they ballin'
I don't give a fuck, no, I call up Osama, my baba
Like, ""Load up and come and rob all them"" (Rob all them)
Venezuela ventilator
My first trip to Georgia made 'em
Some companions with ambitions, was
Double G, NBA native
I wish baptism could've saved us
Never broke until the grave in
Excuse ourselves, knock on the tables
I make a pussy bite the pavement
I can't say I'm fucking with all this involvement
These niggas ain't right and they ballin'
I don't give a fuck, no, I call up Osama, my baba

Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Bridge]
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless

Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe

Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe

Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle

Isn't this worth saving?
I can feel you fading off
We're not gonna make it long
Guess you cannot take it
Guess it's worth sayin'

Am I being heard? Nah, yeah

I've been hearin' things and seeing things and so it seems you movin' on from me
Caught you on the scene with little miss thing, and trust me, she really don't want beef

I want better for you movin' forward, what's better for you than me?

The audacity to question me, like you ain't leave me out here on my own
I was traumatized and suicidal, I'm sick and tired, I am not to blame
Once I felt a way, but not today, I'm not afraid, now I can say
Get your bitch ass off of my phone, please leave me alone
I am not your girl anymore, you need to watch your tone
Don't worry about who it is I'm fuckin' or who I am lovin', just know that it is not you
This isn't up for discussion, I wish you good luck, man

Results of those post damages that I haven't dealt with
And I only want the best for you, movin' forward
But you backtracking with niggas that ain't shit for you, don't belong around your aura
You know there's not a day in these modern times
You haven't crossed my mind, we both crossed the line
Seems like I needed you more than I needed myself
Just like I always felt like cheatin' on you would be cheatin' myself
To me, that's just some dumb shit for you to say we done with
Tryna speak your heart, tryna make your mark
Then go deeper and make a scar
But every time I lay down I think about you naked
And if you find my replacement, how could you?
I made you come nine times in one day
Your two lips should come in a vase, you rode my face
I realize you look as good as you taste, hmm (Yeah)
Fingers all in your mouth, I'm grabbin' you up and dickin' you down
I'm grabbin' your waist, your room is my only escape
I guess that's none of your concern"

[Verse 1: Rod Wave]
Let’s talk 'bout hard times, real bottom boy survivor
Way before the jewelry, the groupie hoes, and designer
Back when I was tryna find a way for all my partners
Rema hit the window, popped the door for me and Lijah
'Member wakin’ up with no destination
But I had some dedication, couldn't use my education
'Cause no nine dollars could help me face what I was facing
My light bill due, envelope blue, that mean you behind on payments
Rap slowed down and I was low on cash
Fresh out of high school, kicked out the house for living fast
Went and got a spot, then got a job, 'cause pops was on my ass
Then that's when pops had went to jail so it didn't last
Hit the block with Brock 'cause I was tryna pay my bills
Like fuck a rap career, let's touch these streets and make a mil’
Fast forward, like Rod Wave, tell me how you feel
When I think about my past, that shit give me chills, uh

[Chorus: Rod Wave & Kevin Gates]
Wake up in the morning, hit my knees, and I pray
Because He finally made a way
I been runnin’ up that paper, mama
And before I let 'em come and take it, mama
I’ma die in these Cuban links
I'm gon' die in these Cuban links (Bangers again)
Die in these Cuban links (Right now today, let's go)
Die in these Cuban links (Yes, Lord)

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
All my life it been a struggle
You on and fall off, you find out who really love you
Playin’ in the storm drain, came out the gutter
Good relationships, I admit I had a couple
Making love to the money, me and bae lil' couple
Yola cooked down to the oil in it, don't switch around
I need everything when it lock in the pot, yeah
Grab it off the top, let it dry, work the clock, yeah
Finally up in rank, movin' blocks, holdin' sham, yeah
Havin' my lil' way, ghetto pussy used to act funny
Now I'm hittin' her hard from the back, she throw it back for me
And when I went to jail, shawty left, turned her back on me
Flexin' on they ass, pants sag with them racks on 'em

[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Wake up in the morning, hit my knees, and I pray
Because He finally made a way
I been runnin' up that paper, mama
And before I let 'em come and take it, mama

Pull one at my show 'cause I like fans
Later on, I got two in my night plans

238,RiverEminem,"[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"

Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch

I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

I'm sorry that I let you down

Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud

Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia

Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo ho if yo bitch keep eyein' me

I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky

'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars

Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah

Tunechi

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

[Chorus: Kodak Black & Lil Wayne]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky

I can't text her back, these Franklins what I'm thumbing through (Blue hunnos)
Fuck a finger in that bitch, I use a thumb or two (Yeah)
Made her number one and you ain't even number two

[Pre-Chorus: NAV & Lil Uzi Vert]
All this ice I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whipping up two-seaters (Skrrt, skrrt)
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker

Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you"
268,Walk On WaterEminem,"[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair

Home, home
Someone take me

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I've been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe

Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces

I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone

271,BelieveEminem,"[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?"

Okay, peace sign and flashes
I live that picture perfect life you lie 'bout in your captions (mm, mm, mm)
When I was down, I swear they made me feel inferior (straight up)
Judgin' me by my outside, that's just my exterior (straight up)
Not seeing what I was made of, that's my interior (real shit)
Didn't let that shit break me, instead, I broke the barriers
So fuck all y'all, praise Allah
It's my perog' like Bobby, bruh, massages by Nautia
In my castle like Mario, I give this shit my heart and soul
You boys got no cardio, all of my soldiers rock army clothes
'Head of my time like Marty though
Watchin' the Rick and Morty show, while I smoke
All these bands, still fuck her on the floor
Came from the dirt, all I had to do was grow
Remember when my shit got repossessed (damn)
Mm, that shit had us workin' like we possessed (goddamn)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Big Sean]
Me and my best friend, 7-Eleven (yeah)

I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
(Fuck you, too)
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?

Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?

279,Like HomeEminem,"[Intro]
Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (Yeah)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home"

Welcome to America baby (uh)
Home of the brave, American Dream, you know? (yeah)
Uh, yeah, yeah
Let’s go

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (what's up?)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (I knew it nigga!)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (what's up?)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
You either good or you great, you either real or you fake
That's why I stay spittin' the real because the real ones relate
Y'all must was raised by some haters, you niggas go ahead and hate
F-F-Four car garage for the 'Rari, that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky, glad I ain't fall for the bait
So focused and I'm determined, can see that shit in my face
You niggas go 'head and face it, lil' bitch, ain't shit 'bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and went and iced out a bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a two fifty to a half, I got the recipe
First, my president was black, now my president is wack
I ain't never going broke, what's American in that?

[Chorus: Jeezy & J. Cole]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler (yeah)
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (ha ha!)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (alright)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (alright)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Got money to make, blow out the candles then cut up the cake
Then I put it on plate, I'm running the game, you running in place
Still a youngin' at heart, but mentally, bitch I'm a hunnid'-and-eight
Like Pun in the late 90s, my niggas is juggling weight
Running from state to state, gun in the waist for safety
I'm on a paper chase, whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire, silly 'cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?
Y'all make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
'Cause that's the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching 'em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preaching ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (ha ha!)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

These streets made for ballin' (yeah yuh)
Ten toes ain't for fallin' (yeah yuh)

282,SoberG-Eazy,"[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth & (G-Eazy)]
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo (you know)
Oooo-oooo ooo (story of my fucking life, haha)
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Eazy
Uh, yeah, I might regret this when tomorrow comes
But, them drunk nights are more fun than sober ones
With every shot, they're like ""Aw, here Kobe comes!""
But I got this bad bitch tryna to throw me buns
If I listened to my Uncs, all them older ones
They all talk about karma, how it slowly comes (uh)
But, life is short, enjoy it while you're young
Spend my bank account tonight and have to borrow funds
It all started with a light glass
Now I'm asking ""How long could tonight last?""
Man, she had an eeh face with a tight ass
If I had a shot less, then I might pass
But, I'm faded and I got a little sedated
I can't believe we made it, every night we celebrate it
I live like Jim Morrison, no telling where I'll take it
I take her to my room and I tell her ""Get naked""

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I slipped up with my ex and I smashed again
Stayed over, now she's about to get attached again
Walls built up around, they come crashing in
Passed out at 6 A.M., but she's up at 10
Doing this was not in my plans
She got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
Hoop earrings, some bitch left on my nightstand
Cussed me out and stormed off like ""Alright then"" (uh)
On both sides, that was bad for 'em
Why do people do things that be bad for 'em?
Say we done with these things, then we ask for 'em
When the sun comes down, then we transform
Yeah, you can probably bet this
By this time tomorrow, I'll probably regret this
Try, but it all falls down like Tetris
No telling where an 80 proof gets us

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]

I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

[Outro]
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I"

I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

That money be callin'
I don't do no talkin', so get the fuck outta my face
Gotta TEC and a chopper
With a hundred thousand dollars up in the Wraith
You know I ain't slippin', you know that I'm with it
I'll shoot him right up in his face
Three say that I'm trippin', you know that I'm drippin'
I'm wrapped in Saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from Goyard, I ain't put it on yet
I don't care 'bout no bitch, I ain't giving her shit
Spend it all on my homies
I go put on my son, from my car to my house
Everything, I own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stuntin'
I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin', you know I won't fight him

Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body

Got rid of my Glock and I bought me a rifle

Right now I'm recordin' with ten thousand on me
He say he want smoke but I know he don't want it
Shoot him and his bitch and I up on his homie
You know how I'm feelin', I don't got to say it
Face every problem all by my lonely

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real, I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck, want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends

I'm still trapping every day, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout, get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl, but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a pornstar, a rockstar
Tryna skrrt off in that fast car like NASCAR
Girl, you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart?
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki, yeah, she like it sloppy
Oh, you got a hottie body, come ride on my johnny
I'ma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste?
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights, I'm flyin', no, you can't see me
Say you need me, but you deceive me

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need (World that you need)
We get high to pass time, but bitch, I ain't no fiend (I ain't no fiend)

Said I ain't never forgotten not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
'Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a goddamn rockstar
That blunt ash on the floor
Well, she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know, toke
Took a drag out that 'Wood, now she goin' for my wood
So we goin' to my hood, yeah, she gonna get it good
Yeah, she know who we are
She want this rockstar life, and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah, she off a bar, and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more"
294,No NameNF,"[Verse]
Look, people ask me what the future is
All I know is I'll be doin' this
All I know is things are moving quick
That's convenient for me 'cause that's how I live
Now they see me out here movin' up
You don't like me, that makes two of us
Time change, yeah, I can't adjust
Yo, it’s who you are not who you was, oh my
Yeah, just went to Europe, they said the single is working
I think I'm learning
I am way more than what people might think when they look on the surface
What is my purpose? Yeah
That is a question that I have been asking myself and it hurts
'Cause it's prolly something I should already know but I don’t know it yet, I'm tryna grow as a person, woo!
I'm sick of people tellin' people I'm here 'cause of marketing dollars, oh
You think that everything is gonna blow just 'cause you market it harder? No
I got my hands in everything, now they out here tryna get to me, stop tryna lecture me
You don't compare to my level of thinking, so why do you think you compare to my energy, huh?
Small circle, but the number's growin'
Fame called me, I'm like, ""How you doin'?""
Hung up on him, I ain't ready for it
I'll get back to that when I make album four
Less talkin', I've been workin' more
Better me is what I'm workin' towards
Y'all judgin', but we not in court, no, we not in court, oh Lord!
Last couple years, let's recap
I make a livin' off of writin' out my regrets
I'm doin' me, I don't care where the scene's at
Try to give me feedback, I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo!
Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at 83
I've been doin' this since ABCs
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo!
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every morning thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Park then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof! And I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what!?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean, where do I start?
Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard
I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God
Sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not
Comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got
I give it all that I got!
I'm tryna think out the box, no!
Yeah, I got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don't smile in VIPs, you get mad like, ""You know what I paid?""
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say
I leave it all on the stage
I leave it all on the stage"

Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC-10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum

Throw me off, I be, ""Off ya head""

Who gon' be there for my sons the day that I'm not around?

I hope you love me as much as I love you

If it go down now, I know Baby Joe gon' shoot
If you go broke now they ain't gon' do shit for you
Can't give up now, nigga this the life I choose

Back in 8th grade, I swear I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made it through the rain baby

[Verse 1]
Before the fame, I was strapped up on Valley Park with a Glock
I was sellin' them rocks, these police stay watchin' steady passin' by the block
I created that gang, forever I bang, nigga I'll never stop
I stay in my lane, I'm never gon' change, nigga playin', he get popped
I told him record me, I go safari, diamonds wetter than some water
Hellcat not a Charger, way faster than a 'Rari (skrt)
I'm turnin' up in the party, celebratin' all the shit that I did
I told my momma I'm a gangster, I'll never change the way that I live (nah)

Gone off that molly, I'm zooted and booted
Got snake on my collar, I tell you it's Gucci
I swear that I'm bout it, you play I'ma shoot it
I'm a 38 baby I swear that I'm ruthless
Walkin' on stage, I'm strapped with a toolie

I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breathe
Want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
If your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
One whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cause I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!

[Verse 4: Yhung T.O. & Kendrick Lamar]
And I been really tryna keep the peace
But I'm a north Vallejo nigga, and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my grannie and the gangsters
So at 8 I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win 'cause I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call, I'm the man for the task
You ain't standin' for the cause, meet the man in the mask"

King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated

King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion

Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?

[Outro]
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
KING! KING! KING! KING! KING!

Told 'em, ""Go on, take a shot on three""
Told 'em, ""Drinks is on me""
Yeah, the drinks are on me

Only drug a bitch is on is the tree
But I lasted ten rounds like a freak

Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say

I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

You tell me you love me
But I ain't been feeling it lately
You say you love keeping me fly but
Can't keep me from looking' so crazy
Come in at 6 in the mornin'
Where you been, where you been?
Who is that texting your phone?
Just a friend, just a friend (okay)
My intuition never lies
There's nothing you can ever hide
Already got the screenshots
So there is no need to deny
You been creepin' and freakin' and sneakin'
Like you'll never lose me
Steady claiming that everyone know we together
But you steady choosing

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear I cannot win for losing
I been out here being faithful
I always got this on lockdown
But that ain't been keeping us stable
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine (hey, yeah)

[Chorus]
How would you like it if I do the things you do?
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
Give another guy everything that belongs to you
I'ma call up Brian, I'ma FaceTime Ryan
I'ma text Lorenzo and, I'ma leave you cryin'
Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you (same to you)

[Verse 2]
You don't like it
Now you telling' me that I should fight it
Why you be out here playing the victim
When I am the one who been cryin'
Why dish it out but can't take it
I want revenge, I can't fake it
Wanna see the look on your face
When I drop my clothes and I get naked
Not for you, but for him
Now tell me player, how does that make you feel?
How could you play me when the love I gave was real
I even took you back and you still had no chill

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy you ain't gone ever learn
Play with fire you get burned
I don't think you'll understand
Until I hit you where it hurts
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine

How would you like it if I do the things you do?
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
Give another guy everything that belongs to you

Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you (same to you)

I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion

Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

339,Kevin's HeartJ. Cole,"[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying

I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that

How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?

How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit

Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby

Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him

344,Call Out My NameThe Weeknd,"[Verse 1]
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

[Verse 2]
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

[Pre-Chorus]
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you so gently (Ohh)
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?

Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me"

Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down

Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float

[Verse: J. Cole]
Yeah, I got some niggas that still owe me an apology
I'ma be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now that's hard for me
I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily ""Why you not with me?""
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

348,BracketsJ. Cole,"[Intro: Richard Pryor]
Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
""Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made""
You know what he'd say? ""You's a lying motherfucker
Joe Louis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit,"" hah

[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say ""No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that""
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
It's been a long time since I have felt this way
About something but now, but now
I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void

[Interlude]
Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
""What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said ""Democracy is too fuckin' slow""
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

350,Window Pain (Outro)J. Cole,"[Intro]
One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Verse]
Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, ""Don't forget me""
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Outro]
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world
K.O.D
Choose wisely!"

When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it

[Verse: J. Cole]
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

352,Once An Addict (Interlude)J. Cole,"[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)"

Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here go some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench

Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a ho from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, ""Why you got an attitude?""

To my surprise, He replied, said, ""You made for this""
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
""#CardiBIsSoProblematic"" is the hashtag

They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash

But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy

Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: ""Yes, indeed""

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy

38 Baby

[Verse]
Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to hell, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin'
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow
What's the 4-1-1, they know I be, I be 'bout whatever
You ain't got no bodies, you ain't 'bout it, boy you are not a stepper
You play with me, bitch ain't no hidin', ain't nobody can help you
Send your ass to the devil, in an envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it
It's all bronze like a penny, only see fire when I spit it
I ain't shoot this bitch in a minute, a nigga play, he can get it
Double G, that stand for gang, you niggas know how we livin'"

Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati; next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?

In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got ""Malone"" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden

Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah

Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith
Made a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?
Rolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'
Introverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business

Making Salat, I ain't miss a beat
Praise to Allah, made it out the clink
Alhamdulillah, praise be to God
Big booty freak, givin' a massage
Lookin' in the mirror, lookin' at a star
She get on her knees and look up at a star
Remember being broke, wishin' on a star
Out the mud, no one givin' us a start
White gold, iced out, Audemars
Foreign car, push button, autostart
Rest and relaxation not involved, goin' hard Rolls Royce, R&R
Wonder why these niggas hate me?
Probably 'cause they know they ain't me
I ain't never been a gang member, Illinois labeled me a gang chief
Political spear, Judge Linehan racist, I’m bein' sentenced
Wrongful conviction, broke bread and lied to me
Gave him a quarter ticket, he did not appeal it
Layin' in my cell, lookin' at the ceiling
I'm on a division, me and all the killers
Throwin' shit and piss on all the staff members
Even got the warden, that’s why they had to ship us

Fresh yams, politic'n with family

Makin' music, but I'm really a trapper
Booty club, 'bout to fuck up a sandwich
A hundred bands, if you ain't catch him, what's happenin'?

Switch place, story stay the same

Keep it professional when you DM me
You know your sister be all in my business, copyin' everythin' that I delivered

Breakin' open a pipe, pourin' dope in the cup, partner bought it, 'bout to open it up
Big Body, doors openin' up, big Jamaican unloadin' the truck
Big weight 'bout to go in the trunk, bad bitch, give me brain in the trunk
Just jugg, four M in a month, two-fifty book a show, I'ma come
Cappin' like they got more than us, matter of fact, I just ordered up
Shopliftin', they recorded us, 'member back on the MARTA bus
I could remember you treatin' me shitty back then 'cause I wasn't important enough
Straight from the back, how I'm grippin' the bitch, throwin' dick in her kidney, she ballin' up
In the mirror I glisten', the button ignition, the engine go RAH, when I start it up

Everybody's bosses 'til it's time to pay for the office
'Til them invoices separate the men, from the boys
Over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you
Here we say you broke if everybody is broke except for you
Boss!

Ain't nothing to it, real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) boss (boss, boss, boss)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) I boss
Ohhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Ain't nothing to it, I bossed up out my momma whip
My great-great-grandchildren already rich
That's a lot of brown chil'ren on your Forbes list
Frolickin' around my compound on my fortress, boss (boss, boss, boss)
Ohh, I be ridin' 'round with my seat reclinin'
Droppin' my daughter off at school every morning
We slammin' car doors
I be true ballin' on these bum whores
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothing, I ain't got no time, boss
Chill, tell them paps they gotta relax (you tried it!)
Toes in the sand, momma gettin' fat (snack)

The cab is the cabinet, they trust me at landing it
They call me the advocate, they'll slide like the abacus
Boy meets world, everybody been savages
I just want to really know how much that your shooter averages
I'm not no nice guy, I'm just the good guy
The bad guys should really stay on my good side
I smelled my roses younger than the good die
The Illuminati couldn't see me with they good eye
They think they Heath Ledger scary, they just Jack Nichols
I'm a sign to my city like the Bat-Signal
Young chosen one, golden boy, De La Hoya
It ain't too many me's, rest in peace to Verne Troyer
I was younger than I seemed as a kid
I mean my G17 18 in the head
I mean I'm only 25 but I'm Motown 25
Bet I get a statue in my hometown when I die

I missed a Crain's interview, they tried leaking my addy
I donate to the schools next, they call me a deadbeat daddy
The Sun-Times gettin' that Rauner business
I got a hit-list so long I don't know how to finish
I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business
Speaking of racist, fuck your microaggressions
I'll make you fix your words like a typo suggestion
Pat me on the back too hard and Pat'll ask for your job
And in unrelated news, someone'll beat your ass at your job
I'm the real deal
Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal?
Inherited the earth, popping wheelies on a big wheel
My enemy lives in his mother's basement
That's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement
I'm a real one
The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter
They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her
And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter
I know the devil's a liar
I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters
I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return
So I just hire a sitter
I'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier
Kingdom builder, man somebody shoulda told ya

Lil' boy, I'm your father, hakuna matata
I made that girl give all of that top up
Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose on my chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Lil Uzi Vert]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (Yeah)
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted

[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD & Lil Uzi Vert]
She do cocaine in my basement (In my basement)
I'm a doctor, but I'm runnin' out of patience (Out of patience)
She told me that she tryna get closer to Satan (Satan)
She be talkin' to him when she in the matrix

[Verse 3: Juice WRLD]
My eyes closed, hopin' this ain't make-believe
And she don't know that all her demons live in me, yeah
I don't know, I don't know
Don't know what she been on, I don't know
All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends
I'm an open door, I ain't have to let her in
She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Lil Uzi Vert]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (Yeah)
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted

409,LieNF,"[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us (Woo)
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night
Then, tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no, I'm the one that made you rich
When I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us
So I guess I don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours of the night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 2]
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah, that we was barely speakin'
Ah, that's kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend
Tellin' me you missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me, ""We should let it go and put it all behind us""
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk—then why you callin', huh?

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes

Ahhhhhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–

All they liked to do was talk, when I knew that I was next
I just come up with these hits and lay low, collect my checks
She fuck with solid niggas (ayy)
She don't be fuckin' with broke boys, I ran it up, that was my choice
She call me up when she need pipe, my girl ain't playin' with no toys
Watch my back, niggas lurkin', my girl look better in person
And she still picture perfect, ooh, dip and dash when we swervin'
Oh me, oh my (oh my)
Put my hand on your thighs (your thighs)
If I come through tonight (tonight)
I'll make you touch the sky (the sky)
Don't need to wink my eye (my eye)
No, I'm not even playin' (I'm not playin')
You know just what I'm sayin' (what I'm sayin')
Got you and all your cravings

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Blame on me, no, shame on you (on you)
No, you can't hide the truth
I'ma slide right through your roof (your roof)
Might pop a pill or two
Let them hate, we chuck the deuce (the deuce)
Fuck that, we gettin' loose
Pussy sweeter than some juice (some juice)
I slurp it like it's soup
Ayy, she a naughty type on the weekend
Perfect night, she gon' let me start to creep in
Baby goin' offense, I'm playin' defense
You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Hold my wrist up out the coupe, two bitches switch-a-roo
That pussy good, I'm blamin' you, you drippin', shame on you
She got real water (water), head real smarter (head)
Think that bitch from Florida (Florida), you probably can't afford her (no)
Bentley truck might park the coupe (skrr), I'm livin' comfortable
Told money then I'm stuck with you, no, I'm in love with you
Plug pull up in the UFO, no small talk, I'm the CEO
My bitches is bad, they do the most
She way too foreign, straight off the boat
I put her on top, she leakin', she leakin'
Turn to a freak on the weekend, the weekend
Blame on me, no, shame on you, girl, you can't hide the truth
I might get a 'Rari coupe, but just to flex on you

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Blame on me, no, shame on you (on you)
No, you can't hide the truth
I'ma slide right through your roof (your roof)
Might pop a pill or two
Let them hate, we chuck the deuce (the deuce)

Perfect night, she gon' let me start to creep in

You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh"
413,ElevateDrake,"[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse: Drake & French Montana]
If you need me, you can't call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (Bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'"

Eyes barely open, not never smokin'

Trained to go, my chain, it glow
Everything you see, I paid for
Gang or croak

You wanna know what it's like to be famous
Rollin' up weed in public (in public)

Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds

I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (Bad kidneys)

Stop tryna be God Almighty
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes

Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still, still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you"

[Chorus]

Bitches bad, yeah, they all migrate
And she said ""Lil Uzi so great (Great)

I looked at her, ""Oh, hey"" (Hello)
You ain't never seen pastry dough
Well lil' bitch, I got cake (Yeah)
Gettin' money, I'm the man
Gettin' money, had to count the advance
Saint Laurent on my shoes, these not Vans
Need a fan case a nigga get hot
'Member she ain't want me back, I was popped
On the block back before I had locks (Yeah)
Red dot for a chicken, he popped
MC told the bitch eat my cock
Motorcycle days, bitch, Yung Joc
That's what I call her, she all on my top
Rap star or do he sell rock?
He got files so he beatin' the trial
Couple racks and them niggas run wild
Super filthy, man, they livin' so foul

Tryna shade the bar just for the foul
All these hackers, yeah, these niggas is foul
All my bitches want me to take a vow
Live off verbs, and I live off of nouns
He get money, then I had to say, ""How?""
New rug, and it's made out of wolf
New rabbit, yeah, I use as a towel
Lil' bitch, yeah, I run through the city
Different spots in it just like a cow
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout a mansion, no house
Yeah, my closet, yeah, that shit got a house
Four years, I ain't even see a mouse
Please stop talkin', bitch, put dick in your mouth
We get money, what the fuck is a drought?
Make it rain 'cause I'm up in the clouds
Had to tell that lil' bitch, get from around
'Cause that little bitch be fuckin' with clowns

[Verse 3]
Let's go, let's go, had to tell that lil' bitch, yeah, let's go (Let's go, let's go)
That lil' nigga stole my swag and he tried to steal my flow (My flow, my flow)
I had to switch it up one time just like I switch my phone (My phone, my phone)
I could try one more time, I can give this shit one more go (Let's go, ayy)
I put hundreds in my safe (Ayy)
I throw twenties in her face (Ayy)
I put the M in a J (Ayy)
I got a bae in the Bay (Ayy)

Look at my neck, that's an ice tray
Come on tell me, what you sayin'?

430,Lucky YouEminem,"[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"
431,Rap DevilMachine Gun Kelly,"[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny

[Verse 1]
Ayy, somebody grab him some clippers (Zzzzt)
His fuckin' beard is weird
Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
""I think my dad's gone crazy,"" yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be 46 years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout ""I'ma call up Trick Trick""
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck ""Rap God,"" I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it (Ayy!)

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper
That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go on Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' 50
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff?
When you the one that called Diddy (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the G.O.A.T
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brra!)
Don't have a heart attack now (No)
Somebody help your mans up (Help!)
Knees weak of old age, The Real Slim Shady can't stand up!

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it

[Verse 3]
Hello Marshall, my name's Colson
You should go back to Recovery (Wouh)
I know your ego is hurtin'
Just knowin' that all of your fans discovered me (Hi!)
He like, ""Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me.""
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me!
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy!)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (Pussy)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Facts)
I said on Flex anyone could get it
I ain't know it would be you

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it

[Bridge]
Ayy, ridin' shotty 'cause I gotta roll this dope
It's a fast road when your idols become your rivals, yeah
Never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm a asshole
Bitch-ass motherfucker
Oh my God, Ronny
Fuck Kells!

[Verse 4]
We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr!)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you! (Thank you!)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy!)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh!)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim!

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it"
432,FallEminem,"[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!""—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Ha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch (Yeah)

Gettin’ money nigga that’s my main focus
Wit .223 and you act like you don’t know this
Bro popped a bean man my niggas always rollin'"
435,The RingerEminem,"[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date."" — ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"

Man, fuck all y'all (Just come wit' me)
Everything I do is for us only (Yeah, yeah)
Only us, none of y'all other niggas (I know none of y'all can't tell)
It's on God
(I'm in London, got my beat from London)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, ayy, I'm drippin' again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz
Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith & Young Thug]
I poured a four from the clouds down
And my head floating in bliss (Goddamn)
I'm on the phone with big bro now (Damn)
He told me keep Benz on the race (Goddamn)
Until you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists
Straight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch
Man we never miss, okay (God)
'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up
We ain't takin' no pictures
See all the wings in the front, it's us
We had to triple the digits
See all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man
We had to grant all they wishes (We grants-)
Casamigos got me spinnin'
But I want some spendin' some out wit' some dealers
Let's go (Goddamn)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm rocking Dior Sauvage (Damn)
I'm higher than Scotty, they calling me Pippen (God)
I got some Cartier vision, it costs me six thousand
I'm watchin' these women
Money's the reason I'm sinning
Money's the reason I gotta take Ritalin
You niggas don't care 'bout women
Just shut the fuck up, yeah I'm taking care plenty
I put Chanel on a belt buckle, of when my price is half off
I keep a stick for my cover, got way more girls than Hugh Hefner
Got the same name as the butler
But more money than Ashley and her mother
Got a backwood full of sherbert, I'm 'bout to smoke like a murder

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, ayy, I'm dripping again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz
Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins

I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
Ooh, hop out the back of the turn up
Avoid all the cameras, I did it on purpose
She tryna act like she perfect
I see all the masks that you leave on the surface
She made me write all my verses in cursive
She need all them purses at Hermès
That's like 25 racks and we always on a roll
Man, we always working, let's go

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Ay, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti
It's going down my back
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby, girl you can pick
Rocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night
I spent half a million designer on kits
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby girl you can pick
I got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear
I met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream
I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Straight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express

[Outro: Young Thug]
I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Straight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express
I'm in London, got my beat from London"

Yessir

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Thug nigga from the trenches never had a heart
Drug dealer, contract killer, loyal from the start (Start)

They say I'm pussy and they say I'm fake but I say

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Got into it with my bitch, caught up while I'm tourin'
Tryna see if shawty on my dick, wonder what she doin'
You know me, real G, I text ask her, ""How it's goin'""
She responded nothin', lookin' like to me you havin' fun
Look for my mama when I try to look inside my woman
Told my bae, ""I wish I woulda found you back when I was bummin'""
Stayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'
Time passed over now you see that I was chasin' money
Posted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once
Know you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'
Nigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny
Damn what you sayin' gangsta, you gon' make me take it from you
Some hoes say I'm handsome, some of them they say I'm ugly
Some say that I'm the realest but I still ain't sayin' nothin'
'Cause

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
I upgraded from nobody to the one who the man, yeah (To the man, yeah)
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 3: Quando Rondo]
Tryna run me up a check, late nights, early mornings
Diamonds 'round my neck, they really wet, I could've copped a foreign
Givenchy shoes, I came a long way from Ralph Lauren
Cut off my ex because my new bitch put that pussy on me
They watchin' every move I make, I guess I'm settin' trends
I had to focus on the check, told myself, ""Fuck a friend""
Committed crimes so many times but I don't give a damn
I are who you say I am
Posted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'
Convicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'
No drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin
Can't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them Heaven gates
She ain't never really made love, I'm him just like Kevin Gates

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
20 of 'em comin', I switched to another spot
Reversible stock carbon, a new convertible drop
I was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block
I tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot
I ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales
Don't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well
The 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils
Millionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail
I graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel (yeah, yeah)
Aux is outta reach, I'ma move the race car (Vroom)
Hated on us and they know who they are
Still livin' large as I aim for the stars
I'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums
I got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm
If I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong
Surrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch
I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Tell that curb boy Trell I love you with all my heart
Now we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start (vroom)

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Cause I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh

Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
Yeah, ayy, look

[Verse 1: Drake & Gunna]
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, ""Fuck it"", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me ""No"" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

You seen the overseas drip?"
441,Mona LisaLil Wayne,"[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him""
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothin', keep restin'""
She say, ""What's missin'?"", ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed""
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say—ooh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!""
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told ya""
She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Uh)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do? [sniffing]
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah"

443,VenomEminem,"[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em

(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

Ayy, ayy, air it out
Pull up at your spot, and I air it out
Gang on the gas and it's very loud
Stop sayin' my name before you wear it out
I been sippin' lean, tryna slow me down
I need me a bitch that'll hold me down
Gang comin' strong, yeah we rollin' out
Throw a party like Rollin' Loud
Ayy, don't come unless she stay in focus
Soldiers at 10-4, sent your bitch the info
Feelin' real blessed with Juice, that's my kinfolk
Bless up, she tell me I'm a god, get on her knees for confession
Sent a vid to her nigga, had to teach a lesson
Me and Boat only want bad hoes in our section
Juice, why these pussy ass niggas always pressin'?
I don't know, let 'em talk, I'ma go get my Smith & Wesson
Blessed boys under 21, steady flexin'

Well if she goin' like that, let's run a train then
Fuck, I think I nutted in her, I might need a playpen
And a stroller
How I get this deep? We rode her like a Rover
No games, but I XBOX control her
She do the gang like a nerd doin' homework
.40 in my pants, that bitch thought it was a boner
If I go broke, I'ma juug off Motorolas

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)

Huh, ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one
Savage, I ain't even hatin'""
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage, I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 2]
So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga, my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know, they bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am

Ooh, she hit the splits, she know how to party
When I'm with my clique, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's party, party, party like a nigga just got out of jail
Flyin' in my 'rari like a bat that just flew outta hell
I'm from the east of ATL, but ballin' in the Cali hills
Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still
I'm tryna fuck, who tryna chill? 'Cause I'm just tryna pay some bills
I'm multi millionare LaFlare, this watch here cost a quarter M
Just look at me and look at them, I smashed her on my first attempt
Like Scarface bitch, the world is mine, you should read the blimp
So either you gon' take a ride, or you gon' stay with him
'Cause I got places I can be, I get yo ass on the scene
Gucci, CB VIP, so fuck them niggas, look at me, Wop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry (Sorry)
Hundred on my wrist, jumpin' out the 'rari (Jump, jump, jump, jump)
Ooh, she hit the splits, she know how to party (She, yeah)
When I'm with my clique, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party"

Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot

Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie

My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA""
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen..."

This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga (Yeah)

She was playin' with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (mansion)
I was fightin' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (blastin')

486,ChangeJ. Cole,"[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—"

I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down, uh
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

[Verse]
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
Lord

[Chorus]
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

Bells gettin' louder, louder

493,Six Feet UnderThe Weeknd,"[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'til she

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy

Real love's hard to find

You ain't gon' catch her crying

'Til she..

[Outro: Future & The Weeknd]
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper ('Til she)

494,ReminderThe Weeknd,"[Verse 1]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Lo mein)

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)

Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause—

[Chorus]
You know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey)
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)

[Bridge]
Why don't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Big girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin' (Shake some)
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some (Work), work somethin'
For the Don? don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

495,SidewalksThe Weeknd,"[Intro: The Weeknd]
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down

And they don't let me down

Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you

Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
(""You soft!"")

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good

Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say ""I love you""
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
""Damn, what's gotten into you?""
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright"

For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only"

We bought all the bottles, we came with the models

I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'

Mm, CP Dubb
Bitch, I'm really timeless
Let me beat it up like Jaegen

[Verse 1]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...

[Refrain]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, ""I love you"", I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

[Verse 2]
I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road

Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this

Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless

Bitches in my ear, they saying they love me
Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fucking slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitioning to my inner, I'm hearing their voice
Tell me stay in focus, keep focusing, boy
Feeling like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixing fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, setting off my groupie radar
Sipping Hen', dapping hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say ""keep it going""
All my youngins, they dumb and repping, they always knowing

Got some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Aye, aye, nightmares kept a nigga from closing his lids
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant the haunted ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are coming for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxing, I'm whippin'
Last week I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefing good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie is so rock 'n' roll
My princess Vada know rock 'n' roll daddy got the glow

Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4"" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga"

Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it

Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this

Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this

Mmm, you see, you see these fine bitches over here?

You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

I ain't been gettin' high
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters (Facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (Facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

She said she 21, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: KYLE]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife

I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times

I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now

Lost up in the system

But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy

I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back

Feature money out the safe, went and brought a Wraith, brought it down Collins
Niggas talkin' like they want it, when we in the city, they don't want problems
Niggas said they gon' rob us
But nigga, we comin' from welfare
I shoot a mullet when I pull it, how you catch a bullet like a NFL player?
Should've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick
Lie on that pussy like I hit
Can't even be a side, side bitch
I'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5
Broke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!
I'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime
Rolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline
Niggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them
See, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions
I just counted up a Quentin Miller
A ""QM,"" that's a quarter milli
They don't wanna see Jae drop ""6,"" fly private when he go to Philly
Funny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me
When I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it
I promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]

I'm with my team, and we goin' up (Goin' up)
All of these foreigns, they know it's us (Ah!)
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it

Perfect timin' and we're blowin' up (Blowin' up)
Fuck it, I'ma light the Rollie up (Rollie up)
Shorty fuckin' for Chanel!
I ain't trippin', that's a coconut (Coconut)
Push the 'Rari 'til the motor bust
Stack the paper, fill the sofa up (Woo)
Lay on that paper, I am not slackin', I stay on that paper
I feel like it's a restraining order on that money, 'cause y'all stay away from that paper
I know some niggas that used to be ballin', but know they all feeling a way 'bout this paper
I be spending hundred, hundred, hundred after hundred
They thought I was makin' this paper!
Fuckin' it good, I be rapin' this paper
Shit, I might as well get married to money
I marry Nicki, still married to money
She rich as Mariah, I carry the money
And fuck a deposit, I bury the money (Bury them M's)
I bag the money, it hang out my pocket, embarrassin' money
I act like I ain't used to havin' this money, oh!

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad
They don't wanna see the Wraith

I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face

I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I’m in a damn cell
I’m in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don’t go that way

Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I’m Derek Jeter
Growing up with no father, it’ll make you evil
How he gon’ learn to be a man when you ain’t never teach him?
Youngin’ can’t even read but he totin’ the Desert Eagle

Everything 1K

[Verse 2]
I probably thank God ‘cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Jailbird, I was caged in, he came and set me free
I was just on the news, now I’m on MTV
Hurting ‘cause your people ate and you ain’t get a piece
Now you’re taking from your people plate ‘cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a combo
My mama need a crib, I been thinking ‘bout a condo
You nothing when you down, it’s crazy how people treat you
Come around now, you can’t even hit the reefer
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
Brother from the same struggle, cut from the same cloth

I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day

All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

[Verse 2]
You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’ma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me so amazing

531,Losin ControlRuss,"[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

Uh, list of my problems
Got this one in my bed and she just wants to sleep
Fucking up all of the sheets

Do this shit every week

Crying you want to be great, but sleepin' until the next day
Why you do that?
Don't got that much in the bank, we go out she order the steak
Why you do, why you do that?
She can't explain it but just know it working for her
She claiming she down on her luck but really she don't give a fuck
And I cannot make this shit up
And I ain't did shit but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I won't be the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels, I'ma sip on this drank, it's easing the pain

Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions!""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions!""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 1]
I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet pap-er
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions!""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 2]
I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, ""Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!""
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' door

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions!""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'

They wanna see you in the penitentiary

I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop ""Another One"", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
""Back to Back""? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like ""nah""

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, ""Alright, alright, alright""
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, ""Babe, I think I love you, kinda""
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana, Weezy, he get honored
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, word"

It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah

If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em

Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you
You

[Verse 1]
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Two seats in my two seater-er-er
Used to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt
Tryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt
Not nice, boy you know you do your dirt

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em

Baby now you know you got nerve
I know you just wanna be heard
I'm a bad bitch, you ain't used to that
You gon' fuck around and make me do you bad
Used to creep, creep, with you through the back
I count up the cash and bring you the bag
I count up the racks like Serena
Plus I got that ass like Selena
And you know nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, not a bitch
That's gon' care, care, hold you down and love you like this
Drop down, turn around, baby show you like this
Won't find another one to ride it like a soldier like this

'Cause you don't even know what you just lost
You don't even know what you just had
You don't even know, and that's what's bad
Money bag long, that bitch bad
Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white
Now you spendin' cold nights
You've been in the wrong so long
You don't even know right
Call my line, call my line, I'm like, ""Please, boy""
You just need to leave, boy
I ain't got time for you
Just once, do somethin' for me, boy

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em

I did it for everybody out here on their own
I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages
And never tell me no
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong
But you should know I bought 'em
I changed it, I changed it
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though
I changed it, I changed it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they on the same shit
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they still on the same shit
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
The big 3 on the court, bitch at them bleachers
I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches
A bitch out in Atlanta eating them peaches
A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread dissin' Nicki like Lisa hair
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stopped doin' pills, but bitch dem withdrawals
I am in my mansion rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switched flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and the bitch is my son
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run
MJ, game 6, (you my) Jackson, Tyson

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up

These bum bitches never change up

I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

No more CMB shit, I changed it
Young Money shit, Mula Gang shit
Different hoes doing the same shit
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em ""Let's beef""
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes
Me, Minaj, and Champagne changed the game
And y'all chump change
I'm just sayin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up
And when I come, get your change cup
These bum bitches never change up

Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they on the same
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they on the same
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't

Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

Amazing, the cash online unknown

Yacht cruisin' in the deep
I'm twisted up, I got geeked
Misbehaving with your freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn

Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (no videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too (keep comin')
Told me, ""Boy I think the money startin' to change you""

I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies

Dress up your talk if a nigga wanna talk to me
Fuck your phone calls, I don't want apologies

I think the belts inside the store look better on my waist
I think my nuts look better on her face
This bitch got addicted, all she did was take a taste
Now you gettin' mad because you got replaced
The brown boy and the Starboy on a track
Haters gonna say ""this shit is wack""
I went to the hills straight from the trap
I'ma fuck your bitch and give her back
She said she pop pills, I told her ""Stop it""
Check my little pocket, I got options
I'm the first brown boy to get it poppin'
If I say the word, my shooters gonna pop 'em

Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects

I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head

Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gon' plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate

Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate

That is not your swag, I swear you fakin'
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (Yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, ""You're the worst, you're the worst""
I cannot die because this my universe

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge"

Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it’s premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I’m established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I’m alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
I'm a savage, I'm an asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain’t no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri

Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa
I'll chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin', I'll chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin', I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!,"" X-rated

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it

I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there

Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care

Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately, I'm not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chastise you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom"
564,Blood.Kendrick Lamar,"[Intro: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
""Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it.""
She replied: ""Oh yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life.""

{Gunshot}

[Bridge: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?

Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

[Bridge]
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous

[Chorus]
This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, ""A-ha!""
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, ""A-ha!""

Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy

Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (ooh)

I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry

Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats

Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, ""How is niggas really gettin' down?""
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

[Bridge: Ted Taylor (Sampled)]
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

571,First Day OutTee Grizzley,"[Intro]
Helluva made this beat, baby

[Chorus]
These niggas prayed on my downfall (They what?)
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse]
Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, 'member when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan though, ayy, Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-Boom-Boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

[Chorus]
I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall

I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down

[Verse]
I ain’t here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I’m just here to spread the clues
I’m just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain’t ashamed to be white
I ain’t ashamed to be Black
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don’t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don’t know what's up
What's up, what's up

Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck

She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white

I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax

Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through

I gave you real love out the gutter (Out the gutter)
Ever let you go, you gon' suffer (You gon' suffer from it)

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas (Shottas)
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)

[Outro: Khalid & Future]
Yeah, L-O-V-E on my right leg
Nah Hendrix overload, dig what I'm sayin'?
I feel like I should be giving up
You can leave if it's too much
But I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no
I don't like where this shit is going
I mean I've been stuck in all your apologies
Gave my all but you want more from me
Keep your love, it doesn't feel the same
I hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name"

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind

It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"

Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice
Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right

Yo' intuition has been tellin' you
Things that you never knew (never knew)
Rubbing shoulders with bitches I used to put on pedestals
But still I keep it professional
Hey, laying in the bed and you acting like I can't even touch you
I don't know why you do that
Shower with the door open, why you do that?
Drop the towel right in front of me, you cruel
What's goin' on, baby, talk to me, baby
Say it to me straight, did I make a mistake?
And I can't concentrate while you're standing there naked
Acting strange, yeah, yeah, yeah

My intuition has been telling me
Trust what you said to me
You ain't never really felt love 'til you slept with me
I'm busy, it's no wonder you upset with me
You found a Magnum inside of my bag
Don't know how to explain this
That was in there way before we started dating
This the only music I hate facing, oh
Lay down, baby, I'ma take it slow
Can't let this thing go to waste, oh no
Before we crash, hit the brakes, oh no
Call, then I got to your place, oh no
Still getting voicemail, oh no
Fuck it, leave a voicemail, oh no

I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now

Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

Yeah, I'm the only young nigga who poppin' that
Got it jumpin' out the heat, they're like, ""Who coppin' that?""
New G Wagon got her braggin', put a lock on that
Niggas always hit her DM, she don't holla back, woo, woo, copy that
Cuffin', I've been cuffin'
Chanel bags like it's nothin', and she love them
Her last nigga, he was bluffin', she said, ""Fuck him""
He let that go, I'm like, ""He buggin,'"" now she thuggin' with a real one
I've been ballin' on you 'cause you smart and loyal
All my homies know me best, they say I'm fallin' for you
And that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
And I'll be there long as you there when I be callin' for you, facts

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, as long as you, wrap your arms 'round me
Ooh, baby I don't care what them people say

Girl, you know I can provide
Whatever you need (whatever you need, babe)
Listen to your heart, baby

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, you can get whatever you want, whatever you need
Got a one-way flight 'cause I ain't lettin' you leave
We ain't fuck first night, had me beggin' you please
But you love when I'm beggin', you told me get on my knees
And I ate it, we got faded
You said, ""Put some Tory Lanez on"" and I played it
In Philly, we say you the main jawn and we save it
Finally got a rich nigga, baby, you made it
Long as you hold me down, you know that it's goin' down
Be there when I turn around and I'll turn your world around
I had to tone it down 'cause you made me slow it down
But I got you open now so I'm 'bout to show you now, show you now

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
What makes you think that I would try to run a game on you?
Just as sure as my name is Dolla
I'll be there for you and I'll
Treat you just like a queen and give you fine things
You'll never have to worry 'bout another in your place
So believe me when I say

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, as long as you, wrap your arms 'round me
Ooh, baby I don't care what them people say
I'm givin' you whatever you want
Girl, you know I can provide
Whatever you need (whatever you need, babe)
Listen to your heart, baby"

Off top, run a nigga out his socks
Niggas talk more than bitches
Niggas really be on cock though (Pussy)
Just fucked a ho out in France
Paint her face like Picasso
I iced out my vatos, I'm really up
Big ass Bimmer, big Benz and my Bentley next
Don't play around on my phone ho, gimme sex
Watch on my wrist out of date, but it's Rolex
Grizzley up next, I'm up now
Strap your bullet vest

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
500 50's, 600 hundreds
700 20's, let's get straight to it
800 10's, what's that, 8 bands?
Hit the store and get some rubber bands
Let's get straight to it
Everybody come together, everybody got the plan
He came with you
So if he steal it fall on you, we on your ass
Have your mans call his mans
Make sure they ain't movin' fast
Soon as they touch Atlanta, get with Boat
Secure the bag, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Oh, A bag secure, that's on my mama, bro
Asian lil' ho, she ride that dick, Yokohama flow
Made that shit double, got an Uzi, I don't scuffle
Not a banger but that banger in my car like an airbag
Niggas only aimin' in the sky, call those Air Mags
All up in Neiman's, coppin' shit like fuck a price tag
I'm ballin', ain't near a rap nigga in the game that I'm callin'
If I need help, I'll dial it by my se-kelf

[Verse 4: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
You swear your bitch faithful, she sent her location
I hit her at the trap in Decatur, she basic (Crazy)
Chop with the laser, get decapitated
Can't smoke, I'm on papers
Hold on, this my Jamaican (Love one)
Niggas want me dead, so I'm steady prayin'
Ain't no disrespect without retaliation
Fuck a hotel, I hit her in the basement
Text her later like, ""I'm done with you, I got a situation, baby""

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Hmmmm! Well shit, bro, let me get her then
I'ma dog her out then switcheroo into the lion's den
Nigga talkin' down, my bro got more heat than a fryin' pan
Gucci 'round my hair, wrapped tight like I'm Taliban

[Verse 6: Tee Grizzley]
Like I'm Taliban, how we drop shit (We go)
Lot of dreadheads, lot of chopsticks
Touch my nigga Yachty, get your top ripped (boop!)
Don't ask the price if you know you ain't tryna cop shit

[Verse 7: Lil Yachty]
You the type to look around but never cop shit, ayy
I'm the type to buy the store, make them restock it, ayy
Beam on everythin' I own, I will not miss
Grizzley by my side like a pilot ridin' cockpit

[Verse 8: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
Yachty, I might stop rappin' for this one reason (Oh, for real?)
If the Feds hear this shit I'm doin' a hundred seasons
In the hood, shootin' craps in my Yeezys
Put angels on you niggas who be playin' like y'all demons
You dig?

[Verse 9: Lil Yachty]
Middle finger to them niggas hatin' and fakin'
They plottin' on my death, I give their mothers deep penetration
Diamond choker for some reason give me pure ventilation
Every real nigga livin' will respect this collaboration

[Verse 10: Tee Grizzley]
We the bust down brothers, check the Rollies out
Say you winnin' one more time, I'm pullin' trophies out
Niggas know we out, no Shaqs, all Kobes out
In other words, I'm with all shooters that'll blow you down
(Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop!)

[Verse 11: Lil Yachty & Tee Grizzley]
From the D to the A, put respect on it
If that's your ho, why my dick got her mouth on it?
I'm from the south, I got diamonds in my teeth
I got fur on my fleece, my new ring could pay your lease
(Lease, nigga)

[Verse 12: Tee Grizzley]
Chain on my dresser next to my indictment
When they said not guilty I was so excited
From the A to the D, bitch you heard Yachty
Wraith comin' this summer, I'ma have your bitch drivin'

Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup

But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb

I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome,"" you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
“Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!”
I said: “Don't embarrass me,” instead of “Be mine”
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over, what if you over my shit?

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

[Chorus: Hannah Williams]
I'm never gonna treat you like I should"

Them su, su, su, su, su
Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Shawn was on that gospel shit

Shit, stuff a million dollars in the sock drawer
That's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off
Y'all be talkin' crazy under them IG pictures
So when you get to hell you tell 'em Blanco sent ya
I can't take no threats, I got a set of twins (ah!)
Those were just some words you'll never hear again (uh huh!)
For the final time you don't believe these fools
I've never seen a worker rock so many jewels (never!)
I've never seen the runner with so many cars (never!)
Y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are
My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas
Just set the price so niggas'll live your life, my nigga
Once upon a time in the projects
Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex
I was in fight mode and now it's ""fuck me, mijo""
I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples
Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools
Who they effin' with, and we got FN's too
Before we had A&R's, we had AR's too
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid
Ty Ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6""
Got the heart of a giant, don't you ever forget
Don't you never forget, Jigga got this shit poppin'
I pulled out the pot when we was outta options

I pressed ahead of your team with one finger curled
I'll line you all up with one finger wave
Make niggas weave, niggas is out here fake
Laced front to the back, don't front
Y'all gonna make me wig, I'ma give y'all what you want, uh

Can’t nobody get up in my car today
Back seat feeling like a charter plane
Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It 2 Da Game
Paint dripping like I’m whipping marmalade (whoa)
Look at the way that I’m shining
I don’t be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie?
I said don’t worry I’m timeless
Watching Toy Story 3, that’s a great fucking movie
City of Jimi, Kurt, Quincy
City of me, Eddie, and Bruce Lee (whoa)
King of the road I drive slow like whoa
And I just switched over to Geico like whoa
Celebrating these life goals
But you ain’t getting no ride home

I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face

I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town

All eyes on me now
I be riding through Seatown
Taking pics when I eat out
Girls ask me to freestyle
Neighbors hate it when I speed out
I ain’t turning these beats down
GPS and I reroute
Chuck the deuce and I peace out
Sun roof tinted, don't need your opinions
I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I’d be right there with ya
But I’m committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don’t get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I’m sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I’ll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna that’s fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and I’m fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town

I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
When you hear that speaker sound, ound, ound
You know who it is, Lil Boat in your town
Whoa this beat so happy I will never frown
And my hair so nappy it’s gonna be a problem braiding it down
Oh no, oh no, we been grinding from the go
Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain’t the same we the new stars
Rock stars, look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it’s Macklemore and Lil Boat
Anything else you need to know

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town"

At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

[Verse]
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, ""How to make a milli'"" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, ""Bring the studio to everywhere we go"" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's 'cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you"

Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say

If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club throwing twenties like ""I'll be okay""
100k a day, trap booming like an 808

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy

If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 2]
Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
Then look at me now, bitch I'm drowning
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see 12
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got 3 mil', sitting in my email
So much on me, they second guessing what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had 30 on me
What the fuck I look like with less than 30 on me, nigga?

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

A thirty minute vid, I'm who you're obsessed with
You look like your sister is the girl that you have sex with
Uh, yeah, do you get the message?
On Twitter threaten rape, we should get this guy arrested
But I'm flexin'
Can you get these sheep out my mentions?
How can I be mad? Bitch, I sleep in a mansion
Try to hold me back but I keep on advancing
When I'm looking at his head, oou, that shit so gigantic
I’m coming still, bitch, my pocket’s filled with hunnid’ bills
I’m in the hills, bitch, my song just did a hunnid' mil'
They tellin’ me to stop flexing but I’m stuntin' still
I ran it up, all of the sudden bitches wanna chill
Ayy, you done crawled out your little cave
You got a girl but I can tell that you a little gay
Somebody stop the school shooter he look filled with rage
Speak on my name, little bitch, I'll put you in the grave
In the Wraith, I see stars like I'm K.O.'d
Bitches chase me, I don't got no time to chase hoes
For this song, I was gonna make y'all wait though
But like H3 I had to let the weight go
I remember I was broke, I couldn't dress a lot
Came up from nothing, little bitch, that's why I flex a lot
How much money did this cost you? Better guess, a lot
Is this nerd ever getting pussy? Shit, I'm guessing not
Yeah, he used to get picked on, he a big nerd
He don't got no points, he confuses you with big words
He said he study me for months like a mid-term
Ayy, Content Cop, can you get up off my dick sir?
Yeah, I'm yellow and I'm fly, call me Big Bird
They tryna see me start to fall like September
Try to roast me in the comments but remember
How you gon' support a guy who proudly says the N-word?

I ran it up fast, I feel like The Flash
You can see I'm getting mad, bringing up the past
H3 stop eating snacks, bitch you getting fat
Flew out PewDiePie just to fuck him in the ass

You can see I'm getting mad, bringing up the past

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Back up off me, back up off me

[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
Oh yah yah bitch, back up off me
You don't know me, I'm too clean, I'm too holy, bitch I'm godly
I only go for real niggas who don't brag 'bout what they bought me
Cause they know I got a bag, gotta fuck me up some commas
If I fuck and make you cum, you got to promise not to stress me
Don't be blowin' up my phone and don't be leavin' voice messages
Sayin' ""I can do you right, do you better than your exes""
I told that nigga to stop it, he was talkin' out his necklace
See the difference with me, I never needed niggas, ever
I'll leave 'em where I met 'em, I ain't trippin' off no extras
Goons in the cut try to talk you out your necklace
If you ever disrespect me, pussy, don't be disrespectful
I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
He heard about me, he was waitin' on me at the door
I said woo, yeah that mink all on the floor
Used to bust this shit at skatin', 6 to 9, come in at 4
We got glow sticks for you ho chicks, bitch don't act like you don't know this
I'm very antisocial, social network ain't my motion (I don't move like that)
I show no emotions, nigga's bitches it's disgustin'
Bananas with the Trojans, pop that pussy for a legend

Back up off me, they want my backs in coffins
It's so cold in the D and they still wanna take my jacket off me
Back when I couldn't afford to get it mixed and mastered, homie
My mama fronted me that money so it's no backup, homie
Bitch so back up off me
Bank account look like a ballot, homie, yeah it's checked up
My niggas packin', you get to trippin', they unpackin', homie
Yeah I overdo it, yeah that's salad, homie
Yeah I'm overdressed and ain't no salad on me
Me and DeJ together, holy matrimony
Yohhh, it's hard to smile and shit
When they ain't free Juan, I got real ones on trial and shit
Fuck all my peers unless we talkin' bout Belle Isle and shit
The check is seven figures, I might try and dial the shit
And if I fuck and make you cum, don't be blowin' up my phone
Lately I've been messin' with girls who tend to own shit on their own
I turn dusk into dawn, turn my chair to a throne
Fuck her off in the whip, make her take Uber home
Cold to the chromosome, I grew up without a hammock
I did everything except panic, feel me? Finally Famous the family
And we expandin' on the top floor like we tannin'
She throwin' tantrums
She gon' hold this dick like a Grammy
I give her bomb D and do damage, she like...

Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

Park it, might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist

Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just high yella you not that important
Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

I bought that bitch new Celine, I got rings, I got racks like Serena

He can't bag and pipe and leave that pussy killed like me
Or even keep the business behind his lips like me
I got a hundred fuckin' problems
Good brain, am I fuckin' with a scholar?
Woodgrain, I'ma grip it when I whip it
If I take a shot and brick it, I'ma flip it
Thankful for my papa, nigga taught me how to get it
Gotta make sure my brothers is eating, I'ma split it
If she throw that pussy at me I'ma hit it
Pen Griffey, but she won't get a penny, no
(Boy, if you don't get!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you ('cause I'm on witcha)
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers

[Chorus]
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me

[Outro]
Hey
Goddamn
Hey
We don't like gold diggers...
Goddamn I'm winnin', I'm winnin'
Goddamn I'm winnin'

Free trial memberships, though
I never join the shiz though (Ayy)
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin' finch though (Brr)
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite a bit
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans though (Ayy)
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands, though (Ayy)
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo (Ayy)
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke (Ayy)
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
My dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
If you at a restaurant and got a iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see he double charged ya
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem, sing along like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be (Brr)
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter tryna tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed"

And I'm shining bright ‘cause I'm really grindin'

My daughter gon' love this bitch here

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying

Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""

[Verse 1]
Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhené Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""

Diving be treacherous (Swim)
Pray to God that don't nobody mess with us (Him)
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo' bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats, they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""

Go to the dealership, fishtail off the lot
You know I'm comin' straight out the block
You know I'm comin' straight out the top
Shawty said she want 5 million
'Cause I told her to leave and called her a thot
Shit, you can like it or not, damn
I'm comin' straight out the pot
Still got some ACT in my stock
Nigga I ain't gotta lie
Nigga I ain't gotta try
You wavin' that thing in the sky?

We wavin' that thing at your eye!
Look at the watch on my wrist
Got 'em all watchin' my wrist
Told that lil bitch I'll pass
Nigga watch the assist
I run the trap like the marathon
You niggas softer than silicone
You know what it's like when the feelin' gone
I know what it's like when the ceilin' gone

Turn the White House to the Terror Dome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch!

Had to hit the Quan cause today is a good day

Nice shoes, car clean cause it’s sunny outside
That mean I pull up with my top down
I don’t have a top now
Mama told me never leave the house without my nightgown
Mama I’m on BET so I can act hyped now
On 'em like the WWE and lay the smackdown
That’s a lot to handle, how could he manage?
Mr. Hit the Quan went viral, gigantic
Hold up wait face it, go ahead pump your brakes fast
Always used to dodge cops, riding around with no plate tags
But they can never catch me, driving like a taxi
Waiting on my taxes, lights camera action
Finna play Michael Jackson, Oprah's in a jacket
Take it but I'll match it, y’all not in my bracket
It’s iHeart Memphis but I also love dabbing
I done took off on em, I feel like a pilot
I done took off on em, I don’t care bout the mileage
I’m so VIP all I know is private
I’ll take the steak, the strip, and the salad
Cause growing up in Memphis, Tennessee I couldn’t have it
Now come correct

Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say, oh no
Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle

Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Chorus]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Verse 1]
They came through with a stick and you heard it
They came through in this bitch and they were swerving
I can't believe the blood ain't on my shirt
Because he got hit close-range
We be talking stick talk, we be talking bricks too
We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too
I ain't got no manners for no sluts
I'ma put my thumb in her butt

[Verse 2]
I'ma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you're going broke
Oxycontin got her with a body count (sak pase)
Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him, ""ride me round the whole world""
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz

10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk

You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft

Fully loaded whip tote fully loaded clips
Fucking with my niggas, I'll smoke a zip
Red eyes, and I got them Zoes with me
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk

673,Wanna Be Happy?Kirk Franklin,"[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
The truth can hurt you
Or the truth can change you
What would truth do to you

[Verse 1]
I just wanna be happy
But if I keep on doing the things
That keep on bringing me pain
There's no one else I can blame
If I'm not happy
Wasted time but now I can see
The biggest enemy is me
So I'm not happy

[Pre-Chorus]
Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands
It won't change a thing child
Until you understand

[Chorus]
If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say ""Jesus take the wheel""
He knows the road that you need to take
(But it only works if)

[Post-Chorus]
If you wanna be happy
(Look at yourself and say)
Don't you wanna be happy
I just wanna be happy

[Verse 2]
But if I keep on giving my heart
For people to tear apart
The healing will never start
So I can be happy
Will I ever be happy

[Pre-Chorus]
Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands
It won't change a thing child
Until you understand (If I'm talking to you now say)

[Hook 2]
If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way (You been there too long)
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel
He knows the road that you need to take (I feel this one right here)
It's so easy to complain
Addicted to the pain
You give you heart, they push it away (But I got good news for ya)
Jesus knows just how you feel
Just let Him take the wheel
The love you need, he already gave (But the question is)

[Post-Chorus]
Do you wanna be happy (If you're tired of you then say)
I just wanna be happy (Now if you really mean that, open up your heart and say it)

Let me hear you say yeah

Let me hear you say yeah
(Say yeah)
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way (Are you ready, come on)
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say Jesus take the wheel (What you doin')
He knows the road that you need to take (It's so easy to complain)
It's so easy to complain (Come on)
Addicted to the pain
You give you heart, they push it away (There's somebody that'll never leave ya)
Jesus knows just how you feel
Just let him take the wheel
The love you need, he already gave (But the question is)

[Post-Chorus]
Do you wanna be happy (Took a long time but I'm ready)
I just wanna be happy (Thank you Lord, every day ask yourself)
Do you wanna be happy (Yes, pull over, let him drive)

Thank God I would have never found this, I doubt it
I'm there for you if you allow it

All this paper we counting, blazing these ounces
Spending on you baby no matter what the amount is
Now you wanna know what's gotten into me, what's changed?
I guess I had a hard time showing it at first but

I try not to think about you
What can I say, everytime I get near you
I want that old thing back, now bring it to me
Shorty keep telling me what to do about you
Then she got jealous soon as she knew about you
She don't never wanna see her go through round two
(Cut her off!) Cut her off that's what I'm doing now, you
Told me I should go out and do my thing
(Damn right!) Damn right I do my thing
Now you want to know what's gotten into me, what's changed?
But baby none change

[Hook]
Baby it's been that way
Baby it's been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
Baby it's always, always, always been that way
It's always been that way
(Didn't I tell you girl?)
It's always been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
It's always been that way
It's always been that way

I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets
Roll around like I run this shit

I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me?
Get me healthy
Keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin'
Like, fuck it, we ballin'

Too much on my plate

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browser
Like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

[Hook: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

[Outro: Miguel]
Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m in, gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit with you, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always
The start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it
But, baby, it’s gon be alright, ha, alright"

Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone

Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke (Liquor, smoke)
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough (Dick and dough)
Told her, ""You don't gotta make it difficult""
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes Christian
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired
Why the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong

It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no lying
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no flying

[Verse 1]
You dropping them dimes, you dropping them dimes, you dropping them dimes
You look like you lying, you look like you lying, you look like you lying
We do this Sunday to Sunday
Sun up to the sun down
Look like I stepped on the runway
They try to tell me to calm down
Peep how I came in the game and I start rocking that Tom Ford
We don't what we be saying, we just be yelling out Bonjour
We don't what we be saying, we just be yelling out Bonjour
I like to play with them bands right before I do the encore
I like to play with the cash, go to Laurent and spaz
I like to play with the cash, go to Chanel and spaz
I like to go to the jeweler, tell 'em to make me some glass
I like to play with the cash, go to Chanel and spaz

[Chorus]
Kicking flavors Saint Laurent watch how I walk
Let this paper be the reason why we talk
Ain't no favors, they gon' outline you in chalk
You the biggest, biggest hater of them all

[Verse 2]
You slangin' that iron, you slangin' that iron, you toting that iron
You pressin' the issue, you pushing the gas, you making 'em violate
I'm dropping the top on that foreign, I zig and I zag I'm all on the grass
I did what I had to pass, you niggas you better go back to your stash
I did what I had to do, I ran in that bitch I didn't have a mask
I did what I should have did, survive through the trenches and look like a man
I sit at the throne, I sit at the throne, you niggas ain't nothing but some clones
I sipping that Dom Perignon, when I'm at the store they ringing me up
My bitch on her bitch, got her eatin' it up
I done gained a little weight and I'm keeping it up
Step in them Christians I done came out the mud
I'm flexing on purpose when I'm in the club

[Chorus]
Kicking flavors Saint Laurent watch how I walk
Let this paper be the reason why we talk
Ain't no favors, they gon' outline you in chalk
You the biggest, biggest hater of them all
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no time
It ain't no time, it ain't no his, it ain't no mine
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no lying

Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work

Used to be sleeping on itchy beds
Bed bugs in the motel, now your bitch give me head
Twenty bitches in the hotel on a ramen noodle diet
Tour life wasn't so well
All my niggas starting riots, moshpitting on your toenails
Uncle T doing so well, first class from a old jail
T Ferg did fifteen in the feds, getting no mail
My daddy died and my cousin too
They didn't let them out of no cell
Provide jobs for my whole block, I cannot slow down
Nigga, I won't stop now, mothafucka this is my town
Take the block, make it hot now, 143rd with the drop down
Icy chain with the watch now, third piece full of rocks now
Niggas squint when they watch now, leveling up to the top now

Bought me some better bezels
Man and went to see my jeweler, woo and I re'd up
Went and bought some new jewels
Hit the car dealer, woo-woo re'd up
Who knew we would blow up like nitro, now these bitches need us
Woo I just tasted molly on me, Lord knows I just re'd up
Dib and dab in this some new designer
I just dib and dab with the semi tucked
You on the red carpet surrounded by pop stars trying to act tough
I gotta Actavis on me, nigga, and I po'd up
They say that we couldn't smoke in this bitch
And we fucked around and still rolled up

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level

Daddy looking down, I know he see me blowin’ up
My grandma would be so proud
Up in Heaven, Yamborgini, know my brother see me
I'ma make my bro proud
Tell his mama I'ma take her outta work
Know that I'ma hold my bros down
A$AP till a nigga die
If you didn’t know well you know now
I gotta get in my zone now
I gotta get in my zone now
Only a couple-a more down
Momma gon' get a new home now
Teach Marty Baller how to be a boss
So none of us ever go broke now
I'ma bring you to the water swim nigga
I cannot bring you the boat now

Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work

[Outro: Future]
My wardrobe is Tiffany Stones
I'm really putting on
Talking back to a King bitch, does not get condone

That means I just caught me a new check

715,Ill Mind Of Hopsin 8Hopsin,"[Verse 1]
Nigga, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
Homie, I made you rich, paid your rent (Damn right!)
Bitin' the hand that was feedin' you
This shit don't make any sense
Nigga, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
You know this is that real shit
How you gon' forget who built this? (Huh?)
I'm the one who made the company all the millions
Now you got problems to deal with
Man, this is tough luck, see a couple weeks ago we was buds
And the crew that was killin' shit was us
'Til you turned on me, homie, that's fucked up
I ain't keepin' this shit on the hush, hush
On my chest I just carry too much stuff
I done had it, enough is enough, bruh
Plus I needed somethin' to get my buzz up
You done fucked with the wrong dude
Ain't no tellin' what Hopsin is gon' do, creepin' up on you
Quit your sleepin', I told you
This a mothafuckin' journey we finna go through
If I ain't have so much to lose
I swear to God I'd probably beat up and choke you (Damn!)
Nigga, this is that raw shit (Right?)
That organic flow you probably see up in Whole Foods
Shiver me timbers, somethin's fishy 'bout you, Mr. D Ritter
When I told you that I wanted new management
Why the fuck you throw a fit and seem bitter?
Why you catch an attitude whenever I question you
About all my fuckin' percentages?
I know why (Why?), you've been bendin' it
In your benefit—your honor, I'm innocent!
This nigga crazy, I'm tellin' all of my people (You tell 'em!)
He takin' all of my C-Notes (It's true)
See, he has a gamblin' issue
He takes the cash and blows it all at casinos (Damn!)
Uh-oh, when I bring up my royalties
You start avoidin' me, that's some disloyalty
You woke up the evil boy in me, your ass is poisonin
Tell me why you would destroy FV?
This was a fuckin' vision that I had created with your brother
But you too infatuated with the money
You killed it and ran it straight into the gutter
Now I think, ""Why'd I make D—A—M—E the boss?""
You keep pissin' a whole lot of people off
Our whole label came out with a weak result
You on that same bullshit Tomica brought

[Chorus]
Nigga, I don't know what you thought
You think I can't see the blood on the walls?
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
I don't know what you thought
I can clearly see the blood on the wall
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit

[Interlude]
Hold up! Hold up!
I got some more shit to say, yo

[Verse 2]
It's supposed to be Funk Volume, isn't it?
Thought it was music above all the business
But you just said: ""Fuck all you niggas!""
You tarnished the brand
And you started a Funk Volume Fitness?
Come on now, really think
Got us portrayin' somethin' we really ain't
How we supposed to be ill
When you on our website with a Shake weight
Tryna be Billy Blanks—nigga, thanks!
Fool, ain't nobody tryna lift weights
We just wanna hit up the studio and just rap and do shows
But you don't understand the culture of hip-hop
You a lame-ass nigga, Dame, half the crew knows
New-Age Jerry Heller, a scary fella
I hate your fuckin' name, every letter
I'm very fed up, you actin' like an ordinary heffa
I'ma take you to the mortuary dress-up
We gave you our trust, then you had us cornered
You got us a shitty label deal with Warner
And if I confront you about it
You tell me I need counsellin' and I got a disorder
You sent me on tour and it's horror
Shitty hotels, no sleep, with no food to order
Meet and greets every single day, it's torture
How you expectin' an A1 performer?
Every time somethin's wrong it's the same thing (What?)
Blah-blah-blah-blah, you just blame me (Damn!)
Then you tell Brooklyn and Jammie (Damn!)
Now they both thinkin' I'm crazy (Damn!)
I deal with this on the daily (Damn!)
My career mentally rapes me (Damn!)
I won't let this nigga break me
He prayin' Dizzy Wright is gon' replace me, shady

[Verse 3]
What are your fuckin' motives, Dame? Let's talk about it!
Umm, you're our manager, our label-owner, our accountant
Hmm, that's kinda tricky
Somethin is fishy, that's risky
We just don't even know
We go with the flow while you rowin' the boat
You keepin' it simple-minded
'Cause you knowin' our only concern is just hopin' we blow
So, when all the money come in from our album and tours
You sit there and soak in the dough
When did we ever ask about the gross?
When did we ever ask about the net?
You would just hand us money from our shows
'Cause you knew we wasn't questionin' the checks
Nigga, I trusted you with my life
You upped your percentage so I'm makin' less?!
Fuck you, bitch, you get no respect!
This is why Hop is comin' for your neck (Bless!)
All you care about is makin' money
You don't care about a fuckin' soul though
You just fluctuate our dollars up and down
At your convenience like a fuckin' pogo
You been screwin' everybody on the label on the low
And they don't even know though
So, good luck, Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz, I'm goin' solo

[Chorus]
Nigga, I don't know what you thought
You think I can't see the blood on the walls?
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
I don't know what you thought
I can clearly see the blood on the wall
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit

[Spoken Outro: Joel Osteen]
Change is one of the most difficult things that we face. But change is inevitable
One reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do
Just because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change
Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever
If you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends"

Love yours
Love yours
No such thing

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Refrain]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing

Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold

This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

How can you just leave me standing

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did

I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
Get 'em!

Usually hear the phone late night like now
She usually say no, but she almost always breaks right down
She finna drive an hour to my house, right now
Can't wait to break the walls and knock all your lights out
She said that she should probably be alone right now
How long has it been?
Why are you even all up on my phone right now?
You leave my body weak
Then you disappear for weeks
And I'm way too strong right now
Where you been?
Why do you go missing?
Where you be when I need your attention?
I know that you need that (need some)
Tell me you don't miss it you don't want it right now
Cause all I need to hear, you can lay it back down
Tell me you don't think about it, that's a damn lie
Don't nobody make it feel, make it feel like when I'm inside
You don't got to gas me girl, I'm full up
Imma let you get some sleep, get some give up
She said you really want this pussy, you would pull out

Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once

Neighbors know my name
Got you screaming Mike Angel

You been putting time aside for me
You say I never got the time for you

I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light

[Verse 1: Swae Lee & (Slim Jxmmi)]
Pick a price for me, please
We can spend whatever
Camera lights bounce off my shiny bezel
Kill the lights, would you? I am on my level
Flexin' like I've been up in the gym forever
All these bitches give me brain, damn they sure is clever
I took a bitch out, let her shop 'til she drop
All these big bags come at once like nonstop
Ridin' droptop so I can't even hotbox
We can spend whatever
Young Swae Lee, damn, check out my bezel
I blow lots of cash cause I won't live forever (do it)

No she not a keeper, she just my little freak
Hotbox the coupe and we fuckin' in it
I do what I do, and the bitches dig it
Straight out the blue, I got your attention (she love it, man)
Was it the coupe or the watch glistenin'?
I'm winnin', mane, I'm winnin', chain yellow like the Simpsons

I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, ""Don't text me, ho""
Told you four times, ""Don't test me, ho""
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh Indian
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

In front of Neiman's in a black Jag
Told her if the head fire, swear I’ll buy her a new ass

Seems like they're just happier than us these days

These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

[Verse 1: Drake]
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right

I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life

But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
We done really put some days in

[Interlude: Future]
Hey, why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?

Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me

They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me

They gon' think I won a Grammy

Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there

This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?

Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am...."

I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do

753,U With Me?Drake,"[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit"

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you

Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you

Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?

You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited

You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy

Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah

757,Weston Road FlowsDrake,"[Intro]
One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

Yeah, that's right, yeah"
758,Keep The Family CloseDrake,"[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro: Girl (Spoken)]
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

I got problems bigger than these boys, yeah
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone

When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know, I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

[Chorus: Jamila Woods & Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone (Don't be mad)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone

The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down

They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex-girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four-minute songs
You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh
(Good God)

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, (Good God) the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]

Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no

No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah"

If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh-igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam

I might give Satan a swirlie

Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothin' away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothin' away

Put a milli' in his bank account
Don't leave him out I was thinkin'
I'll never do him wrong like they did the operation
Took a nigga's vision from him, was a mothafuckin' baby
Said a couple years later they can give it back to me
Technology is movin' too slow, I'm waitin' patiently
Shit, I don't want it no more, this how I'm meant to be
Remember young kids in the school used to laugh at him
Guess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics
Niggas broke and Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?
Man I bought about 12 cars just to blast past 'em
Switch cars so much, they don't know which one to blast at
And my bitch so bad and you know her ass fat
Wanna ride through and they is who I'll laugh at

We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work, your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place, but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shorties with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

[Chorus: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'
Said we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history, baby (Juke), maybe (Juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be, maybe (Juke), I'm crazy (Juke)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
We never rolled at the Rink, we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down,"" Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist to your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor, all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do what grown folks do when they grown and they dating

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history, baby (That's right, that's right), maybe (That's right, that's right)
Maybe you and I were meant to be, maybe I'm crazy
Crazy 'bout you

[Chorus: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'
Said we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam

Am I the only one who really care about cover art?
Growing up I ain't have my brother
'Cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again, they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After ""1 Night"" the fuck thought I was finished?
I pinned my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch, I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
Bitch, it's Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit

Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes

Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'

Skrrt, skrrt, all about the mula ('Bout the mula)
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off (Bling)
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God (Pray to God)
Soon as the floor hit my feet, I'm getting high (Gettin' high)

Nah, bitch, I'm 1K, and I'ma keep it one hundo
Bitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off

Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire

Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

784,DriftingG-Eazy,"[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Got this flight to London, I ain't pop no Xans for it
In case you was wonderin', I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A., barely caught the plane
Fuckin' TSA, swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you-all-know-my-name-shit
Me, I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn, she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now I'm missing your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, ooh, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you (ooh)
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart (woah)
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
(Now, I mean, yeah)
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, ""Who is this?""
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, yeah, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think, think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off, yeah
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
(You tell me, uh, yeah)
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am, ooh
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh, yeah
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you, ha (ooh)
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
And now I'm missing your love, ooh"

You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I’m not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up

Oh yeah, I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your forté
You used to be

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player

We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you

[Verse 2: The Game]
'Member when you used to curved me, leave my text message unread?
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and

[Chorus: Jeremih]
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Lookin' at me like you love me
We can do it now or later
She wan' lick on party favorite
On my wave, tryna surf it up
Know we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up
Certified with the double-M pullin' up
Tooly got a room, we'll play ""Room Up In Here"", been here
Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up
But you know when we get together

[Collision: The Game]
You want me to say your name, huh?
Karrueche!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck

All eyes on me

Bounce back game good, why we talkin' practice?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, pull up score when I want to
Best thing next to Heaven

A real woman 'bout her paper
Niggas don't know where I came from
Boy I really really came up
You never could say I'm lacking
All this shit I've been through
And it made me more of an assassin
I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I kill 'em with compassion

Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em,  tell 'em

Lit, lit, lit, lit, only L I take is to the face
You showed up to see me lose
But I overcome so you overcame
Basic, basic, ain't nothin' bout me basic
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, better watch what you say to me
'Cause Young Sway got the answers
Give 'em hell, give 'em pressure
VIP couch, no manners, dirty-dirty-dirty dancin'
Take a look at what I did, go for circle with the wrist
Whippin'-whippin' up the grits, get a handful of this nasty
I got it, I got it, I got it and you gon' respect it
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin'
Gon' stop me from makin' it happen
So baby, if they askin'

Do you think I’ll ever need you, love, more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round still think I'm timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

[Verse 1]
Pretty teeth with a nice demeanor
I'm in a rush, it was nice to meet ya
Collared shirt, no elongated T's, cheaper to be yourself
Ain't no wrong way to be, accomplished a lot
Came from the block, ambitious in the trenches
I got a long way to reach
Sorry if I was offensive, but not at all
You got to pardon me at times, okay problem solved
When I hear the word can't take it like a challenge
I don't understand why the hell I can't have it
Help me understand why the hell I can't have it
I was blessed with a swag and I ain't braggin'
Insecurities get covered with designer fashion
If I'm not intimidatin' tell me why you're bashful
If you not feelin' what I'm sayin', sorry for the hassle
But if you leavin' here with me it'll be fantastic

Do you think I'll ever need you love more than you need me?

How long could I see her round think I'm still timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

[Verse 2]
Ain't no relaxin', they pillow fightin' on the sofa
Not at all my main focus though I was hopin'
Pull your hair, kiss it soft while you bendin' over
After that we could shower and I could hold ya
Havin' deep conversation and now you open
Pretendin' that I was asleep while you on the phone
Listen to you tell your girlfriend how I stroke it
Only that it was a foot I already know it, mind blowin'
Phone rang bout to go, is you rollin'
Playin' poker no cards, throwin' hands exposin'
Rest in peace Soulja Slim, slow motion
Kicked out of everywhere, expulsion

Do you think I'll ever need your love more than you need me?

801,Cranes In The SkySolange,"[Verse 1: Common]
She seen pain in my eye
Men and women at work, cranes in the sky
We gon' keep building for our children's children
Doctors keep pilling, love is a drug then drugs can't heal 'em
But listen to Lauryn for the healing, peeling back layers
Pops used to hoop, I'm from a bloodline of players
Love and sunshine like Roy Ayers
Put your mind on the phone, I ain't coming back home
I felt the death of what it is to be alone
Everlasting love, money can't buy
Can't hide from the truth even when I pop the lock
Can't work it away, can't drink it away
Can't laugh it away, can't think it away
That pain come up on you like a thief in the day
Searching for the sun, I found my Issa Rae
Insecurity cold, imperial robes
I used to wear my heart open like Ethereal Rose
Now I'm carrying loads of baggage I don't claim
If she start tripping I'm hopping on the plane
Cranes in the sky, I know how the metal sound
I never settled in life so it's hard to settle down
Staying on my square trying not to get around
Hold my lady hostile, she could rebel down
Don't touch my hair, I'm baldheaded
Kept my love locked down like it was all dreaded
Wishing for wings again so I could spread it
But now it's in a plastic cup of false beverage

[Verse 2: Solange]
I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair

[Verse 3: Solange]
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress would make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder

[Verse 4: Solange]
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away

[Refrain 1: Solange]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

[Hook 1: Solange]
Well it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

[Verse 5: Solange]
I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving round make me feel better

[Verse 6: Solange]
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away
Don't you cry baby
Away

[Refrain 1: Solange]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

[Hook 2: Solange]
But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal...

I lost it all, my friends, my loved ones
But in life there's always a chance to grow
From the struggle, from the pain, from the realness
Here's my story, Lloyd

[Verse 1]
Hey world, yeah I know it's been a while
Thought I'd come around to let you know what's up now
No album lately so my mind is kinda up-down
I still been taking care my mama and them somehow
Disappeared from the scene and left my old team
Had to find a new approach to an old dream
And it's not to take a shot at my old team
I just want you to see

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true

[Verse 2]
Apologies if I ever let you down
But so much shit done happen that it's hard to talk about
So many lawsuits that my lawyer said don't talk about it
Just had to breathe, keep it cool 'til I can walk up out it
Came home helped my sister raise a child
Kinda hurt me cause I could've had my own now
Lost my baby damn it's really hitting home now
I just had to learn

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true

[Bridge]
I look up to the sky, Lord why do I cry
When no one is looking, is the blame for this pain
Even caused by the shame of this fame I've been given
My pride don't cause me to hide my true feelings
Cause I can only be real
Cause I can only be real

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true
Alright, alright
And all I wanna be is true
Alright
And all I wanna be is true
And all I wanna be is true
Alright
And all I wanna be is true"

I got a big amount, I took a different route
I am the pick of the litter
I was in juvy, they gave me community
I had to pick up some litter
I want it easy, please do not tease me
I wore my Yeezys to dinner
This is the season, I got the seasonin'
Don't make me sprinkle you niggas
I got my reasons, you wanna please me
Send me the pussy, not pictures
Met her this week and fucked her this evenin'
She turn a freak on the liquor

Yeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches
Yeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches
Yeah, rock double-cross on these bitches, yeah

Ten on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin' paid
Gettin' laid

Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House
Patty melt with the hash browns
Tryna avoid all the pat-downs
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes
Weirdos in the background
Blackout when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, ""Pick a fur""
Last night was a blur to me
This mornin' I got two with me
I don't know what to do with me
Goin' ape like the zoo with me
Got a tool with the screw missin'
Two girls in the pool kissin'
Everywhere I go, the rod with me

Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, ""You bad and you know it""
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code

You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block

Love ain't just black and white

If I make it through hell and I come out alive I got nothing to fear
No more crying and trying
And bring back this loving when nothing is here
Let me be clear
I wasn’t perfect
But this shit ain't worth it
I’m done with the mess
I confess on the stress
And I know Ima look back and call it a blessing

Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint, ayy

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky (Ayy)

Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

Say dawg
I remember way back
I’m talkin’ way way way back
Petey had the grey black
Two tone wave cap
You say we rap niggas be like
Oh, so you supposed to be a rapper
Fuck outta here man

[Prehook]
Just gotta say it
Can’t hold it in
Woke up at 10
I’ve smokin’ since 10
You might say that its trife
Shit it is what it is
When you living your life
And the stress is a bitch
So I do what do

[Hook]
Don’t judge me
Don’t judge me
Cause mary jane is the
Only girl that love me
So fuck the hoes and
These cops tryna cuff me

[Verse 1]
Now first off to the holice
Let me say mutha fuck you
You 'pose to serve and protect
But we need to get protection from you
Every nigga ain't a criminal
Nah nah nah nah
Every time I drive by one
They follow follow
Like I said mutha fuck you
To these rappers putting me to the test
I would have crushed you like a bug
But didn’t have time to clean up the mess
Too many bones and body parts
That I would need to collect
But shit every living soul
Owes the reaper a debt
And let me switch topics again
Cause I’m deep in regret
I was cursed labeled a dog and
Forced to sleep on the steps
Them fly wifey types
We never seem to respect
You stay screamin' I never cared
But I grieved when you left

[Prehook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now next thing is these chatty patties
Gossiping mutha fuck you
Heard they claim they real niggas
But that ain't how real niggas move
Are they beefing are they talking
Who’s these girls and who’d he fuck
Nosey asses know my coke head
Be like van goh with the brush
I can get it all and have it all
It still won’t be enough bitch
Petey Petey moving on the fast track
Petey thinkin' abstract
Petey get the first
And get the last laugh
Petey blowing smoke out
On the snapchat pack stat
Petey p just wanna know
Who’s crib We meeting back at
It's my time nigga my moment
Imma own it
I turn up every Tuesday
I love Makonnen
I’m dusty, smoking
Girl bust it open
My luggage ? ?
Forgot my lotion
Still coasting
In Costa Rica
In coach seating
When they see it's us roaming
We like some roman caesars
Prestigious Petey Petey
Bison Beckford
Coulda modeled if I was taller
But i like my leverage
I gave you demons and
Paint on my Vices effort
And now all I hear is jeers
Like Obie Trice's record
I’ll still cop it if
They overprice the necklace
These rappers ain’t nice and
Y’all overhyping their efforts

3-1-0 9-3-4 8-6-1-6
I got a missed call from your bitch
She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like girls in the shower, when it's winter fresh
It’s some Twitter pussy, I met on the Internet
On my late-night thirsty, ‘cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'
I keep a stack of hundreds, I can keep a secret
If anything you was explorin', you wasn’t cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih (YG)]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl, I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuckin' like no other
(I keep it on the D.L, and creep like TL
Just tell me them details, just hand me)
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em (no)

[Outro: Jeremih]
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, no
Why, why, why, why would you do (oh)
Just keep the rhythm like that, that (that, that)
Put in on like that, that (that, that)
I know you like that (that, that, that, that)
You know I want that (that, that, that, that)
Ohh oh-ohh oh-ohh oh-ohh"
818,Black WidowIggy Azalea,"[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby
(Black, black widow, baby)

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya

826,Bed Of LiesNicki Minaj,"[Intro: Skylar Grey]
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

[Pre-Chorus]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't ""How To Be A Player,"" you ain't Bill Bellamy

[Pre-Chorus]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies"

Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine fo'
Never heard about you, all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me, nigga, trill-ass individual
Go and check on that nigga, sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental, got a L full of that killer

Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains, so they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, ""Why you got so many condoms with you?""
I say, ""I'm a player, to be honest with you""
Hublot, woo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, wit' the loud, singing acapella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless them

829,SoldierDamien,"[Verse 1]
What have I done to feel these fists from heaven?
I have to question
Have I done wrong?
What's with this reaction?
Am I a mad man?
If I walked on water would I sink or drown?
I think I'm lost, could I ever be found?
If I held your Bible will my soul set fire?
When that dark day comes will I be up by your side?

[Chorus]
Oh, when this world comes crashing down
I'll be, I'll be the soldier, I'll be the soldier
Oh, when this place falls to the ground
I'll be, I'll be the soldier, I'll be the soldier

I guess it's you, hey, I guess it's you
That makes me be the bad one
That makes me be the mad one
I guess it's you, hey, I guess it's you
That puts these thoughts inside me
It's like you wanna hide me
Ooh yeah, I guess it's you

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, ""Thanks for the view"", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like ""boing!"" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I"

Don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love

[Bridge]
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
Until the morning we can freak, but baby girl, you gotta know
We can rumble in these sheets but after this you gotta go
Don't take it personal, when it feel so good, we tend to get emotional
But that is when you find out that it hurts the most, since then I've always been like, trust nobody show no love

[Hook]
Pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You used to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love
Don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love

Flip money fast like Sonic, rich nigga I speak ebonics
Got a new car I paid cash, got a new crib with a weed lab
Crisp bills I need that, fuck your team where the freaks at
Hundred deep in V.I.P., niggas always hatin'
I came in with a bunch of goons and I'm leavin' with out with his lady

844,I LiedNicki Minaj,"[Intro]
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

[Verse 1]
Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said ""let’s see""
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose?
You just a heart breaker, won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines

[Hook]
I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

[Verse 2]
Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities, and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

[Bridge]
I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d do, if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you

[Outro]
So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you?
It’s all good now
Goodbye now
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart forever"
845,All Things GoNicki Minaj,"[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go"

848,The Crying GameNicki Minaj,"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

[Bridge 1: Nicki Minaj]
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, the crying game

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)

[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone, 'cause the tears don't end

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, the crying game

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

""¿Sí, me amas? Yo te quiero mucho
Todo el tiempo que pasamos, lo que te quería decir es que… tu estás jodiéndome la vida. *Laughs*

All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet, he F with me
That G shall surely see, he definitely as 'bout it
As retail fraud, he's weak, the honest gesture
The trigger finger round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography Range Rover
This ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' make-up, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles'll air his coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot, like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life; call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent-free (Real talk!)

Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me (Me)
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me (Me)
I'm over-respected
My mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway
Now my closet fifty shades of grey
26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church, tryna get a little savings, yeah, a coupon (God)
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number, like, ""You still ain't got a new line?""
(You still ain't got a new line?)
Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach, with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place
Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel (Let's go,) lil' bitch!

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
‘Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder, then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo' ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So, nigga, I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Have K's in front of your school, but I ain't goin' to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross-eyed like Bernstein’s son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against
The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick!
I still never ABC this shit
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets
I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from
On a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's ragin' and heated and
On the way to go beat his kid?
On a track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if
I wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't
Wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
Hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryna reinsulate your windows
May be in for another crazy winter
‘Cause so cold in the D, it is
As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
What made me into the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler
And mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and
Attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us…

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey, Em, let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'!
Detroit! Okay!

871,Good LovinLudacris,"[Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me"

I hope she don't come over here 'cause I'm with my girl, you know I love her
I got two of my bitches in the club and they know about each other, oh, no

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Uh, but a nigga never Paranoid
You fuckin' with a man, not a little boy
What? I could barely hear your lil' voice

And grab her hand, tell her we should go now
If you really wanna take this party to the hotel

Take it to the hotel, baby, leave with me
Know I got a penthouse suite
I said why you over there lookin' at me
While I'm with my girlfriend?

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
Over there lookin' all suspicious
Get a clue, girl, don't be a mystery
I see you likin' on all my pictures
Of me and my bitch up in all of our business (woah)
So, you gotta know it ain't a limit to
What a pill and the liquor do (nah)
Make a straight girl go down, just spit down
I might fuck around and lick her too
It ain't a problem, my metabolism high
Eat you both up for dinner (woah)
Just keep it real with a real motherfucker
Ain't got time for no pretenders
Now just bring it to me
That fleek, that freak, no classy stuff (uh)
Been pushin' up, don't pussy out (uh)
Bitch, what you really on? (Nah, what?)

I said, said why you over there lookin' at me (whoop)
While I'm with my girlfriend?
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah, we could take it there (woah)
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah baby, we could take it there (woah)

ATM go nuts, I do what I want
I say what I want, I grew up on Pac
Kush smell just like must, turn it into dust
Man, my style is tough, y'all huffed all that puss
Twerk like she from Russia, try hard not to love her
But she so damn bad, I-I-I might have to cuff her
Rock like Billy Ray, that's a nigga idol

Lil' bit of money make a difference
Nothin' to somethin', it's so hard to function with all of these hoes in the house
Fuck y'all assumption, my blood still rushin', my heart still thumpin'
Up like Trump, geekin' like Ike
Got a bitch twerkin' on Skype
MGM every night, Sremm after dark, king of the swipe
Motherfuckers worried 'bout likes on they pictures
They ain't got a ""Iguodala,"" or a nickel
They ain't even got a penny for the strippers
And they wanna pop bottles like winners
Check my pedigree, I always been a money fiend
All these fuckin' rings, I'm shinin' like a fuckin' king
Breakin' down the kush, don't it look so plush?
Take a couple puffs, up like Donald Trump (Woo)

[Hook: Drake & Future]
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
Life is great when you’re naked, you press the gas and I break it
I drink liquor don’t chase it and I get women don’t chase ‘em
I’ll put her face in the pillow and watch her bite on the blanket
See you tempted to taste it, get every drop and don’t waste it
I’m fucking with you, I’m fucking with you
The type of dick to make that white girl say ‘’I love that nigga’’
I’ll hit your Instagram and click like on like every picture
You get it from your momma? Well then bring ya momma with ya
And lots of liquor
Tell her ""fuck me like you hate me,"" ""You love me?"" I said maybe
She said ""boy don't keep me waiting""
And I say ""go down, don't be lazy""
Yeah, now that's my baby, that's my baby
She love me for my drive, I love her cause she drive me crazy
What's up?

Don’t fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly
I don’t have to lie
Lot of people say it in a song just to say it
Man, I’m not that type of guy, hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city
Send you home with stories you can never tell
I’m tryna break you out of your shell (And what?)
You just turned 21 like Adele, that’s good with me
I put my business on hold
Let me turn off the phone, let’s explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me, you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure, I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that you’d rather smoke, well, let me call up OB’s room
And tell ‘em roll up a cone
I know he probably got that extra special (yup)
I never second guess it
How's Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?
Man, she like, ""Fuck the small talk
I’m not here to discuss extra credits or my professors""
No time for funny stories
It’s funny how she shows up late, but always comes before me
We both young and misguided, but that’s another story, yeah

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package

This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I

Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed"

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that should go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Chorus]
I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that should go
You know how that should go

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes

I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'

These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything

They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service

Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though, voicemail say she ready though (Yeah)
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'Cedes Benz pedal
Doin' ninety on the bridge like, ""Nigga you already know""
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin up the angles, now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four, five chains, man the gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, ""The first mill' gon' change you""
Change for the better, hit it, then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together

Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass

Now I'm in the East 'cause them boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out, the shit would disappear

On some ""why-you-love-these-strippers?"" shit

Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it

Yeah

[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

[Outro]
Yeah, gotta love it

I feel the blood rushin' throughout ya body
You see the scars painted over my skin
I'm always numb to the topic of lovin'
I fell in love with the subject of sin

[Refrain]
I don't have to remind you, it's my need to confine you
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? (Put your feelings behind you)
I don't have to remind you (don't have to remind you)

897,You & The 6Drake,"[Intro]
Rider shit

[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who""
I told her, ""girl, I'm always back with you know who,"" yeah
And she like, ""Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice

[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price

[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life"

Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

901,See You AgainWiz Khalifa,"[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side

Sometimes you feel insecure

Sexy comes in every size keep wearing that

You'll never go out of style
Cause you ain't got time to pack
You look too good to be mad

Them jeans
You should be happy with a nappy
Hot damn have you seen them thighs

906,InstitutionalizedKendrick Lamar,"[Part I]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Interlude: Anna Wise & Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

[Part II]

[Intro: Taz Arnold]
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Life to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me

[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...

[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service"
907,ConquerorEmpire Cast,"[Verse 1: Jussie Smollett]
Life is like a big merry go round
You're up and then down
Goin' in circles, tryin' to get to where you are
Everybody's been counting you out
But where are they now?
Sittin' in the same ole' place, just faces in the crowd

[Bridge: Jussie Smollett]
Well, we all make mistakes
You might fall on your face
But you gotta get up

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett & Estelle]
I'd rather stand tall
Than live on my knees
Cause I am a conqueror
And I won't accept defeat
Try tellin' me no
One thing about me
Is I am a conqueror
I am a conqueror
Oh

[Verse 2: Estelle]
Got a vision that no one else sees
Lot of dirty work, roll up your sleeves
Remember there's a war out there, so come prepared to fight
You never know where the road will lead you
Not everyone's gonna believe ya'
And even though they're wrong, don't prove 'em right

[Chorus: Estelle & (Jussie Smollett)]
I'd rather stand tall (tall)
Than live on my knees (can't live on my knees)

I'd rather stand tall (whoo, ooo, ooo)
Than live on my knees (than live on my knees)
Cause I am a conqueror (I am a conqueror)
And I won't accept defeat (and I won't accept defeat)

910,How Much A Dollar CostKendrick Lamar,"[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more""
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need""
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God""

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs

912,Good EnoughEmpire Cast,"[Verse 1]
I gave you all of me
But it still ain't enough to make you happy
I gave you everything
It still don't measure up
It feels like I walked 5 thousand miles
And didn't even come close
Feels like I try to make you smile
But you don't even care, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But i keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I got to do?

[Chorus]
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that i can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough

[Verse 2]
I try to show you that I'm strong
Why do I even bother?
Cause it's the same old damn song
And you call yourself a father
Feels like I'm reaching for the stars
But heaven isn't letting me
I wish that I had longer arms
But I know that will never be never be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But i keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I got to do?

[Chorus]
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that i can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough

[Bridge]
Look at me
I'm standing right here waiting for you, here I am
Look at me
Lookin' for your acceptance, do you give a damn?
Look at me
See it doesn't matter what you think, I'm still a man
Look at me
Open up your eyes, can't you see that I'm good enough

[Chorus]
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that i can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough"

Right, I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
Cuz most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
Cuz (ooh) you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Hook: Jennifer Hudson]
Don’t you come here thinkin' you ballin' (oh nah)
Ain't down for it

And you turn up so fresh and clean
Smells like trouble to me

Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy what a perfect match
And if we ooo, you're gon' want to pay back tithes

Cuz you don't wanna lose your ride to the next guy
And baby trouble only makes for a good time

I got it bad for him in the worst way
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this position and
I shoulda have never got involved in the first place
But second place never get the recognition, hmm
See what he doin' to me make have to shout it out
Got a hold on me, that's without a doubt
So clear now that he's a trouble starter
But I ain't a saint neither and these ain't no still waters

[Bridge: Jennifer Hudson]
Just cause all the girls are falling at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me
Till you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me

Till you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me

Came in at first, had bad luck
Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had nothin'
We done sold out, now everybody mad at me
Tell 'em roll out, now everybody smashin'
Get ready cause you know we 'bout to be a problem
Hope you ready cause you know it 'bout to be a problem

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes
Paper chase, vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, boy, better check your tone
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me
Preferably one of the best
She ridin' cause we next now and forever to death
Be loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest
We just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever

Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together

[Verse 2: Wale]
Got no time to waste
And no way these niggas stoppin' me, oh no
Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
And I can do this with my eyes closed
Blindfold two times over
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over
Talkin' on Melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's a flea to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
That's cold-blooded
And I've been this dope for like four summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake
I know this shit that bone you pick
Might leave you niggas fillets

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together

[Verse 3: YG]
It's YG 4hunnid!
Is you ridin'?
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence
If Jimmy got caught up, but you was right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet??
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake-friend syndrome
There's no cure so them symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be something
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this, this, and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker
For me and my day one hittas

Seinfield: Getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster
And you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal
'Chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, ""What, what's going on here,"" You know?
""Boy this thing is really, really goes high!""
Wale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!'
Seinfield: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming
Wale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?
Seinfield: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new. You're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person

Couldn't make you wait forever, for forever
This is forever

If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 1: Wale]
(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

[Pre-Hook 1: Wale]
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin', ""let him go""
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though

Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote
Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

[Pre-Hook 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

[Hook: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it

Baby, I've been making plans, oh baby
I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Outro: Wale]
We ain't nothin' but some planets

Seinfield: I always feel like I’m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, “Hey, I think I can jump across.”"

I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway

With those tattoos on your face?
Say, boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem
To be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked, so I might say something back
That might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or what I have to
Say on the mic, then you might wanna act just
Like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause
I'm a sinner, and I, I got a best friend, best friend
Plus balls and intestines, and they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up the minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
'Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nuttin', you ain't my best friend, best friend
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a best friend, best friend
Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power, now
When I blackout, power outage—oww
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you—blaow
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option
Somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it

When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit

930,PlanezJeremih,"[Intro]
This one goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that playa-ass nigga Thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride
Where playa-hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame muh'fuckers can barely survive

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big, when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
Hope it ain't talk, no

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I could put you in the Mile High Club
What's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read ""The World Is Yours""
On a blimp?

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Tell her be free, baby, spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30,000 feet
On your knees in them Pradas
Makin' freaky shit come up out her

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Get high, baby, roll one
Cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land, we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know 'bout
Tonight, we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear

Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far, my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo'd yo bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thing in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn, don't make me beg
But I will if I need to, 'cause for real, girl, I need you
I could put you on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit, I got a pill I could feed you

Nigga she don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all in the club reppin' like she my bitch
Nigga that's my shit, you can't stand it but that's my shit
Don't need to be dramatic but that's my shit

She met you while tryna find me
Try to never mind me
Ain't gotta remind me boy that's my shit

You tryna make her wyl out, I just make 'em wyl out
I put that pussy in your brain, you put that pussy in a drought
I make 'em wanna stay, you just make 'em wanna leave
She want me to put a ring on it, but you still wanna be seen
We've been place that you'll never, ever, ever go
I know shit about her that you'll never, ever, ever know
I know how to push that button, trust me I'm just fuckin'
And you gone say that you don't care but I know you give a fuck

[Hook: The-Dream]

[Verse 2: TI]
I call and she comin', you call, hit the button
Love it when I shove it and I have it all in her stomach
You the type to act ""why you ain't call me or nothin'?""
And I wouldn't have that bitch in the mall with me for nothin'
You keep petty conversation
We know two words, orgasm and penetration
Bitch naw, ball to the wall, goin' all in
Send her ass back to ya, hope you fall in
Kick it with her ratchet friend, you too (?) to know
Push it to the club and got 'em all in, scrub
That anything that you would give one day
To know the life a real nigga live one day
Know what it like when niggas fuck with you for real for running yay
And can still hit the streets and get a mil in one day"

Tired of hearing about it

Pass them all around, they at every party
They ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody
Still I love these hoes

Oh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry
Don't bring her around, this just too much money
Yeah I love these hoes

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
She's a super freak, super freak
Met her in Liv last week
She was in there with Meek
In VIP, then she left with me
She said she fuck with Breezy
Do I wanna keep it? Nah, that ho too sleazy
Now she fuck with Jeezy
Don't believe me? The shit's all over TV
Now she work the pole, but you ain't know
That's how she make her dough
Seen her in New York
She was all throwed, forgot we met before
She say she fuck with Drake
I ain't surprised, all these hoes fucking with Drake
I asked why she out this way
Said she on a date, then she left with Trey
When will niggas learn?
Hoes like a doorknob, everybody gets a turn
Chicks be so high-class on the internet
But don't got shit she earned
She got that bag from Juicy J
She got that ass from Rudy Gay
Now your silly ass down on one knee

Man, I fell in love with a stripper
Funny thing is I fell back out of love quicker
They don't pay attention to love anyway
They only concerned with what the haters say
Bottles be turnin these girls into thots
Instagram turnin these wifes into hoes
No real life they just readin the comments
Mess with a real one and get you exposed
I had a time when my mind was caught up
My niggas was lookin like what is he on
My family was too scared to talk to a nigga
Ain't comin back now the case just got closed
She do what she told
Sharin' is carin' that pussy ain't gold
Sorry you ain't in control
You all about that money, thats shit that I throw
Just make sure you clean off that pole
They turn on the TV and get on the gram
And say that's relationship goals
Trust me don't save em' anything goes with...

This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Yeah, you my prototype
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche four door, white (TRU)
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her, I'm tryna knock up
I'm tryna put a singer in her so I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender, thank God for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Tryna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, ""Don't mess around with them pitbulls""

[Hook: B.o.B]
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, ""do it for me, baby""
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
This the endin' from the N9ne
Grindin' bitches from behind
If you way drunk off the 'gnac
Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up!
This Kan' City, shit's ran gritty
In the summertime the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Everybody got they hands up like (whoa!)
See a bad bitch like (ohh!)
This whole damn city fuckin' go
But this is how the hood go crazy in the Mo

[Hook: B.o.B]
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, ""do it for me, baby""
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)

College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy"

Toss the money in the air, girl

Killin' someone's vibe should be a fuckin' crime
Wasted so much time, should be a fuckin' crime

942,CoffeeMiguel,"[Intro]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments in vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Verse 1]
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, baptism
Peach colored skies we feel the sunrise
Two lost angels discover salvation
Don't you wish we could run away now?
Yes, let's
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Partial Pre-Chorus]
Wordplay, turns into gun play (Yeah baby, when we face the sun)
And gun play turns into pillow talk (You'll know for sure)
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams (That I'm all yours)
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning (All yours darling)

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning (Woman, do you know what you've done to me baby?)
I don't wanna wake you (Stay darling)
I just wanna watch you sleep (Stay darling, yeah)
It's the smell of your hair (No, babe)
And it's the way that we feel (Never know how it feels)
I've never felt comfortable (Feel like this, woman)

[Chorus]
Turns into coffee in the morning (You'll never be the end)
Coffee in the morning (You'll never be the end of me)
I don't wanna wake you (You'll never be the end of me, darling)
I just wanna watch you sleep (Yeah baby, be the end of me, baby)
It's the smell of your hair (No, babe)
And it's the way that we feel (Never felt like this, woman)
I've never felt comfortable like this (Feel like this, darling, no)

[Outro: Miguel]
All right, old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Two lost angels discover salvation
Under glass pink skies watching the sunlight
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Fucking in the morning)
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism

Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye"

We've been driving for a while and

I've seen a lot of valleys and mountains
I've seen a lot of falls and fountains
And no matter the storms, we made it through

You want somewhere to go, here's someone to walk you
You want someone to hug you and you know that they care
You want someone to ask and is always there
A roof over your head and provide you a meal
Who always get [?]

Up and down, back and forth, so ratchet when you 'posed to be
A lady to the naked eye but a nasty lil ho to me

Manhandle you in public places, I make you take it right here
You got no idea (idea), listen, girl, with this pole right here, ow
Beat it up, be grabbing hair, leaving hand prints on your derrière (yeah)
Now can you just kiss it for me
While I'm doing 'bout a hundred on the highway?
Get it sloppy wet, get it bent

Be talking 'bout me, I highly doubt it
So, let me take you to a private island
Make you take this dick, don't cry about it
How it feel to you, girl? Don't lie about it
No, shawty, you ain't gotta lie about it
Blacking out in that pussy like a power outage
Got a man, well he gonna be sour 'bout it
But I just wanna be on your team
Provide you with your protein
Leave wet dreams all in your face
Them tattoos all over your waist
Got me rock solid, come touch that
I'm fucking you like I'm upset
Choking you, long stroking you
Say you came twice, not enough yet
Because a cat that fat is very rare
And my dick ought to be buried there
I love how you kick it in public
But in private, we on some wild shit (hahaha)

947,Me U & HennessyDeJ Loaf,"[Verse]
Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
This drink got me feelin' right
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin' and spinnin' me
My head keep on spinnin', my legs keep on shakin'
But my head keep on spinnin'
I'm out of my mind, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin'
I throw it back, and you catch my driftin'
You shiftin' inside you got me screamin'
You got me yellin' out yo name, ooh, I need you
You kiss on my thighs and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I lovin' this ride, smooth like a Bimmer
Smooth like that Henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I'm not gonna lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons

[Chorus]
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you

[Outro]
You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy, and you
Ayy, ayy, this what happens when we drinkin'
Me, Hennessy, and you

948,EverydayA$AP Rocky,"[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, ""Holler if ya need some dick""
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
""Hood dudes usually don't look like you""
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', ""Pimp Squad, hold it down!""
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

[Chorus: Miguel & Rod Stewart]
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I got the lovebirds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow"

I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say ""I love you""
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, ""I really wanna let it go""

I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home

Heard he bought you a bag for a G
Why you fuckin' with them broke niggas?

Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!

Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?

Counting all this bread, I don't talk to feds
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head
Cause baby you the baddest, all this money, I'ma cash it

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?

Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They say I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church have you wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble, I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game, Philly as shit
Look at these rappers, they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose, came up from nothing
And now they like, ""How he made millions so quick?""
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca, no way

Uh, niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me, that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
250 thou what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game 'til FOX be on
CNN, momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything, got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Stick and moving on these niggas, get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler, that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its 80 mil, pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it

Poured a 8th of Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me, now it's hard to keep this shit together

Jump out the Rari then jump out the Wraith

Came from the hood now we jump out of states
Peep all these diamonds, they jump out the face
Ducking indictments and selling this white
Got to watch for these niggas they'll jump on your case

Fuck with my dawg, knock a chunk out ya face

Went and bought me a safe and it came with a Wraith

Get out your feelings, young nigga let's get it

Watching my stacks and my shoes

We was rocking them Loubs
If I got to lose it's not by the rules
Get hit with that chopper knock right out your shoes
Shawty so proper she look like a goddess
When I dip inside her it's just like a pool
I bought some Rarris and I bought some Phantoms
And then dropped out the seat like I dropped out of school
Still will pull up on you hop out with goons
Thirty-two shots let it pop out the tool

I just took a perc now I'm on another level
Tasting on the molly got me dancing with the devil
Poured  8th of Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me now its hard to keep this shit together

A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

974,Back To BackDrake,"[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

[Chorus]
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)"
975,Straight Outta ComptonN.W.A,"[Intro: Dr. Dre]
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

[Interlude: Eazy E (MC Ren)]
Yo, Ren! (Whassup?)
Tell 'em where you from!

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum, and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming…

[Verse 3: Eazy E]
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

Damn, that shit was dope!"
976,Boyz-N-The HoodEazy-E,"[Verse 1]
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Yo, man!
Get the fuck out!
Pump that bass!
Mothafucker, say what?

[Verse 2]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal an Alpine
Chased him up the streets to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge
One sucka dead, LA Times front page

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Yo, Leroy!
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin'
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Who do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?
Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way

[Verse 4]
I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said ""Oh, brother.""
I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another
Walkin' home, I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy he'll do some time

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

L.A. playa
Big Drum Beater

[Verse 5]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
The fellas causin' a riot in the county jail
Two days later in the municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
""Disruption of the court,"" said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""Fire!"", then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card

I don't wanna hear all that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' commas, how much you need and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 2: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 3: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was ""what's the hold up?""
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope

Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

[Verse 1: The Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?""
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me

L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 3: The Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me

I had to change the safe, I had to change my bitch
Money'll change a nigga, the fame'll change a bitch
I know I came from poverty, I got my name from poverty
I know for sure, for sure
If my granddad was livin', I know he'd be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Snupe was living, I know he'd be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Lonzo was livin', he never would've doubted me
I know for sure, for sure
I live with these diamonds, just check out my clarity
Gotta just check out these clarity
I get so fly like a parachute
I pull up right now and embarrass you
I sold the crack on my avenue
Only the strong survive
I'm just enjoying my life

[Chorus]
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hope out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi

[Verse 2]
I ran it up with the same niggas
Get that money and stay with the same niggas
I know that money can change niggas
They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
Hop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it
Sell all the dope out them apartments, I did it
I'm 'bout to cut off some niggas I know that ain't with me
Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas
That get it and niggas who strive
And the real niggas is all they come across, yeah
I know either way it goes, Sunny gon' be there
I know either way it goes, Doe Boy gon' be there (Young Metro!)
Even when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there
I be pourin' up this 4, they thought we wouldn't be here
I told you, come a time when we had to persevere
I knew there'd come a time when we'd all be here

[Chorus]
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe

I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When I met her she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said ""Whatever"" 'cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just want ten thousand followers
Lord, she posted, she posted, she posted
They like it, they like it, repost it
She party promotin', she hostin'
She posin', legs open, provokin'
It got my head smokin'
I tried to act like I don't notice
Emotions, emotions, emotions, lord

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I had to leave that ho alone and get my mind right
I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and find light
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight
Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out
When I met her she was posse'd up
In the section holding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be popular
Oh, she just want ten thousand followers

[Bridge : Charlie Puth]
I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But Oh, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

[Hook: Charlie Puth (Lil Wayne)]
I'm facing the bottle
(I'm sipping and lighted and dipping in line, but I'm coping)
For all of my problems (I'm too open)
These Instagram models (Glad I left her)
Are nothing but trouble (But I don't know her Lord)
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble"

I was innocent then, I ain’t do no wrong
She said, “you mommy little man,” I said, “yep, uh huh”
She was everything to me, when she came, I just lit up
Sunday morning I was so sharp, all did up
It was welfare or hustlin', they killed her for that
The first shot, bullet wound in my back
I’m fucked up, look at my sneakers, I’m fucked up
Now I’m on my own, mommy gone
Sam said, “you a young boy, why your clothes look so old?
You don’t need fish, little nigga, you need a pole
You need no new kicks, you need an O”
Chop that, bag it, get right back at it
That touched me, it hit me in my heart
I’m a hustler, homie, you was giving me my start
I am what I am, Sabrina’s only baby
Practicing in the mirror, pulling out my .380
Oh man, I fucked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will, see
Seven grams of cocaine, three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Look, I’m outta control, my gun go
Off like it’s legal, call the cops, you need to
Give ‘em my description, I ain’t bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn’t last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left, in case niggas try to get me
That’s nine shots, we just call it Fifty

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much too hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change

[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 2]
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, ""Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout""
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops

I went to the moped store, said ""Fuck it""
And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe (Downtown)

Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow
You can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

I hustle the first to the first

They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed up with racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack and I'm muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work, it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes, I keep 'em comin'
Fuck all these bitches, I keep 'em comin'
I pull up right now, I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You can't come around here, 'cause it's dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that car, trick
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got Bape on my back with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she latch on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom? We did it
I see how they counted us out
Bet they never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I poured up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it?
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treat me
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons

I did the digital dash

And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure

I might could fit you in on Wednesday

Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies

I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask

Cuban links hanging on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see heron everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean, I ain't started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean, my nigga still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that's gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just paid their bills now

[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
I still taste you on my lips, yeah yeah I do
Last night we made love until the sun came
I know it's hard when I leave, I'm not with you
But when I'm gone, hold it down, you're my love thing
You be doin' it, that one and two, that four thing
Let's slow it down a bit, I'll hit you with that foreplay
Hop on top, I start to ride you, that's that horseplay
Strip for my baby, bitch we ballin', that's that sports play
I love you, I love you
I feel it all in my stomach
You a monster, baby, baby I want you
I'm starin' you in the eyes and tellin' you that I want it
No shame in my game, I'm a feind, I'm a junkie
You need a line of my love, put this pussy all on you

Who's knockin' at the door? My legs locked right now

[Verse 2: Future]
I ain't tryna spare you, baby, ain't no tire in my trunk
I get to come at you at least a hundred times out the month
Soon as you wake, baby, ride on me, just for breakfast
Paparazzi wastin' time if they're tryna catch us
I done hit her with a new wave, she go crazy about the D
And say fuck the earth, it's us against everybody
You on a team now, baby, yeah Pat Riley
You with a king now, it's only right you shine like a queen

[Bridge: Future]
And I still taste you on my lips, oh yeah I do
When we make love we on the top of the moon
But that oh, oh say my name now
Put my nose in that pussy, give you head now
She know I get that moola, man trappin' is a habit
We ballin' every night, baby, woah Kemosabe
Ain't no shame in my game, I'm a fiend, I'm a addict
Whoever knockin' at the door, I told 'em I got to have it
What's poppin'?

1007,30 For 30 FreestyleDrake,"[Verse]
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But, I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But, I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga
Out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer to My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
Guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna
See you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put their arm around you
Now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they care to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton
This ain't that local action
The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things
You niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit
When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was poppin' off with ""Ain't I""
Way before niggas had they hands out
Like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know"
1008,Drink You AwayJustin Timberlake,"[Verse 1]
Bittersweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain, tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that we've made

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, now tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Verse 2]
Got that poundin' on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you can find me doin' the same
'Cause I just can't forget, the way we turned out this bad
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, now tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Bridge]
Break it down
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, so tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, oh yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Oh yeah, tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in"

Tongue on her body, see you later, alligator (woo)
Rolling 'round in the bed, smacking her on her ass
She a stone-cold killer, .45 in the bag
Mama told her never mess with a nigga like me (like me)
I took her to Fruit Town to meet my OG
I took her to the west side, like, ""What's up?""
We was on the east side, we fucked
Now we sitting court-side, P-dub

Okay now, what the fuck they talkin' 'bout?

Yeah, you know we balling out, peace and love

You fuck bitches and get money, that's wassup
It's all good, but all these people do not give a fuck
And now I bet they bitchin' cause my flow switchin'

Can't they just be happy I no longer have to face eviction?

I'm livin' out my inner vision right now

1012,The MonsterEminem,"[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?

Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now

I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third

Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights

1015,White WallsMacklemore,"[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
Q

[Chorus: Hollis]
Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright"

One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris, boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'

You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over

Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

And we're stupid and contagious

Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water

And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah

And you play this game in spite to drive me insane

I love when you pulling up in your jeep
Pumping all your beats
J's on, with your shades on
Just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets
But when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing no
Baby, hop up in my ride
Ooh, it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down
With the doors closed
Put your hand on my thigh
Drive slow ooh

""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?"
1027,All Of MeJohn Legend,"[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me

You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

Already got one, rolled up in my left hand
Pussy on my mind, tighter than a headband
Kush in my lungs, got ganja in my sweat glands
This shit I'm on, better than the next strand
Than the next strand, better than the next strand
She head down, booty poppin' in a handstand
I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man
I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback
Like a cornerback, that's an interception
You think I give a fuck, that's a misconception
Oh what a night, oh what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I said, oh what a night, oh what a night
Yeah she a bad bitch, all jokes aside

[Hook]
Hey, look at baby over there
Wassup, little mama come here
She started talking but I really couldn't hear
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror
Like she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Like she do it in the mirror

Chop one, chop two, chop that ass down
Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down
Drop drop that ass down, now look back at it

Whistling Dixie
Middle school, I was getting head on a ten speed
Gigolo blood line, pimpin' hereditary
Black on 28's, it remind of February
Day you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary
Dead ass rapper should have came with a cemetery
I am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry
Fill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary
My vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'
I've been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin'
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her ass would knock your ass out, you better stick and move
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs so sexy when I'm in-between

[Hook]
Hey, look at baby over there
Wassup, little mama come here
She started talking but I really couldn't hear
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror
Like she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Like she do it in the mirror


[Verse 3: B.o.B]
She do it like she do it in the mirror
Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here
I tell her like, do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there
Now make a nigga feel welcome like a doormat's there
I'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night
That's a bad bitch, all jokes aside

Hey, look at baby over there
Wassup, little mama come here

But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement  just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well

That's got all you niggas excited

I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult
Girl, I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go? 'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

Where did you go? It just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

1035,BerzerkEminem,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud

But she lied to you if she said I paid for it
Nigga 99 broads, 99 broads
Panoramic view from the 99th floor
I'm like 'my Lord' when she down on all fours
Got a hood bitch with me, she ain't scared of taking charge
Flying by in a car, you ain't know what you saw
She adjusting her bra as I’m lighting up a cigar
They was writing me off, now I arrive like a star
I just sit back and laugh the irony of it all
Let them bands go, let them bands go
Watch a nigga throw a grand or so on that camel toe
And be like 'Damn boy, why you cuffing that whore?'
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know

Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation

How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans

Okay, I don't remember where we first met

And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

You know when I hold you, you won’t be alone
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me

Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past

Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup...

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Give me your old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone...

So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all"

'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I’m gonna run run away (oh I), run run away, run away (oh I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (well all right)
Run run away, run run away (oh I), run away (oh I-I-I)
Show ‘em that your color is black (well all right)

Damned if I do

You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli

This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch in his ear
Sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—what she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose

Why did we go all the way?
What do we do, ohhh, when it rains?

When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

[Verse 1: Future]
Hold on, hold on, hold up Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie, dog, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And Imma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, you give it time, time reveals

We've been in the same place, for a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way, I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time

[Verse 3: Future]
Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody never love you more than me
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'

And I can fight temptations off
I ain't soft, no I ain't soft

Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)

That's my swag, you should pay me
Ain't that the truth?
This is my whip, ain't that the coupe?

You are now welcomed to the kush lounge
So miss me with that fuckery
Girl, come here with that suckery

When all along, I knew I shoulda stayed right where I wasn't
Instead of drive and think of you
So I'm just...

[Pre-Chorus]
Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I can’t even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back
Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute, baby
Going too fast, I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home"

Take off those heels
Lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins
But we don't even care
Candles drippin' on your body
Baby this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we've run off to
My body on your body, baby, stickin' like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty
Girl, it's only one or two
Fever's fucking running
Feel the heat between us two

And we can go slow
Yeah we can go slow

Like you right there
Don't have to say it twice
Love, there's nothing here to fear
Takin' it back, back to where it's clear
Rollin' on and on sounds of love are in the air

I'm just comin' down from this

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ride

On you baby, on you lady
All night, all night

Click my link and spread your buns
Lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it, baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)

Sword in my hand, I fight like this

Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say ""Doo-doo, doo-doo,"" bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, on forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!

Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Faded, faded, faded, right?
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
Stick it up your SoutHside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year

Smokin' weed and drinkin', all the college students lovin' Q

Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
'Cause you got me face down

And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts, I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?

You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up?
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special

Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em
He one nights 'em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

1067,From TimeDrake,"[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Part 2: ***Flawless]

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' 'round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say ""I look so good tonight""
God damn, God damn
Say ""I look so good tonight""
God damn, God damn, God damn!

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Mama taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless

He got older but never grew
For his life he can't tell the truth
How to love he ain't got a clue
Playing games like he'll never lose you
Try to talk to him can't get through
Every day he's a different dude
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just trying to keep it real

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man

Coming home any time at night
Expecting you to let it ride
How many tears are you gonna cry?
Playing games like he'll never lose you
You know that the love is changed
How many times he called you out your name?
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just keeping it real

You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy

Gonna take more than a miracle
To change him just let him go
Tell me when will you decide
To do better with your life?
If his momma couldn't do it, what makes you think
You can train a boy to be a man? It's too late
Better off letting him go
No matter how hard you try, you can't raise

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you

If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man"

What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but

[Outro: Beyoncé]
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away

I love the way you keep them heels on
Hair ain't yours but it’s paid for and it’s real long
Show them tattoos when you switch it up with your J's on
And you got an ass so fat that I can’t help but feel on
And you keep it real when it comes to having sex, girl you don’t ever flex
Long as I fuck you good, you ain’t worried 'bout what’s next
That’s why I keep you here, you ain’t like them other hoes
Cause you the fucking best, just in case you didn’t know

She G-H-E-TT-O, my little buddy, my little hoe
Been fucking with her since I was in high school, she had my heart and secrets too
She was born and raised in the projects, never listen to what a guy said
She been going through shit, I can tell, because her eyes red
Her heart hurt, it been beat up, I wanna start over, don't mislead ya
I cross my heart like I pledge allegiance, I give my all if you don’t leave me

1084,For The Rest Of My LifeRobin Thicke,"[Verse 1]
I knew when I laid my eyes on you
The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was fly
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain’t even 20 baby
I ain’t learned to love you right yet
Good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind

[Hook]
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I’m gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

[Verse 2]
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I sang ""Forever My Lady"" and kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I’d be playing basketball or something like that in the park
Then I messed up like boys tend to do
It’d be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
Cause I’d never be the man that I am today

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn’t even old enough to drive a car
I saw my only chance to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy’s car
Cause no one’s ever gonna love you baby
Better than I do

Gangster so flashy, Louis Vuitton magnum

I drop the white crease, call it dope boy magic
Dopeology, you should take one of my classes
Hit me in the hood, red carpet, pants saggin
Rob you on Front Street in 75 classic
My potnahs know I'm good in the hood besides rappin
I got trap money cabin, it's 30 if you askin
D trap money lavish, ain't gotta make it rappin
Fruity bezel the cabbage, them country niggas taxin
Ballin like Maverick, blowin loud in the traffic
I robbed a nigga twosie in some Rap Lord fashion
Say young'n in the hood, I'm a trap money addict
Cartier glasses, you see that I got money
I wake up early in the mornin I need me some trap money

Look I ain't got no record deal so no it ain't no rap money
You see the stack in my jeans, I can't fit no rubber band
22 on cents, I'ma wrap it 'round them
And first I unload the tractor, bust 'em out the wrapper
Get 'em to my trappers and they bring me back them rat chicks
Bust off goin fast, you can call it cheetah girl
When I get the panky you know I'm water whippin her
No top on the whip, tank top Louis V
You can call me tank top cause all I do is wifebeat
Talkin smart on the phone, price just gone up
Take it or leave it homeboy, either way I give a fuck
Pot cold, LB's, kush by the O-Z's
Yeah I sell 'em for the low and get 'em for the dirt cheap
Get in just how you want, I'm a walkin trap sto'
Well connected nigga courtesy of my amigos
Flyin down 20 East, trunk full of dirty birdies
In the middle of the drought we let them bitches fly for 30
In the kitchen cuttin work I gotta do my two-step
Yeah I'm bad leg trappin, bring it to your front stop
Now I'm on Y-65, just got off I-10
In the handicap van, fill it up with midgets man

Ten bands, all tens, nigga that's my trap money

1086,Cold BloodYo Gotti,"[Intro]
Poverty's paradise
If you want it, you'd better think twice

[Hook: Canei Finch]
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, but how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
In a nigga, yeah, no love in a nigga
If I could paint a picture, I'd show a image
Of a dog ass nigga, yeah, a raw ass nigga
Popping pain killers, riding for the cause
Four dogs with them pistols, na-na-natural born killers
He sold crack to his mother, turned his back on his brothers
Killed his partner for the plug, he think everything a hustle
Co-cold muh'fucka, holmes numb
Black heart, no feelings, just a gun, fo'real
He was raised in the trenches
Not to mention, all the hoes they had dissed him
So holmes think the whole world against him
Played ball, coach benched him, grandpa, Klan lynched him
He was raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
Kinda hard to adapt
So holmes turned to a strap
Didn't succeed, tried rap, couldn't fight, got slapped
Shot dice, do crap, did time, back out, damn

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, no love, no love
How you gon' survive now? No love, no love
Yo Gotti, lemme paint a picture for these niggas, hey, huh
Here’s a, voice for the voiceless
My words like, multiple choice to the choiceless
Emerge like, a searchlight in the darkness for this young black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces or they corpses now
In God we trust, but it’s bucks that we worship now
Boy, that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
See I seen just what that fast money gon’ come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit, he said, “Let's go and do the sequel”
But his, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it now
Feeling guilty, what would momma think about me?
Told 'em, ""Think about it, nigga, won't you think about it now?""
But he was money hungry, plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy, burners packed just like a stadium
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial like her baby boy on trial
For a murder that he ain’t commit, tears soak the handkerchief

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Fo'real, fo'real
Lights off, no candles, roaches all around the kitchen
Nigga hungry, mom embarrassed so she don't want us to mention it
Grandma wanna help but momma ego kicking in
She a hustler, she don’t need no help raising her kids
Bills came, got evicted, stayed strong
Square business, she ain’t never showed weakness, real shit
That created the hunger, and that make the monsters
Got the game from our momma, that’s some ill shit
Thirteen on the block, he was a lookout
In the kitchen, on the stove like it’s a cookout
Young nigga mastered the game, could put a book out
Right when he thought it was over, he got took out (bang!)
Brains leaking, nigga sneaked him, he ain't even seen it coming
He a hitta, he wasn't focus so he died over nothing
No revenge, with his friends shooting dice, bet again
Win or lose, take it all, took out by his own men

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Outro: J. Cole]
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday
Oh, we can fly someday
Yeah, up in the sky someday, mm
Do real niggas get to Heaven? That’s that shit I ask the reverend
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me

If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big

Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hidin'?

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!""
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

I be everywhere, everybody know me
Super, super fresh with a dope styling
Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck
Givenchy keep the chicks in check
All these car keys drive them chicks to my crib
Dru Hill? Got somebody sleeping on my bed
She give me IQ, that mean she give me head
I just give her beats, I don't give her bread
'Cause we be in the club, bottles on deck
And god dammit, god dammit I'm feelin' myself
'Cause I'm gon' get it all, and I'ma throw it up
Like god dammit, god dammit, I'm feelin' myself

And I done seen me slidin' out my dope ride
I open up the doors, suicide
I came from the bottom, the sewer side
I made it to the top cause I do it fly
Feelin' fuckin' lucky like the fuckin' Irish
I see the whole game from my third iris
I tour the whole word like a dirty pirate
To give the whole club some Miley Cyrus

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus]
Now everybody trippin' like they poppin' molly
Up in the club, is where you'll find me
I do it real big never do it tiny
If you about that bullshit please don't remind me

Shake, shake that shit like a, like an expert
Shake, shake that shit like a, like an expert

Doobie in my hand, Rollie on my wrist
Got a bottle of that thousand dollar champagne in my fist
Women in your dreams sleep in my bed
So I don't need your brains I need my ass kissed
But all my homies like give me some head
Smoke joints till our eyes turn Indian red
Takes shots till our chests burn
We got papers, bottles, mollies, all this let's get it started
The bigger the bill, the bigger you ball
The bigger the watch, the bigger the car, the bigger the star
The bigger the chain, the farther you go, you already know
The bigger the bank, that's more hoes, nigga
And I done spent a quarter milli' on clothes
Coppin' them old schools and puttin' foreigns on the road
Real talk and if my fuel get low
I roll up another joint take a shot and reload, pow

And it ain't no mistake that I'm this good
I just done seen seen a lot, you know what I'm talking about

You gotta feel it, lil nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I got my own voice, sing my own hooks
Fresh fade, nice smile, got my own look
I just like to make people happy
Four kids, I just like being a good daddy
But I'm a gangsta and I rock shows
A people person, so you know Lil Boosie got hoes
Damn, hoes, that's a figure of speech
Get a lotta shit like that when you listen to me
As for my fans, I love y'all
Straight up, y'all a part of me, so when they hate, they hate us
Money keep a nigga going to better things
Mane, I take it to the bank, I don't make it rain
But I'm fly like Weezy
Plus, the hood niggas, man, they believe me like Jeezy
And I just like to have a good time
Hit the yo, smoke one, and put my life in my rhymes

Father, forgive me, I was raised on some real shit
So I can't sugarcoat shit, not a lil bit
Inside, I'm sad 'bout my dad
Since I lost my grams, ain't been giving a damn
But I still hold my head high, and sometimes I cry
But when I cry, mane, I don't know why
I feel trapped to be a superstar
A hundred thousand worth of jewelry to end it
And I spend it, with no problem
You don't like Badazz, then that's your problem
M.O.B., wouldn't give a damn if the hoes holla
Love cars, love broads, with a passion
I ain't never have shit, so I'm flashy
I work hard, go and get it on the road
Seven month run, 750 out for shows, get it?
I'm hood rich, still smoking that good shit
Still got the same hood clique

[Hook: Lil Boosie and Kiara]
We gon' show the world

[Verse 3: Webbie]
I told my teacher to her eyes, I'mma make it there
She ain't even look surprised, gave me another F
Or a fucking D, happy you got a C
Fuck the world and be whatever you wanna be
Ain't nothing like a strong mind and some confidence
Whenever you step outta line, it's a consequence
We all overseas, we puffing weed
We'll make you niggas bleed, yes in-fucking-deed
747, yelling 747
On the real, we gotta be a couple miles from heaven
The world tried to pull us down, but we ain't fucking let it
I woulda did some of it different, but I don't regret it
That's one thing about me, though, I never been a quitter
That's seizure shit, crazy, shout out to the hospital
Rest in peace, ma, I'mma be on TV
Young Savage, Sweet Jones, Trill Family

[Hook: Lil Boosie and Kiara]
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler

Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked (Yeah?)
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok (Yeah?)
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP

Different color, my passport

Ain't nobody sicker in my Fisker, “vroom-vroom,” ho
Ain't nobody—
(Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know)
Top of the holy totem
Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, trippin' off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-KKK
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whippin' a Kia
Spendin' this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
“Err-eh-err-eh,” onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on! (Tailor-made!)
I'm winnin' so they had to dump the Gatorade (Gatorade)
And I don't give a fuck about my family name

Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do? (What?!)"

You said you'd never ever break... down
But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play... to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...

[Hook: Wrekonize & Kendall Morgan]
We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Some of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die
N9na be givin the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'ma look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real - I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm

[Hook Wrekonize & Kendall Morgan]
We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile

I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop...
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop...
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music

Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feelin' Hoover
She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample
That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burnin', we smokin'
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back in case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearin' the word is
Me, I'm a P.I.M.P

But when she get to workin' her hips, you know the temperature rise
Oh Lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinkin' damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation, pimpin' ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumpin' crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs
Luther said it: a house is not a home without her
I had 'em panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits
Her wantin' is temporary 'cause for sure she gon' get it, wassup

1114,It's On AgainAlicia Keys,"[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]
[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]
I'll simply say ""it's on again, it's on again,"" whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
[When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say ""it's on again, it's on again,"" whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say ""it's on again, it's on again,"" whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh"

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""

Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

1118,Slave To The RhythmMichael Jackson,"[Verse 1]
She dances in the sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

[Verse 2]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
""Sir, I must be home tonight""
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm

[Bridge]
She works so hard, just to make a way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus]
Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

[Verse 1]
Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin' wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'ma keep it movin' be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you, when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

[Verse 2]
Yo
People'll love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga's life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish wit' you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills, on 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
Pills 'n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills 'n' potions
We're overdosin'

1120,WorkIggy Azalea,"[Intro]
Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through

[Verse 1]
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

[Pre-Chorus]
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
16 in the middle of Miami

[Chorus]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

[Verse 2]
You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At four in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!

You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels

[Pre-Chorus]
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
16 in the middle of Miami

[Chorus]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

[Verse 3]
Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn first at the light that's in front me
'Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need
'Cause it's all that I ever had

[Outro]
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit"

I don't know what these niggas speakin' off

Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't

Money won't ease us
Man niggas even hated on Jesus
Living life on the road on the chase for the money

Ain't no love in the streets
Let her run into me and she wanted to meet
Now she fuck with a G
Got your bitch not wanting to speak
Hold up, y'all mahfuckers tried to shit on us
Chain all lit all up
Porsche with the horse like get on up
And my bitch got that shit on her
Rock Balmain cause I'm ballin'
I put red bottoms on red models
And no more red bottles
Straight Belarie nigga every bottles
Ricky Rozay we in here
Double M G we've been here
Straight from the north side
Right by the project how did I get here
Sippin' on lean with a bad ass bitch
From the Hills, probably live there
And get money like me
And the pussy so wet I need swimwear
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Suicide doors, riding around with a suicide whore
There's no love in the streets and this blood on my sneaks got suicide on them
Going everywhere you are not going
Doing everything you are not doing
And I've been out to get it and you mention my niggas that's suicide on them
Right back to the money my nigga no we don't play
Say my name and that's D.O.A
And all these chains is saying we okay
And we drink Champagne, eat Frito Lays
At lunchtime, do it for the ghetto one time
I don't even know how to tell time, look at our time
Cause the watch say bust down and the whole band is drumline
Me and my nigga, Rozay that's my nigga
D-Boy, that's my hitter
You ain't doing wrong, as long as you don't touch my hitter
South finger fuck my trigger, smoking on strong
None of y'all can fuck with us
None of y'all gossip, Jigga
Give me my throne, and you ain't gonna like my picture
Leave a comment, fuck nigga
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

I don't know what these niggas speakin' off

Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal

You must be suicidal
When we pull up, watch the suicide doors

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shit ain't been the same since I came through in that hot shit
They gon' talk about you 'til you ain't got shit
Still gon' talk about you when you got shit
All eyes on Meek, I'm on my Pac shit
Y'all rap niggas on some pop shit
I've been duckin' paparazzi with a pop bitch
Glock .30 in the cockpit
Sippin' dirty, conversatin' with the pilot
Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been fuckin' up arenas
I'm with double M, the genius
We the motherfuckin' meanest
And the cleanest in a long time
You pussy niggas hatin' on me picked the wrong time
Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
Blood drippin' on me lookin' like a nigga stabbed him
I be on the money, bakin' soda in the cabinet
Pyrex, tryna whip a Rollie, makin' magic
Laughin' at you fuck niggas gettin' madder
If I feel threatened, I'ma go and get a ladder
And climb up your chest, nigga
Motherfuck your vest, nigga
Motherfuck your couch, I'm with Khaled, the best, nigga

Shit startin' to change, so you startin' to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'

They don't love you no more, nah

Bullet in the head, they wanna see my shirt red
Live by the code, it's the only way to play it
Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated
Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'd take it
Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
God is the greatest as I'm prayin' in the latest
X600 as I swerve, Little Haiti
Ou paka bat m'wen, sak pase!
I'm bustin' out the sunroof, nigga, ¡andalé!
My money always comin', no, I'm never on pause
They bring it straight to your door if you a mothafuckin' boss
Let's ride

Hol' up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?
Ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?
Are you sure? A nigga flip this shit like Jarl Borg
A nigga did this shit, this hardcore
If you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, I mean but who knows?
Salute to all the real niggas out there findin' the loopholes
Fuck all these fuck niggas, hate when niggas come up, igh!
Hopped off the plane, hit the helicopter (igh!)
Tell these crabs in the barrel we eatin' hella lobster (igh!)
Got hella options, like a college team
Hit these bootleg niggas with the Heisman
Fuck the NCAA, nigga!
Let a young nigga get paid, nigga!
Niggas talkin' down on the crown
Watch them niggas you 'round got you wound
Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string
Wrong sport, boy, you know you soft as a lacrosse team

1130,ChicagoMichael Jackson,"[Verse 1]
I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I
So I asked her for her name

She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me

[Chorus 1]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(She was wanting me)
She said just to give her a place
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I never would have thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(She was loving me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
(She was wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(She was loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
(She was wanting me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

Why.. Ooh no
Alright
Ohh
(I’m in love, love)

[Verse 3]
I didn’t know she was already spoken for
‘Cause I’m not that kind of man
Swear that I would’ve never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I’m holding her to blame

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(Holding her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(Holding her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
(Holding her to blame)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(Holding her to blame)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can

She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone

She said just to give her a page

Tell em catch me if they can
I switch gears then switch lanes
You know just what my mind's on these days"
1139,Pretty HurtsBeyonce,"[Intro: Harvey Keitel & Beyoncé]
Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

[Verse 1]
Mama said, ""You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters""

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Verse 2]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge]
Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Outro]
When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)"

While I watch it like the cops, do the niggas in the hood
Smell it fore I light it so you know my weed good

Concealing big D, she gon take it like a crook

Word to my nigga double A, everybody's under me

Popping bottles in the club, everybody in the club straight sipping on my shit, pushing that Range, diamonds and the chains
Everybody came when I had shit but when the money get low everybody go talking that fly shit
But I can't knock how the game is, ain’t the first nigga that’s famous
I can’t change shit, but I’mma be okay
Cause man I’ve been out here, I’ve been grinding, I’m tired of these niggas, man, I’ve been too silent
My momma she told me “You claim it, you got it” and I’m like okay
I’mma do it for my city, I’mma be on top, okay

Faded at the fashion show, tryna grab a bitch off the runway
I ain't even pack no clothes, nothin' but rubbers in my suitcase
Laid her on the mic, menage with my model and her roommate

1153,Guts Over FearEminem,"[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
""Do I really belong in this game?"", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You,” ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear"
1154,Till It's GoneYelaWolf,"[Verse 1]
I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now
I’m not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load
I'm not the road that you take when you're lookin' for a shortcut, uh
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch
I ain't the money man, with your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
I ain't the dishrag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for 'em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, but what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

[Verse 2]
I'm not the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Not the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
'Cause I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That you scheming to check out
Unless you're looking to check out [shot, shot, shot]
What a mess now (c'mon)

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

[Verse 3]
I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and tellin' me I changed
Damn right I fuckin' changed
When this fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say ""I'm a fan""
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone"

If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it

All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that you're the only reason for it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face and it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted 'cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it

Ooh you can get it, I never felt like that before
Ooh, you the realest, yeah, I admit it
All in my feelings

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Had to pause, nigga, wait a minute
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin'
A little cocky, I can deal with that
'Cause you put it down and I need parts of that
Just text your phone, nigga, ""Where you at?""
Give me rounds, I need all of that
Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked
So is you tryna take it down or nah? Or nah?

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
In the club twisted, ooh, reminiscing
Boy, I can vision round two
It's me and you and I'm winning, it's no competition
Boy, you about to, uhh

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Had to pause, nigga, wait a minute
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin'
A little cocky, I can deal with that
'Cause you put it down and I need parts of that
Just text your phone, nigga, ""Where you at?""
Give me rounds, I need all of that
Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked

Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on

Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Who she seeing? Who she fucking on the low?
She kissing him, she kissing her, she one of those
Fuck is you? You TMZ, you Sandra Rose
That's little sis, I'm big bro, so let's go
Maybe it's the way I speak it
Know the spot, and how to reach it
When I meet your man, shake his hand
That's I'll keep our little secret
Woo, no pillow talk, no kiss and tell
They countin' coins, my pockets deeper than a wishing well
She like ballers, she like Birkin buyers
She got a wild side, she like dope boys with a certain fire
That's me, nigga, so that's me, nigga
No if, ands, no maybes, so that's oui nigga

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now
Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""

Second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker

I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's 50 dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope

She's living in a world, and it's on fire

Okay now do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket
Broke niggas looking mad, they just gotta deal with it
Get right ho, roll a dice ho
And you ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoes

Everyday I do my thang, big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacaine
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs
I like my women fat ass, pretty toes and thangs
Long hair don't care long as none down there

I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you

I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

Do to you

I might have to take your number when I'm through with you

EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
Yah! T.R.U., 2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die, whattup?

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true? That’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food, she got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out and I say, ""Damn, that makes two of us""
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word

You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some, I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass, take him out
Bring 'em in, them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t, went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!)
YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie

I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe

Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
""Was she attractive? Was she an actress?""
Baby, the fact is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(So baby)
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful

Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

So please don't judge me (Don't judge me)
And I won't judge you (And I won't 'cause)

So please don't judge me and I won't judge you (No, I won't)
And if you love me (If you love me), then let it be beautiful, babe

1190,Diced PineapplesRick Ross,"[Intro: Wale]
Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you what's better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers
Shorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'til you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If it's not it baby, hope it's progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby
No more talking baby

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh (ugh)
Sex all night, couple shots of CÎROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing, baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG, them other niggas fell off
Baby girl, I just wanna see you well off

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, Thug Passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera, baby girl lets take a trip
I'ma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission, hopefully you'll learn a lesson (ugh)
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment

Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 3: Wale]
Something about her, probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you? (sweet is you?) Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying to eat, and we don’t need a spoon

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah"

Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, ""Boy, won't you get your rest on?""
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

It’s just me and my niggas
And my family
And people that care about me and my fans
Fuck all these other niggas

[Chorus]
I can’t decide
What if life’s a lie?
I push the lames aside
They’ll learn
I can never front, know why?
It’s not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they’ll burn
I can’t decide
What if life’s a lie?
I push the lames aside
They’ll learn
I can never front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
They’ll never take me alive
King Wizard!

[Verse 1]
You love that little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggas know the uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, don't know a damn thing about him
What is hip hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know
Go, all day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight
Yup now fuck you I ain't left
I'm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ain't missed one step (yet, yup)

[Chorus]
I can’t decide
What if life’s a lie?

Its not my style, no lie
They’ll never take me alive
King Wizard!

[Verse 2]
My head hurt, gotta give me something that'll make me feel good
I remember couldn't tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would
Niggas ain't working, like me I had to put my bid in
All this rose gold I'm dipped in
Juste un clou, while I coast through clouds
That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally gonna be my world
Here all the girls can be my girls
Just sit back count stacks girl
Hold a nigga down all the time girl

[Chorus]
I can’t decide
What if life’s a lie?
I push the lames aside
They’ll learn
I can never front, know why?
It’s not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they’ll burn
I can’t decide
What if life’s a lie?
I push the lames aside
They’ll learn
I can never front, know why?

When we were together, I held you down
I gave you all of me, but look at us now
Thinking of all your excuses, but they don't add up
Now it's so easy to see you don't deserve my love

You pushed me far...you brought me to this
You had my heart...but then you blew it
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are?

[Hook]
Trust and believe me, you're gonna need me
Trust and believe me, she'll never be me
And I'm so over you
Go get lost
Boy I don't know Who do you think that you are?

[Verse 2]
You look so foolish
With my best friend
And she ain't no better than you
She's a 3, I'm a ten
So why are you calling my phone
You ain't got nothing I want
Thought we were really in love
But that was all a front

You pushed me far...you brought me to it
You had my heart...but then you blew it
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are

1201,My Life50 Cent,"[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My, yeah, yeah, mmm
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem & 50 Cent]
While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin' shed, sharpenin' my machete
Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, gettin' my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-get-even?
I think you fuckin' meatballs keep on just forgettin'
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginnin'
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offendin'! (Yeah!)
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin' up!
You’re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinkin' about just sayin', ""Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!""
‘Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul in this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch) and I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
‘Cause I'm runnin' in circles with—

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe, maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy, now pick the casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic, it's sad
It's never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"

The wound heals but it never does
That’s cause you're at war with love
You're at war with love, yeah

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's ruin me
Arrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding on another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
(Go!) With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

[Pre-Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
'Cause I’m the only one that's tryna keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming ""medic""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

[Pre-Chorus 2: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much
'Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco]
'Cause you've set me on fire
I’ve never felt so alive, yeah
No, hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love
And I’m at the point of breaking
And it’s impossible to shake it

[Pre-Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
Hope it heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love!

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
I ain't ever gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
I ain't ever gonna change
These battle"

1210,Same LoveMacklemore,"[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient

Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)

1213,Can't Hold UsMacklemore,"[Intro: Macklemore]
Hey, hey, hey
Good to see you
Come on, dude, let's go
Yeah! Let's go!
Ha-ha-ha-ha alright
Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back (back) pack (pack), fat (fat) cat (cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Interlude]
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Bridge: Ray Dalton and Macklemore]
Na na na na, na na na na (Huh-uh)
Hey (And all my people sing)
Na na na na, na na na na (Hey, hey, that's right)
Hey (Here we go, all right, uh)
And all my people sing
Na na na na, na na na na (You do it, Ray)
Oh (Ha-ha, let's go)
And all my people sing
Na na na na, na na na na
Mack-le-e-e-e-e-more!

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment (Ooh)
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over (Ooh)
So we put our hands up (Ooh)
Like the ceiling can't hold us (Ooh)
Like the ceiling can't hold us (Ooh)

1214,Brand New MeAlicia Keys,"[Verse 1]
It’s been awhile, I’m not who I was before
You look surprised, your words don’t burn me anymore
Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it’s clear to see
Don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of me
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free

[Verse 2]
Careful with your ego, he’s the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back, God knew something had to change
I thought that you’d be happy
I found the one thing I need
Why you mad? It’s just the brand new kind of me

[Chorus]
It took a long, long time to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised

[Verse 3]
If I talk a little louder, if I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller, I been under you too long
If you notice that I'm different, don't take it personally
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new kind of me
And it ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of free

[Chorus]
It took a long, long road to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, see you look surprised

[Bridge]
If you were a friend, you wanna get to know me again
If your were worth a while, you'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry, I'm too busy finding myself
I've got this, I've found me, I've found me

[Verse 4]
I don’t need your opinion, I’m not waiting for your okay
I’ll never be perfect, but at least now I’m brave
Now my heart is open, and I can finally breathe
Don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of free
That ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me"

Working in the pot, I can make you do aerobics

She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, ""'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody""
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, ""I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud""
I said, ""Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound""

1222,Long Live A$APA$AP Rocky,"[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians (Uh)
The land of no religion (Uh)
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

[Chorus]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever

Or toting on that semi, rob a motherfucker blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind?
Niggas talking down
Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom (Uh)
Cause there's killers in my town (Uh)
Making hits, sniffing lines (Yeah)

Wait for shit to simmer down (Uh)
Corrupted little minds (Yeah)

Got me up all night

She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

1234,She Don't Put It DownJoe Budden,"[Intro: Joe Budden]
She ain’t got a leg to stand on
Don’t even trip

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I can take you all over the world though
Even tell you pack light
The last slide couldn’t even get a cab ride
She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned
With other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, since mine's hers
That shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no, she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick
Uh, and I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made-up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why? It ain’t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear
How could other women compare? They can’t

[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I can see the stars in the day time
Bitch, I miss you, like a deadline
And the girl I’m with is just the girl I’m with
I mean it’s working out, so we’re staying fit
But you know love is nothing; ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch, like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy; crash test
You be fuckin' that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga! He can’t fuck with me
I’m Tunechi, bitch, and you know that
And that pussy throw back
But any given night, I’d still pop that ass, like a Prozac
Girl, you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me, and I know you still for me
That’s why we still fuckin'
‘Cause she don’t put it down like you

[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Love being around mine, no downtime
Still nothing else even matters
Can’t even walk slow through that mall
‘Cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off
Like I’m sleeping with the clapper
Say she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How I’m sexing her
Makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know, you done turn them all to Casper
Climb with the former rather latter
You already know which one I’d rather cum on

[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you"
1235,BadWale,"[Intro: Wale]
Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm startin' to think it ain't for er'ybody
Most of us is rushin' into it anyways
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
(Let's get it!)

[Verse 1: Wale]
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad, nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya
But to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it

I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya

That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
(Yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)

[Verse 2: Wale]
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose
(Bad, nooo) In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn!

No, I never did it

You won’t find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out ’til three
You won’t ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
You won’t find him tryna change the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Chorus]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

When the money’s spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know that there’s no need for me to panic
'Cause I’ll find him, I’ll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need’s a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

[Chorus]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we’ve spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

I, I can't really explain what is is she does
But um, yeah, whatever it is, it's um
Whatever it is, it's simply amazing

[Verse 1]
Her head is on my chest, the sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face
Beautiful in every way, you are

[Pre-Chorus]
See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
And how we play fight up in the bathroom
Next thing you know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

[Chorus]
She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me and it's simply amazing
Amazing, mazing

[Verse 2]
The girl's a work of art and I can't help but stare
With the smile like the sunset and an ocean as her hair
Ooh, what she do ain't fair
Ooh and she know me better than I know myself

[Pre-Chorus]
See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'd be damned, if I don't believe in us
Like when I said ""I love you"" for the first time
And the tears dropped from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change, no

[Chorus]
She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me

[Bridge]
There is nothing in this world
That can keep me away from you
And there's nobody
Who could ever compare to you, oh

[Chorus]
She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me and it's simply amazing"
1238,Wing$Macklemore,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside, and I was like ""Momma
This air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly""
I hit that court, and when I jumped
I jumped, I swear I got so high
""I touched the net! Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life""
Air Maxes were next, that air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the thread, at school
I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros, yo
Stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos's brother got murdered for his Fours
Whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro, those were not tight
I was tryna fly, without leaving the ground
'Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right, wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em
So exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes, I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me ""Be a consumer""
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
""Are you stupid? Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!""
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine off

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Outro: Macklemore]
They started out with what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes"

Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason

How we still fuck the same hoes
Why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch
I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes

That price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame
Then hang it dry like clothesline

Uh, my nicotine, my blue dream, my hydroponic candy jelly bean
Did you fix me up, I'm your number one fiend
Be my little pill and just creep into my bloodstream
Bloodshot eyes, I'm hopped up on it
You ain't gotta think twice, just hop up on it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
Uh, that pusher love, that's what I call it (Pusher love)
I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love

All this ice I'm just livin' the life
Bad bitches want me, give me head like lice
Hit club LIV in a rush
Pockets so swole I think they finna bust
Ace in my hand and a 45 tuck
Money coming down codeine pourin' up
Smokin on some dope, always on a float
20 years in niggas callin me the G.O.A.T
Money adding up you haters going broke
Still in the game while you niggas ridin' oak
See me showin' out they muggin' I don't give a fuck

Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

[Verse 1: Future]
Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a 'Vette
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga, get back
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whip a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50 thousand on yo watch, young nigga, splurge
Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin', gotta buss a cape
I'ma take a phone call, hustle every day

Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a Spyder
Young nigga play with keys like a typewriter

I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a four-door Bimmer, driving with a rifle
Nigga, where you at? nigga, we gon' pull up on ya
Young bitch looking like Janet in the '80s
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a Jheri curl
Got a styrofoam cup and it's full of syrup
Send it over from Lil' Mexico and let me work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

[Chorus: Future]

Pop a lot of pain pills
'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Yeah
Beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Yeah
Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
That's your ho callin' from two different phones
Tell that bitch, ""Leave me the fuck alone!""
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop a ollie and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
'Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man, I just received a package
Them other niggas taxin'
And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home, man, that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate

[Chorus: Future]
Ayy
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in a new 'Rari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate

1251,Strawberry BubblegumJustin Timberlake,"[Intro]
Hey pretty lady
This goes out to you (This goes out to you, you, you)
I said it like a thousand times
But everyday still feels like the first day
(This goes out to you, you, you)
This is dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Pretty lady, when you walk on by
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, sunshine
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow

[Verse 1]
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it’s pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

[Verse 2]
So tell me why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
'Cause you don’t wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

[Post-Chorus]
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
She's my little strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
Hey, hey, hey

[Bridge]
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I'll make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl if you’d be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop

[Melody Change]

[Verse 3]
Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want. Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers, it's so sweet
That's what you told me when I touched on your lips
Towel under the door, girl, before they pick up your scent ah
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
Then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
(Little girl, would you be my)
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
Hey, hey, hey
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop

1255,Blue Ocean FloorJustin Timberlake,"[Verse 1]
Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Verse 2]
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Bridge]
20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor"

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through

Alright, uh
She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me ""make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lying
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

1265,I Hit It FirstRay J,"[Chorus: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

[Verse 1: Ray J]
I had her head going north and her ass going south
But now baby chose to go West
We deep in the building she know that I kill 'em
I know that I hit it the best
Candles lit with that wine, money still on my mind
And I gave her that really bomb sex
No matter where she goes or who she knows
She still belongs in my bed
Going hard in the streets, mobbin with my homies
Sippin' on good, blowin' on OG
Me and ghost sittin' clean with the matching rollie
I did that first so everybody know me

[Chorus: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Steady on at the top where we finna be
Apple juice and we mix it with the Hennessy
Give her no dough to come, but I gave her 10 to leave
I bet I hit it first, unless you took that girl virginity
First come, first served is all a player know
But I don't wanna be a player no more
That's a lie, I'm way too fly
I love anything with ass that walk by
Yeah you love her, yeah you hug her and you kiss her
She dome me up, she give me face like some whiskers
Tia’s and Tamera’s, I be knockin sisters
And I still hit, while you lonely and you miss her

[Bridge: Ray J]
When I walk in the function
You already know I'm leaving with something
Girls know when I'm coming
I give a girl real proper loving

[Chorus: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

[Verse 3: Ray J]
And if you were to come back to me
Girl, I know just how you'd do me
And if you were to come back to me
Girl, I know just why you'd choose me
And if you were to come back to me
Girl, I'll get it wet -- jacuzzi
And if you were to come back to me girl
We'll make another movie

[Chorus: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

1267,Lose To WinFantasia,"[Verse 1]
Ever felt so ugly, pretending that he loves me
Sometimes it’s just not money, never had to afford me
Now I’m sick and tired of you just taking right off
Knowing I'd forgive you
You ain’t here for dinner
Like I’m a beginner
I loved you for your inner, inner, inner
And the next guy is out there somewhere
But you won't dare cause you’re too scared

[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he ain’t willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
And all you do is fight
Can’t get no sleep at night
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again

[Verse 2]
Ever felt this sorry? All you did was worry
You didn’t want nobody, thought it would get better
But it’s falling more than
Oh it’s falling more than ever
I just hoped that we would
Cause you’re always up to no good
Maybe it’ll take someone else to show me better
But I don’t wanna leave ya

[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he ain’t willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
And all you do is fight
Can’t get no sleep at night
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again

[Bridge]
Some of you know what it feels like
Caught up just in his life
Don’t wanna try again, thinking what’s the difference?
Why am I not interested?
Cause when you’ve been broken, you feel like no one can fix it
Yeah

[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he ain’t willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
And all you do is fight
Can’t get no sleep at night
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again"

So, I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it
I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

[Verse 1: Kristo]
I’m like “Girl whatcha doin for today?”
Im thinking maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I don’t believe in love at first sight
But after seein’ you baby maybe I might
'Cause when you walked by. I knew you we’re my type
The apple of my eye. You’re flyer than a kite
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny
But (but) I’m just warmin’ up
Look at you, look at you, all dolled up
Look at me, Look at me, gettin’ caught up
Goin’ down, goin’ down, yeah I’m shot up
But hopefully, you got a number I can call up
And if you do girl, that be super
These chicks hot, but you’re so much cooler
And I was hoping she would give me a chance
She walked by and didn’t gimme a glance. Damn

So, I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’

I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

[Verse 2: A-Wolf]
Yeah, yeah, I said “Girl whatcha doin’ on the weekend”
And she said “I don’t even know depends”
But you’re the one that I’ve been seein’ in my dreams and
Maybe we can get together in the evening
I know we just met but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, I’ll put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, I’ll be in the deep end
Ha, your beauty got me sinkin’
Got me sayin’ “all this shit” without thinkin’
I probably sound like I spent the night drinking
Or these are lines that I’m always repeatin’
But it’s the heart on my sleeve
That wanna know if your might have a spare key
But if you’re a heartbreaker then please spare me
Damn, she was apparently

So, I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’

Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

In this light, you’re lookin’ like you’re inflight
Pretty voice, put a ribbon on you’re wind pipe

1270,GangstaKat Dahlia,"[Chorus]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 1]
Yeah I’m young, 21, living in a crazy world
But I know the difference between a man and a herb
You frontin’ like you got it, claim they hatin’ on your wallet
Gucci telling you the time and you watch it
No I ain't stunting like my daddy, he’s livin’ with my granny
Used to be a big baller, he's surviving off of gambling
But I love him he’s my daddy, yeah I love him he’s my daddy
Put him in a big house before I ever see a Grammy
And my mommy started working days at the church
Finding faith in God cause the real world hurts, so much evil lurks
They just make us work but we can’t find work
Abuela, mommy and the girls in a one bedroom
South beach lifestyle, they just paying for the view
Mommy on the couch since she was 42
Sacrificing for the kids cause that’s what mommies do
So I smoke my spliff, I spliff it hard
Candi says to stop, my voice is getting too harsh
So I sobered up and my thoughts they rush
And now I think of you behind bars
Cross state lines, they spliffing good
In Miami you catch a charge and the whole family tears apart

[Chorus]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 2]
And this recession so depressing
My parents don’t stop stressing
Just hoping I learned all their lessons
Mmm and I’m paying for this session, I’m paying for this session
And I’m paying rent, food, clothes, phones, christmas presents
Six shots in, I’m just counting all my blessings
No days off baby, I ain’t resting
I told my sins, now I'm done confessing

[Chorus]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 3]
One way to the top, I'll make with what I got
You want my number, baby, I’m on a mission, catch up
Men selling love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves he’ll start flirting with me
So I took my heart off my sleeve
Never trust a man cause they all hungry
Yeah, they all hungry
Never trust a man cause they all hungry

[Bridge]
Right when you thought you had me
Baby, you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby, time to move on
Never learned your lesson
Ain’t even gon' question
Why it went so wrong
Right when you thought you had me
Baby, you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby, time to move on
Never learned your lesson
Ain’t even gon' question
Why it went so wrong

You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you done"

Take me to the King

My heart is torn in pieces
It's my offering
Take me to the King

Truth is I'm tired
Options are few
I'm trying to pray
But where are you?
I'm all churched out
Hurt and abused

No strength to fight
No tears to cry
Even if I tried
But still my soul
Refuses to die
One touch will change my life

Take me to the King

Power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor
So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
Everyday the day date, gangbang major pain
D-Town I ride around me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's
On a day to day base, then vacay for eight days
You know muthafuck taking a vacation
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation
Full glass of champagne, Oh no, you can't taste it

I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer

Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom
Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down
Southside my eyes down, I'm the shit y'all fly around(Oww)
I’m in my mode today, sayin what the fuck I’m ‘posed to say
Moving making money, got them trashbags back
Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweet and I'll eat her
Got strippers and divas, plus some cougars and cheetahs
Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Bonita
I said ease up, ease up, ease up
Ain’t nobody fucking with my clique

And all these bad bitches man, they want the.. (dick).. (they do)

[Verse 3 : Big Sean]
All I care bouts my crew, my family and women
Except these women that’s hoing, and these hoes that be stealing
Trying to get them a cut, that’s how you end up with stitches
I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position
Either move or get devoured, fuck a coward
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I dont
Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash,
Smile for the polaroid, self-employed
Now you shelf employed, D-Boy
Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy
And I'm with the same crew til I'm an old man
Cause there no such thing as new old friends

[Chorus]
I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched

Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill

My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves

They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh

Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

It's Young Khalifa, man
2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin' paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob, all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now

This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

1284,Crooked SmileJ. Cole,"[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down

Love you then they hate you
Then they love you again
Hate you then they love you
Then they hate you again

[Hook: Sam Dew]
(Keep giving me love) hold me tight, (and then you take it away) let me go
(Keep giving me love) heal my heart, (and then you take it away) hurt my soul
(Keep giving me love)
[They’ll never ever, ever know your soul]
Build me up, (and then you take it away)
[Never know your heart] break me down
(Keep giving me love) Make me smile, (and then you take it away) make me frown
(Keep giving me love)
[Ain’t no love in the heart of the city, that’s what they told me]
Give me love, (take it away)
[I’m just waiting on somebody to show me] take it all away again
(Keep giving me love) Give me love, (and then you take it away) take it all away again
[Just waiting on somebody to show me]

[Verse 1: Wale]
Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me
Beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me
Son of a mother studying at UDC
Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
On everything I wear it, all the America's tees
This whole system most prolific in the DMV
Listen when you get the keys it's seldom, you don’t get the beef
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance
From the city that made me love you forever for it
Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not
They gon' love you a little different when you at the top

[Bridge: Wale]
Give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby
What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby
This ain't right, this is life
This a love hate thing
Give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby
What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby
This ain't right, this is life
This a love hate thing

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, my affinty grows as the city gets cold
As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own
But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor
I'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul
Women in town, but I'm manifestating every goal
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week
Media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet
I lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead
When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?
Lord father if I opted to follow them
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare
How could you blame us envy?
We do the same thing for a living
Know the same niggas, but they all commend me
Champagne I'ma spill it until we all fill up
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
And probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks
So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians

They didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money I'm hunting it down
Planting the seeds, working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money

Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat docked in front of Hermès picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven

Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean"

1306,BewareBig Sean,"[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying ""Fuck you,"" ""I miss you,"" or ""I hate you so much""
'Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say ""Be real,"" I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?

I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, ""Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?""
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with

Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""Ain't no woman like the one I got!""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

Nothin' for me to do but smoke up if it's a Friday
Break it down, spread it out, nigga, roll up!
And let's see what they about, call them hoes up
Ludacris, man these bitches want my last name
Sip slow but I'm drivin' all in the fast lane
Get the fuck up out my way, man, move bitch!

Been makin' money since before I was in the limelight
Grind right... Bitch what's uuup?
Top down, but I feel like gettin' fucked uuuu-u-u-u-up

A real nigga, what your woman wanna shake for
When you shake it for a baller, better shake it right

Club packed, and women gettin' they drink on
Just looking for a reason to get they freak on
Catch me up in the VIP and it's roped off (Why?)
TO keep raggedy ass hoes off
And I'm 'bout to have a smoke-off
Rich nigga, but I'm trying to get broke off
Turn it up as I make the beat break down
Ass up... FACE DOWN!
Yeah, that's still the best way to get it
Down the middle, that's the best way to split it
I'm talkin' money, Disturbing Tha Peace racked up
One too many American black cards stacked uuuu-u-u-up
Backed up and it's on
Don't get beat down to the song
I see these hatin' ass niggas wanna fight
Well it's about to be a hell of a night

I'm always looking for trouble to get into
Tell your girlfriend's friends, bring friends too
What you drinkin'? I got it, I pour it all up
Southside, my partners they throw it all up
I don't want a menage, so bitch, let go
I'm tryin'a get three women, play Connect 4
Congratulations, you made it into the Top 5
Your mouth helped me push the Bentley into Mach 5
She got me speedin' in the red zone
Or as Luda like to call it, it's the Head Zone
Heads up! A bread winner, the bread's up
So make a peace sign baby, put your legs up
Is it really that good to ya?
Do you like it when a nigga talk hood to ya?
Do you like a lil' scratch, lil' bite?
Well, it's about to be a hell of a night

She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city, still scream XO, when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean for the sake of my career
I'm not tryna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake dawg, this the shit you need God for
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person

See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin'
Do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stockin'
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress

Young nigga blowin' up; Kurt Cobain—boom!
Skatin' on them like I'm Lil Wayne
And this 458 don't do the lil' lane—vroom!
Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
'Cause I heard the feds got him and he had them birds on him
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll with him
Caught a case, what you think? Nigga fuckin' told on him
I ain't get my shit snatched yet
You ain't get your bitch back yet
One call, niggas aim that TEC
Blood drawn, headshot, nigga brains on step
Hot shit if you pop shit

Rollin' down Collins, call Rugs, hit the A with them
Compound niggas live now
If it's the finals I'm ballin' like I'm LeBron now
I call up Onyx and tell them bitches to calm down

And I don't fuck with no niggas
If they don't fuck with my niggas
And I ain't fuckin' no bitches, if they fuckin' my niggas

It ain't nothin' for me to ball on you
It ain't nothin' for me to spoil you
If I adore you, I'ma give you that theory
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I wanna be where the commas will be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then its dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
Cause it's levels to this shit, and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, baby

[Chorus: Future]
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Make that bad bitch my shorty, hit the club, throw forty
My hat bent like 'Uhh!', my chain drip like water
Car paint like tar, I'ma sex her harder
Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it
Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years
Checked it, look her, you ain't even know, big deal
On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light
That ho chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine
White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain
Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur

[Chorus: Future]
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy

1318,Too MuchDrake,"[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
(Don't do that..)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'"

I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?

Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell, I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend, be your nigga or a friend with perks
I'm just tryna work that huh, they just tryna work your nerves
I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine
I'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Verse 2: Wale]
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind
This is not no Sandra Bull, but you're Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight
Easy baby, you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right
With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name, it ain't important babe 'cause I'ma call you Mine

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Bridge: Miguel]
'Cause I don’t know you, you don’t know me
The clock keeps ticking baby what's it gonna be
I don’t know you, you don’t know me
Let me teach you all the sounds of love

[Outro: Miguel]
Ahhhh, ayyyyy, eeeeee, ahh ohh ooo
Baby this was for you, lotus"

Live line on ladder 49, she's sliding down the pole
And that should be the Headline, cuz thats something they know
Keep the opposition's vision obsolete therefore thats OVO
Triangulate my position from using spokeo

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay""
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: doorknob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day

Cole World, Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes

Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
(Oh, baby, I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
(Look at your body, baby)
Girl lemme get them ""ooh-ahhs""
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, another day, another dollar
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her
That's life, shit, aight, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call, you gon' be like, ""Boo, why we haven't skyped yet?""
And on Skype, bet you say, ""'Le, where my flight at?""
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer, my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul, just to buy some attention
I need something to hold, fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road, don't ask me no questions
Please, fear what you don't know, haha

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
(Oh, baby, I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
(Look at your body, baby)
Girl lemme get them ""ooh-ahhs""
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?

[Verse 2: Wale]
Don't remember how I met her, but I know I won't forget her
And If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see Heaven
She say she from Seattle, she 20 and some change
Before I get to T.I.A, I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane, Chi-town O'Hare
We spend some time and get some wine, have some milds from Harold's
I told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off at Dulles, I'm headed to some money
TSA be laughing, all them rubbers in your luggage
I know I'ma always leave 'em, but I swear I'll always love 'em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another
Wale, oww!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
(Oh, baby, I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
(Look at your body, baby)
Girl lemme get them ""ooh-ahhs""
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood
Air baggage claim, awaiting miss thang out of St. Louis
Know she shining bright, got on my Cartier
She my Billie Jean, we menage with Mary Jane
See we city hop, Vegas to LA
Brings a lot of joy, Bugatti boy, that's lane to lane
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs
Marc Jacob the makeup, she Givenchy consumer
Gianni Versaci connoisseur, a carnivore
Accountable for a half a million uncounted for, boy
Hahahah (M-M-Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
(Oh, baby, I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
(Look at your body, baby)
Girl lemme get them ""ooh-ahhs""
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?

1345,Mr. WrongMary J. Blige,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
Bad boys ain't no good
Good boys ain't no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one

Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)

Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on

My fam' is screaming at me don’t do it
""Don't do it, Mary!""

Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)

When he put that loving on me, I can’t think of nothing
That’ll make me walk out

I must be out my mind
For going so strong

Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""wine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will"

It’s a shame you ain’t wanted when you had it, hey
Gave my love and you took the shit for granted, hey
And it was me those nights that you didn’t come home
Crying to my momma, blowing up your phone
Just wait a little while, baby, you gon’ see
That this gon’ hurt you more than it hurt me

[Chorus]
One thing that I know for sure
Is you gon’ miss me when I go
And it’s gon’ hurt, babe
When you’re all alone

You never know what you have until it’s gone

You can never say I didn’t try, hey
Gave my all but I couldn’t make you fight, hey

I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)

[Verse 1]
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Every girl I gave my loving to was only a substitute
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Even though she's in my arms, this ain't where my heart belongs
Sex in the air, no loving here
Soon as I get through, I'm outta there
And it feels so bad, but it felt so good
Wishing I could care, girl, I never could
But then I fell into good love
Didn't let me touch the ground
Now I see it clear that your heart is there
And all these other women, they just can't compare, girl, I know

Feelings I thought that I would never have
Ooh, I'm so open and I got it bad
I got you now and I'ma make it last
She says my baby, she can't wait to have
Love in the air, never been so clear
So beautiful, bring your body here
Let me fall into good love

Let me take my time while we in this bed
You were made for me and I don't wanna share, girl, I know

They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost"

I can love you with my eyes closed
I see your heart through a blindfold
I ain't never ever met another better
So my baby ain't no way that I'ma let go
From the North to the South Pole
On the East or the West Coast
Every area code, all over the globe
Ain't no way on the planet you can go that I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

[Chorus]
'Cause I got days and days of love for you, boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough, no
'Cause I got so much love for you, boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8, 25/8

[Verse 2]
You ain't gotta worry about me, no
Ain't no questioning my loyalty
You've been there for me even when nobody
Cared enough to check and see if I was breathing
See, don't nobody really know me (know me)
You and me, we got history
So I give you a part for loving me, boy
Put your hand in my hand, I'll lead the way out

[Pre-Chorus]
From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

[Chorus]
'Cause I got days and days of love, for you, boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough, oh
'Cause I got so much love for you, boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody give me love, give me love like I need
See, I love the way you make me smile
When things ain't going right
You know how to hold me tight
And make the pain go away, oh yeah

Every day baby, every night baby (Every night)
On the weekday, on any day
On everyday, I'm alive baby
I'ma love you, help me sing it out
Every day baby, every night baby
On the weekday, on any day
On every day, I'm alive baby
I'ma love you, help me sing it out

[Outro]
Days and days and days of love, for you, boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
'Cause I got so much love for you boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8...

I need days and days, I need days and days of love
I need days and days, I need days and days of love"
1372,MagicFuture,"[Chorus]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

[Verse 1]
On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport
Fifty thousand dollars on superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick if you wanna put me on a flyer
Excuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me to Grady's
A young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'mma do a 180
For the haters I'mma go ahead and do it 360
Drinking on a Sprite got lean all in it
I'm a Astronaut nigga better trust my pimping

[Chorus]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

[Verse 2]
Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learned the Astronaut Kid, no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Just left Magic in the motherucking basement
Two bitches trailing in a Bimmer out of Germany
Gotta thing for me, they wanna sing for me
They like my energy, I'm an embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
You will re-appear and go outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walking when you walking
I used to be fly but now I'm hawking
I was an Earthling now im SciFi
Wallah, I stay high

And crawl out in that new Porsche"

Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a free throw
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego (I got a big ego)
It's too strong, you said the drive stick
Well, baby, just peel off
Lovin' how it lasts long, leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on, Halloween pussy (haha)

1379,ClimaxUsher,"[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 1]
I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 2]
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Bridge]
You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

[Chorus]
Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh

Empty out the tool they was fillin' it with hate
Living life fast, guess mine's on a speed boat
Smoking weed like it's legal

Call me pimp homicide, let her jump off
Feel the texture Rumble on Webster
Stand on my own not who I stand next ya

1384,SabotageWale,"[Intro: Wale]
I thought it was important to go right into the booth after the arguing
I think it's only right, hoarse and everything
Like fuck it though, what's up

[Verse 1: Wale]
Pessimism is all that she know
Cause every brother she go with always pick up and go
I been trying to show you somethin, got a different approach
Told her, ""Give me your heart; try to get you the globe""
Have the world baby girl, live it up, you deserve it
Every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves
We go together / break up
We go together / break up
Ain't this an insecure bitch, meanin we love to make up
When we good, we good shawty
We don't ever make love
But if I call you out your name, I bet your ready to ""uh!""
You say you ready, you ain't ready enough
Cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up
This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit

She's tryna fall back, cuz she say I'm all that
She only love me when I be ignoring
When I be doing throwin it on her, shorty brushing me off
I swear, I kinda feel like she's slightly bizarre
Sabotage all the time, have me Avatar'd
Blue ball, who fault? Mine, only cause I stick around
She leave before the sun up, leave you something to think about
Yea and this is something to think about
Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse
Ha, that make it hard to be faithful
Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more
Ten more depending on where Wale going
Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long
It’s weird shawty, your wares showing me dead wrong
You gon' miss a good thing, end up bitter alone
Shit ain’t better alone

Ay, oh, yeah
Cole world, ah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing, man?

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh

Hey, but you're perfect for me

Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me

Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We’ll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal
(For real)

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that

We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing, even here inside these walls
Breaking each others hearts and we don’t care 'cause we’re so

[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much

The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much

Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad

And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way

In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much

Got on all my ice, talking cash shit
Been balling all my life, Lamborghini's, fast whips
She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide
We run the streets, but on G5's, I'm talking fly
Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings
You with a big boy, so we do the big things
Had to valet park it, Chanel hoodie on
Looking like Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted
She on my wanted poster, Ciroc in my mimosa
I'm balling like LeBron, we shopping in Milan
The 458 Ferrari, I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic
She my new addiction, I swear, I'm through with chronic
Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl, we the hottest
Rocking the most ice, I said we the hottest

You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone

Temporary forever, levitate with a nigga
I can tease you til you hate me
But you hate them navel kisses
We can do like 8 positions
Hit it 'til your make up missin'
Baby girl my stroke official
And you know I paint that picture
Hoes on my line, most of ‘em 9′s
Couple of ‘em dimes, but all my hoes is hard to find
And I ain't always on the prowl
It's just my soda mixed with brown
Got me quite open for a while
So let me in or let me out
And I like my marijuana bright
And I like my window tinted out
Shout out them strippers who hustle
Get yours; you know what this about
I just might throw a big amount
Don’t know if I’m ‘posed to take you out
I just know I’m ‘posed to praise you up
Don’t mean I ain't ‘posed to take you down
Word up

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
E’rry time she fuck me she say, “Can I have some money?”
And I say, “Can I get a threesome?”
She say, “Boy, you funny”
But I be like for real, just pick up that phone
Call on one of your girls
When I’m on that pill and I pop that Perc
Girl, I put in that work
Long as she come to me first
It's 14 racks, what I put on that purse
Shit, that Birkin bag make the old dude mad
When I murk through passed in a dark blue jag
Say she like my style but I talk too fast
And I got that drive and she just might crash
Hold up
She say she fuckin' with me the long way
She gon’ ride this dick, I had a long day
Nigga, look at my bitch, you looking the wrong way
Something mean, look exactly just like the song say

Fuck her good, make her call me in the morning"
1408,Pray For MeAnthony Hamilton,"[Verse 1]
I was stupid, really stupid
Something told me deep inside better not do it
What a dummy, such a dummy
To let some mess I shouldn't have did take you from me
Girl, if I could take it back, it'd be so back
I'd be such an angel
You'd think that me and Jesus was cool
Like that, just like that
Everything between us be good

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know what I should have done
Should have walked away the moment that I saw her coming
But I blew it, really blew it
And lost the only girl I love

[Chorus]
Dear God if you're listening now
I need you do a thing for me
You see my baby, she done up and walked out
I need you bring her back to me
I know that I was wrong, I was guilty as sin
Probably not priority
But dear God if you're listening now
Down here, dying, begging, crying
Somebody need to pray for me

Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Dear God if you're listening
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm...

Thought I was something, really something
In the end, who knew I'd end up with nothing?
I was fronting, truly fronting
Girl, I really can't be mad, I had it coming
Guess if I was half the man I know I am
I would be so good that even Oprah be jealous of you
It's like that, yeah, like that
Everything between us be good

Girl, I know what I should have done
Should have walked away the moment that I saw her coming
But I blew it, really blew it
And lost the only girl I love

I made her call me boss when in the bedsheets
We both coming from the same place
All in her both coming at the same place
Still on my dope boy swag
Top down on my Cam'ron, Oh boy swag
Played the hand we were dealt from the beginning, baby
You the dealer, cut the deck, while we winning baby

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right? (Just can't get it right)

Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right (Just can't get it right)
No matter how hard we try

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
Can't we turn love around
We build it up to break it down
If you knew the way I feel
You would know that this love is real
But live in Heaven, go to hell then
Go right back, across the lesson
Tired of stressin', get the message
I can't live in this depression no more
Boy, you know I love you
But I just can't go on (no more) feeling like this no more

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right? Just can't get it right
Just can't get it right. Get it right
Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right (Just can't get it right)
No matter how hard we try

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige {Rick Ross}]
Back on my own again (Back on my own, back on my own)
I don't want this to end (I don't want it to end)

And i think it should be you

Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store

Something that you ain't accustom to
Don't collapse with the Huxtables
Hoes like hats they adjustable
This is for my ladies and my fellas getting gravy
But your body's marked up, like the train back in the 80s
I've been through the test

Since I murder raps, I should tatt a tear up on my face
Can't you hear this flow? It's evil
Can't be near us close to lethal
Y'all are weird
Yo I'm just here to spit 'bout piercings, clothes, and needles
Grab some cheer-up for the people
Rappers fear cause most are feeble
I don't have to smoke I rap the dope considered so illegal
To all my Gs up, can I just get a witness
If you're inked up, throw your feet up
Or you're stylin' in a Mitch-Ness
Ain't leaving out my females

For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up

[Pre-Chorus]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on you, babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

[Bridge]
I'm a take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe
The love that's in-between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last

[Hook]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

[Outro]
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me"

Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I don’t want ‘er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Carona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you’d like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don’t get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see ‘er ‘fore I do tell ‘er I wish that I’ve met ‘er

And I know, to keep ‘er, yeah you gotta get that pay

I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number, you know I can’t wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I’ve tried to go to sleep
And seen ‘er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send ‘er to me
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell ‘er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell ‘er, tell ‘er we goin past the moon

Fast money, (Maybach O)
Believe that, (We going to turn out the club)

Lame ass niggas in your ear all night
Ciroc got me loose, but your dress fitting tight
My Rolly says two, but the time is three
Even though my watch wrong, girl, the time so right
I ain't selling no dreams, I ain't telling no lies
That dress so cold, but that body on fire
Ain't the smartest in the world, but looking at you girl
I'd be a fool to let the chance go by
So I'm gone

[Pre-Hook: Omarion (& Notorious B.I.G.)]
(Ask you what your interests are, who you be with?)
To convince you, I'm the one you should leave with
(Things to make you smile, what, what numbers to dial)
Girl, I got a thing for you, but it ain't no secret
If this conversation leads us
To the bed room we gon' make love
Cause girl I want to please you
And girl I really need you, so...

[Hook: Omarion]
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about tonight, baby

Soon as he buys that wine, I just creep up from behind)

Look at them, ey-ey-eyes over here
Pop a few bottles like the first of the year
Stare so right, and the visual probably better
But I came over just to make things clear
No disrespect, girl, we both so grown
Just want you by my side when I say, ""So long""
Been paying attention, niggas steady missing
Turning you off, Let me turn you on
So I'm gone

Let's talk about all the good things that could happen if you leave with me
You could see 'em hating if you want to

Soon as he buys that wine, I just creep up from behind)

Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They said ""thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real""
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon' be our year, every year gon' be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In God We Trust
We believe in God, but do God believe in us?
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle, consider ‘em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting
Hunh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only things truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
God Forgives and I Don’t, pussy niggas on notice

These waters can get a little busy

Don't mind trekking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me
Shedding all your innocence

Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist

Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin' syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don't let 'em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin' for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon' win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon' get here; pyrex vison
Made more than I ever made with DTP this year

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Livin like there's one thing on my mind

Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Waitin' on my moment...
Just waiting on my moment; bad hoes I'm shonin
Time came and I owned it just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touched the rock I cracked the block, when I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off on you bitch niggas, RuPaul
Real nigga in my hood, who everybody gon' root for
Cause they see me come from that bottom where everybody get bodied
They told me get em, I got em, now I'm here nigga like yeah nigga
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis and M4's this year nigga
If I don't grind, I don't shine, if I don't shine, then I don't eat
Won't eat, then I'mma starve, if I'mma starve, I pull heat
On all y'all bitch ass niggas, all y'all rich ass niggas
Cause if I dont make no money nigga, I'm gon' take yo money nigga

Livin like there's one thing on my mind

I'm just what you made God — not many I trust
I'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, ""Ain't no music on"", she said, ""No, that weed is loud""
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all

Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made

I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

Girl, I wanna say...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

August 4th, we were chilling at the house
Said I'm done, I told you to get out
Didn't mean a word that I said
Cause I was hoping you would come back

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I tried and tried
And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
And I tried to fight and I cried to God
Oh please let it just work
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed, baby...

[Chorus]
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry (baby, I'm sorry)
And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this (baby I want it)

All you have to do is say that I'm sorry (baby, I'm sorry)

You wanna know if I was moving on without you
(I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you)
To tell the truth i've thinking bout you lately
(I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you)
Christmas day, you said you had a ring
But you changed your mind
Too caught up in the streets
Boy, your truth is hard to believe
Why are you really scared of me?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I tried and tried
And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
'Cause I put in mine and worked overtime
And you never put in your work
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
'Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed, baby...

[Chorus]
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby, I'm sorry (no, no)

1445,Ten Thousand HoursMacklemore,"[Verse 1]
I hope that God decides to talk through him
That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork, cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums
Let the snare knock the air right outta your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Amen, regardless I'ma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
'Bout damn time that I got out of my basement
'Bout damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours
I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell
David-Bowie-meets-Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

[Hook]
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today, all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'ma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him
Celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage, I'm actually working on leaving, see
I observed Escher
I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Haring
You see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great because they'd paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No Child Left Behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system
What you expect?
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in, and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

[Hook]
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me

[Verse 3]
Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it
No light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart, no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever, man what is up with you?
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth

[Bridge]
It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted a encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave
Part of the show, it all fades away
Lights go to black, band leaves the stage
You wanted a encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave

Before canned goods it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots then we send em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy Trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the girls, where the love at

He be like, ""It don't matter"", I be like, ""Me neither""

1448,Miss AmericaJ. Cole,"[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
""And so my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country!""
Excuse me

[Verse 1]
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

[Post-Chorus]
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Verse 2]
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'ma pass your classes, I'ma learn your craft
I'ma fuck your daughters, I'ma burn your flag

[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts

They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio"

Look what this girl done did to me
She done cut me off from a good, good love
She told me that those days were gone

Now I'm sitting here going half crazy
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too
And it ain't no way in hell

And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends

Maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done, we can't take it back

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl whose swallow is on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take

[Hook: Chrisette Michele]

Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100

But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -

[Verse 3: Drake]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

No need to elaborate, most of these ducks exaggerate
But I'ma get money, nigga, everyday stunting, nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me (go)
Bitch, I'm balling like I'm coming off of free throws
Just ahead of the game, no cheat codes
Lambo, Roscoe, no street code
And your booty got me lost like Nemo
Go, go, go, go, gon' and do your dance
And I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands, go!

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance
DJ, turn me up, ladies, this your jam (come on)
I'ma sip Moscato and you gon' lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (le'go)
Girl, drop it to the floor
I love the way your booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash (whoa, whoa, whoa, le'go)"

1460,No BSChris Brown,"[Verse 1]
Yo it’s been a minute since the pen ain’t been a prob
I remind em all suicide bombs, fly the plane 9/11 dog
Tell em build a mosque, tabernacle, a synagogue
I’mma send em bars like the scriptures were sent from God
That’s too biblical not to listen to
Metaphysical literal lyrics put an end to you
Fully focused to finish you fucks
How you fitting to use all the miniscule minister minute I diminish dudes
That mean minus y’all, get these niggas Tylenol
Cause all I’m giving niggas is headaches when the mic is on
It was hyping y’all, in the magazines, on the blogs
So I aimed the bars at the block that’s the streets involved
Nas, no BS, no Chris Brown, just my Boston squad
Unless the Knicks is at the TD Garden
But everything else is mash while we steam up the hash
I’m with V Knucks and Flash about to reup the cash motherfucker

[Hook]
With the pen we true veterans
With the pen we teach youth to use Heaven-sent spitting blue heroin
On the move pedalling, measure and move medicine
Penmanship, smooth elegant, true veterans

[Verse 2]
Partially own half the strips that you think is popping
California buzz word to Stockton
Then I headed back to Boston
Lyrically an arson, turn the temperature up
We stick to niggas flossing
Intelligent thugs, gateway we pedalling drugs
My ink spray metal ? with blood
Cross the bosses, MAC-10s spit with night forces
Word niggas will bang for them Vs and might force it
My BBM reports like CNN
Got bitches who wanna see my men
Not many artists who wanna see the pen
Torae, Brooklyn don the vets
My soldiers swarm on anything and everything if it’s drama
? approach and die
Official vets from the Bridge to the Stuy, no lie
In the lab Easy Rider inhale we what you feel
This is proof that hip hop’s still real motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My pen depicts victimization and niggas that’s hating
My triggers is shaking, no clique is escaping, I ship em to Satan
God type spitting the ancient like hieroglyphics
And paintings from pyramids that was scripted in basements
I spit heat for the immigrant Haitians
In prison it’s pacing living in cages working for minimum wages
Pages of hope ? resembling Asians
Making moves to the Caymans
With clear water and the view is amazing
Now I’m taking trips to Jamaica with bitches with paper
I know where I came from, that’s why my vision is greater
So why the fuck would I consider a hater?
I’m stacking grands, making movies with some stunts doing favours
Jackie Chan, Torae spitting crack with the fam
We matching them grams
You want fire? I’mma need the cash in advance
I rap for them fans from Bean to the Africa sands
Now tell me who the fuck can go in like Flash and his mans

You know
Sometimes you have to put yourself first
I'm doin' me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes as women, we give more than we should
To a man that just don't treat us good, no
Gave him my heart, my time, did all that I could
In the past to keep him here with me, yeah
But now I woke up, opened both my eyes up
Realized that I don't need any other
Man, if you can't love me equally
Then you don't need to be with me
Nothing more beautiful than knowing your worth
And finally, I know exactly what I deserve, oh

[Chorus]
Doin' me this time around
Doin' me, don't need you now
I rather be by myself
I won't let your drama hold me down
Doin' me this time around
Doin' me 'cause I've finally found
I'd rather be by myself
I'm doin' me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Won't spend another minute wasting my time
On a man, hey, that only tells me lies, no
Ain't saying no, no, no, no that I don't need love
But them games, I don't need that in my life, no
Doin' me this time around

But it ain't up to me to make you change, yeah
Life is too damn short to live unhappily
So I'm being selfish and putting myself in first place

Doin' me this time around
Doin' me, don't need you now
I rather be by myself
I won't let your drama hold me down

Can I, can I, save you from you?
Cause you know there's somethin' missin'
And the champagne that you been sippin'
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition, it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

And oh you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no I get it girl, I'm wit it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
Cause man it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall

When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real

[Verse 1]
She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl, she raised me

1471,Loving You No MoreDiddy - Dirty Money,"[Intro: Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Hook: Diddy]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try

[Pre-Hook: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself (No, woah)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more (No, no, baby)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me

[Pre-Hook: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money & Drake]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more  (I can't) (Diddy)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure

[Bridge: Dirty Money]
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (No, lovin' you no more)
I love you more than I love myself (No, no)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (No, woah)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more (Oh, no)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (Just wanna love you baby)
I love you more than I love myself (Just wanna love you baby)"

Damn
Damn
Heheheh
Ugh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

[Verse 2: Miguel]
I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

[Chorus: Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3: Miguel]
'Cause being your friend is killin' me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time
I wonder so often, regret gets exhaustin'

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

[Chorus: Miguel]
All I want is you, mmh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone
All I want is you, ooh-ooh, ooh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, baby
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Bridge: Miguel & J. Cole]
Cause they don’t smile, huh, or smell like you
And they don’t make me laugh, or even cook like you
And they don’t photograph, nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it (yeah) I can’t replace it (yeah)
That's why all I want is you now

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, ""I’m wrong"", you say, ""Come again?""
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I’m prayin', you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby, boomerang, 'rang, huh

[Chorus: Miguel]
That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Miguel]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Yeah, now that you're gone, gone, gone
I want you back"

Ooooooooo, yea
Oooooo ohh
Ohhhhh wait

Two years since you walked away from me
Since all of our scattered dreams
Were just thrown away
I'm finally gettin back to what I used to be
Share my pain with my family
Think I'm on my way

I can sleep at night
I don't reach for you when I wake up (no)
But it's taken some time (yea)
I can live my life
Without praying that we could make up
I'm movin on, I'm feeling strong inside

[Hook 1]
But sometimes I cry, babe
When I'm all alone
With this heart of mine (oooo)
Sometimes I cry, babe
Although you've been gone
For a long, long time
(ohhhhhh yea)

[Verse 2]
Heard you're moving in with someone new
I hope all your dreams come true
And you'll both be happy, yeah

Been long enough for me to take a look around
I've met a girl, we've been hangin out
She's been good for me

But when we're makin love
She don't take me there like you used to
And it hurts when I lie (when I lie baby)
Help me understand how to push you out
Forget you and let you go
Cuz Lord knows I've tried, yeah

[Hook 2]
But sometimes I cry, babe
Baby i been hurtin'
For a long, long time (yes, I have babe)
Sometimes I cry, babe

Until I can make it
There's a smile on my face, yeah
But I'm broken inside, yea

Sometimes I cry, babe
When I'm all alone, when I'm all alone
With this heart of mine
Sometimes i cry, babe
Although you been gone for a long long
A long long long
Long long long long long long time

Please come home and wipe the tears from my eyes (baby)

Nice
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it
I dead 'em all now, I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Ain't gon' stress you, but I'ma let you know
Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em
Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em
Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em
Girl you be killin' 'em, o-o-oh

[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta worry bout her, shorty straight
Been chasing her for 2 days, first 48
A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watching my cutiepie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louboutin shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone 4, face time
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle Patron
When them other hoes call I hand her the phone
And she hand em the tone

[Chorus]
You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it
I dead 'em all now, I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you

Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em

[Verse 2]
Yeah I know that's what they all says
She got a donkey with her, Juan Valdez
Keep it clean cut like bald heads
Been playin with that green long as Paul Pierce
So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick, execution

[Chorus]
You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it
I dead 'em all now, I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Ain't gon' stress you, but I'ma let you know
Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em

Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em

Congratulations

Camera in the mirror, BBM Pose
Still killin' 'em hoes
You still killin' 'em hoes
You still killin' 'em hoes

1477,Moment 4 LifeNicki Minaj,"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I fly with the stars, in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live, doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me, and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water, upon a vampire ('Pire)
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, - yes!
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, - yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ - me!
But I couldn't do it all alone - we!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we're done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just reminds me of
Everything they deprived me of (Kyuh!)
P-p-p-p-put ya drinks up!
It's a celebration, every time we link up
We done did everything, they can think of
Greatness, is what we on the brink of

Shout-out to the CEO, ""500 Degreez""
Shout-out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch the bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives, ah!

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Chorus: Harry Belafonte]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
(I'm goin' back in…)
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna"

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, what it is world? (Ayy) Yeah, it's me again (again)
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No running from the truth (nah), as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again (uh-uh)
Most of you now saying, ""Whatever, here we go again"" (what?)
Blogs, radio and television all going in (ayy, ayy, ayy)
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious (ha ha)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now (now) with me looking down (down)
Same clown that was Twitpicing at my wedding (ayy, what?)
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second (hold up)
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess that time must be invested for this to be manifested (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yes it's, hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light (woo)
The Bible say, ""Let he without sin cast the stone first"" (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first? (Huh)
Yeah, he go to work, never done no drugs up until the Fed
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead (damn)
Difference is my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia (what?)
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God ain't that what really matter? (Nope)
And matter fact, I'm wrong but after that
The good I done in yo' hood, should it over-shadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with, even if you're so legit

Called it love, we wrote it then I wiped out
Two ships just passin' in the night now
Offshore, lookin' for a lighthouse

Green pill, you said that it was painless
Down and out, drownin' in a sea of my anguish
Funny, you always said hope floats
Comprehended but I can't cope
So I...

Tryin' to find my way back, way back

And it carried both of us away
We were so much better
When we were together, baby
And I just can't let you slip away

Someone's gotta take the lead tonight, who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you while it comes to me
If you have something to say, you should say it right now

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore

Every now and then, I still get a flashback
Of the time I spent thinking you could be that one
Should I have just kept your love?
Yes, I understand, we did have some good times
On the other hand, got me crying all night
It was too much for my mind

So even though I left you, I can't forget you
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
Guess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
When we were together, you ain't treat me right
Damn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet)

I still have the box full of things you gave me
Start to throw it out, something always stops me, yeah
I'm not as over you as I say
Deep inside my heart, I made the right decision
But it's kinda hard
When your mind is thinking of, did I make a big mistake?

So even though I left you, I can't forget you
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
Guess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)

See, I don't understand
Like, somebody is gonna get hurt
Out of this situation and you just hope it's not you..
At times..
Part of me wants you, part of me don't, part of me is
Missing you, part of me is gone. Part of me is saying that
The love is still strong. Part of me is letting go

So even though I left you, I can't forget you
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
Guess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)

It's so sickenin', history you're witnessin'
I had a girl, she quit me, now I'm single, wanna get with me?
Sticky cannot stick to me, if you see your chick with Gucci
Think before confrontin' 'ruly, ain't my fault your lady choosin'
4:30, still blowin' purpy, O.A. Verdy rollin' dirty
Wardrobe clean, that's just detergent, got your girlfriend pickin' purses
Say she lonely, Gucci only one way to meet me in person
When she get me home my nigga told me that she love my verses

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Your girlfriend keep callin' me, I feel like she stalkin' me
You at home and she with me, so mornin' it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it, beatin' her down straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets, got your blanket at the laundromat
Way baby girl throw it back, old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane now hardly there, smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate, oral sex, she mastered that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet
One hour not finished yet, never been a minute man
Always been a business man, got her catchin' feelings, man
Got a man? Oh really, ma'am? Actin' like I give a damn
Used to like her, now I don't, got a real short attention span

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci, Trey Songz, put it on, my shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song, she got on my favorite thong
She so hot, too hot to touch, to feel it, too much for lames
Gucci Mane, I'm extra clean, so extra rubbers on my brain
Got your main thing screamin' Gucci, every Tuesday night we do it
Wish we could do it more often, but I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet, Barbie, Aston Martin, double-park it
Beat it like we got a problem, pop her 'til she call me papa
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down"

Ooh, take a chance and give me your love
Baby, only good love, baby, don't you be

1503,H*A*MKanye West Jay Z,"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop, niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon' do, Hov?
This the new crack, on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas telling me, ""You back!""
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life's a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way, nigga, you should fucking quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you, motherfucker, and I get it, haha
No paper, ho, but you can have some more of me
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?
Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga
Going H·A·M, nigga, me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, why I have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head's so good, damn, a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumping out the building, watch out below
A million out the door

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm about to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I played chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been moved
I swam waters with Great Whites
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been chewed
I hustled with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes? Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
Then maybe you could take a peek at these boos
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily
Like these rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like, ""Really: half a billi nigga, really?"" You got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady's money
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
With my nephew die, daddy's dead
Nigga took the price on my uncle's head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread
Bow down, brother, pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Comme des Garçons, fuck yo' fresh
Head shots, nigga, fuck your vest
Fuck the pigs, no pork on my fork
Peace, God, 'cause you know a nigga just went

[Hook: Jay-Z]
H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am

Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am

So sad to see you go so soon
I know that you ain't comin' back
In the beginnin' everything was cool
Toward the end of it all, it's all bad
I know I played my part in making it what it is
And I know that you did the same
I guess I'm up outta here
I'm movin' on again, I sure that you will understand
I played by the rules, You played by the game
I couldn't have stayed, It's easier to say
Cause I was by your side when you went through the pain
I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away

[Chorus]
And every minute you're gone, I missin' you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different, if you could here me baby
Now that you're so far away -ay -ay -ay

Tear stains on my pillow
Tryin' to forget ya
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Four day and countin', I've been layin' here
Starin' myself in the mirror all alone in my room
I can't feel this way again
Gotta think with my head
Cause my heart is what go me here
So hurt from what you done
More than enough reasons for me to move on
Cause I gave you my word, you put you're trust in me
Supposed to be the one
To give you what you need
I was by your side when we were meant to be
Guess it doesn't matter now that you're so

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If I had known Sunday morning, that you would be gone
I would've never come home
I wouldn't have answered my phone to hear the voice had a tone
I knew that something was wrong
The cop's the one who had told me that you were alone inside an empty room
Identified you as my baby
Oh my baby, so far away

Please come back I miss you baby

Will you ever need me

And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'

Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it

Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy

Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter

If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak

100 on my neck, I'll die for my respect
20-fucking-10, I'ma blow the whole check
In the club, flex, after party, flex
You know how we ball, all I know is ball
Every dollar in my pocket, I'ma spend it all
When a nigga die, they gon' say shawty raw

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party"
1512,I SmileKirk Franklin,"[Intro:]
I dedicate this song to recession
Depression and unemployment
This song's for you

[Verse 1:]
Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, but where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me?
Tell me it's alright
(I'll be honest with you)
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower
(When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)

[Chorus:]
I smile, even though I'm hurt, see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile
Smile
It's so hard to look up when you've been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile, so smile

(Now every day ain't gon' be perfect
But it still don't mean today don't have purpose
Come on)

[Verse 2:]
Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, tell me where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me?
Tell me it's alright
(The truth is)
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower

[Chorus:]
I smile
Even though I'm hurt, see, I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile
Smile
It's so hard to look up when you've been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile

[Bridge:]

Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
(Look in the mirror)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
(Always remember)
You look so much better when you smile

I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower

[Chorus:]
I smile
Even though I'm hurt, see, I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile

It's so hard to look up when you've been down

[Verse 1]
Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can–I can make you give it up, give it up
Until you say my name
Like a Jersey, Jersey shuttin' down the game
Be my head coach
So you can–you can
And never take me out
'Til you can taste the way
Do it again, and again 'til you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad

[Hook]
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat, sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
Sweat, sweat

[Verse 2]
Can you, can you get me up?
Like I'm late for my first class
So I can give it to you rough
Like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane
You know I got paper, babe
But—them dollar bills
Girl, I'll make it rain
Holiday Inn
Come and meet me on my 8th floor
Damn, it feels good but I feel bad for them maids, though
And I, and I–I–I apologize
But when I slip–I slip—I turn girls into slip n' slide

I just wanna make you sweat

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ooh

[Hook: Jeremih]
I think I love you
But don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (Doing your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you, no
I don't want to hurt you
Play with your mind
Have you running in circles, yeah
Don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It ain't even the puss' I got your mind
It's usually a one way thing but baby girl got mine
Perfection is the formula when me and her combine
Like candy to the corn and yeah you're finger-licking fine
In due time I'm sure that I can please you, squeeze you, weak knees you
Need you like you need me, and don't mislead you
Love's free but treat it wrong and pay the price
Get down on one knee, that bitch gon' leave with half your life
Man believe me, I ain't gon' feed you bad advice
Look it's easy, so don't forget to strap up tight
Ride, I'd be selfish if I kept you so (So)
I love you enough to let you go (Go)
Cause on the other hand I couldn't take it if I
Put all I got in you and someone got you naked
You work hard for money but it's harder when you make it
These chicks coming fast, here's your heart before I break it; take it

[Hook: Jeremih]
I think I love you
Don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (Doing your thing)

I don't want to hurt you
Play with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
What type of nigga would I be to hold you up?
You need someone to hold you down
And recognize your life's fucked up
I got to shake you out my system
'Cause with the fucking and kissing
And all your emotions mixed in puts me in a tough position
Baby, what am I supposed to do?
I can't control my actions when I'm close to you
We been away too long girl we're overdue
I guess the cake ain't enough you want to eat it too
See me and you have a magnet in between that keeps pulling me closer
I'm like an addict for your scream, your fully loaded toast
Automatic with the beam, the baddest on the coast
I got to have you like the green, your swag is more than most
I got a sex drive that won't allow me to lax
Bring on the next five, look how they grind on my lap
Booty, breast, thighs keep your boy relaxed in back
And you deserve way more than that, I'll just fall back

[Hook: Jeremih]
I think I love you
Don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (Doing your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you, no, no
I don't want to hurt you
Play with your mind (Play with your mind)
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)

[Outro: Jeremih]
I've been thinking a long time
And wishing you were just all mine
So maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve it, I don't deserve it
I've been thinking a long time
And wishing you were just all mine
So maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve it, I don't deserve it, no
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it"

Damn, I thought I had it all figured it out
Especially when it came to relationships and girls
But just when I least expected it
Love, rearranged my whole world

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Junior high, played 'em, high school, played 'em
College, well, you know, played 'em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade 'em
Now cupid’s aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalant can I be, with you here staring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever see
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it

(J. Cole, baby bro, speak)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not so fast, Cole got a whole lotta lotto cash
Life of a bachelor, light skinned rapper
Found a top model with a Tahoe ass
With a broad so bad, when she cross your path
You get her outta them jeans you be thinking about rings
Okay she done got your ass
Cupid done shot your ass
But I'm trying to be a G though
So yeah, I'm gonna holler, yeah I'm gonna call her
But I ain't got a leash though
Uh, I put a name on a lease though
Get an extra set of my keys for
I think I might wife it now
But life is foul and you don’t got a free throw
Uh, and so my next move gon' have to be my best move
Beside every king is a bad ass queen
So girl let's make this chess move

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
Now baby, baby
You doin' things with my heart ain't never felt, its so crazy
I agree to acknowledge love if you gonna let it change me
I was so mistaken
Your love like a Bentley coupe, took me out of a Mercedes
Now baby baby, for so long I miss somebody
My heart just couldn’t played with it
I went from not wanting a girlfriend to needing ya lady
I didn’t think I'd ever see
Me callin' to you, you voice before I go to sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sean Garrett]
I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin' while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and I’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’
(Don’t wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable)
I see us growing
(Don’t wanna miss out on a feeling I ain't never had before)
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you done done to me, I gotta let ’em know

[Hook]

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
I’d swore I’d never fall, but I fell
Run and tell all my old hoes
Erase my number, my photos
Uh, baby girl pardon me but
Don’t text, stop calling me
I ain't your nigga, don’t bother me
Fuck your Twitter, don’t follow me
My new girl too thorough
Believe it or not, man, she’s all I need
Thought I was a player, R.I.P
Down goes Frazier, call Ali
Let's hit the mall and its all on me
Cause girl you deserve it
If I take this chance and make these plans
I gotta know girl is you worth it? Perfect"

1526,Gone And Never Coming BackMelanie Fiona,"[Verse 1]
It's sad that memories never die
Just fill your head with why
Then you're caught living a lie again
It's sad that all he ever said
Was that he loved me to death
But then he's gone again
And I was wrong again

[Chorus]
'Cause you think it's easier
Easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying
'Cause I need you back
'Cause I'm slowly dying
'Cause I need you bad
But you're gone and never coming back
Gone and not coming back
He's never coming back

[Verse 2]
Shoulda known
The long kiss goodbye
Would bring sadness in my life
Wearing this disguise again
I wish that you would have said
Or lied to me instead
Like a bullet to my head
Like a fool I pretend
That it's on again
On again

[Chorus]
'Cause you think it's easier
Easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying
'Cause I need you back
And I'm slowly dying
'Cause I need you bad
But you're gone and never coming back
Gone and not coming back
He's never coming back

[Bridge]
Who ever said look on the brighter side
Has never been on mine
Who ever said that he'll get his
Never felt like this
Ain't no use in crying
When you're done like that
'Cause baby, baby you took something
That I can't buy back

[Outro]
And now you're gone and never coming back
Coming back
Ooh he's not coming back"

1529,JohnLil Wayne,"[Intro]
Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Fo’ fo’ bulldog: my motherfucking pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker ""fetch""
I’m fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I’ma starve her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don’t sleep, so Weezy can’t rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Lil Wayne]
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Big black nigga in a icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Count the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick 'em off they might be hot, swish!
I’m swimming in a yellow bitch in the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I’m the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected got killers off in Chicago

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Lil Wayne]
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Talk stupid, get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I’m Redd Foxx
Big B’s, Red Sox, I get money to kill time, dead clocks
You fucking with a nigga who won’t give a fuck
Empty the clip then roll the window up
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas Cinnabon
I’m in a red bitch, she said she finna cum
200 thou' on a chain, I don’t need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E, five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with ya looking ass nigga
You know the rules, kill them all and keep moving
If I died today it’d be a holiday

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I’m not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don’t make it come alive
Rip yo ass apart then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon' bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny mom her only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I’m Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for each and all of y’all
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It’s a cold World I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up

I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car, yeah"

Forever more
Forever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you
I shine when you shine and there's really no substitute
Forever more
Forever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you
I shine when you shine and there's really no substitute

[Verse 1: Anthony David]
Take a picture, I want you to remember
When I professed my love
Press the button, I hope it's still recording
Every word I'm saying to you
I'm telling you right now from this day on
Already weighed out the pros and cons
Tellin' ya, you're just the woman I want (I want)
I want (I want), I want (I want)
Making my plans just to be with you
It's you and me, babe, 'til the days are through
And I ain't ashamed, love, to say I do
I do (I do), hey, hey

Forever more
Forever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you

Forever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you
I shine when you shine and there's really no substitute

[Verse 2: Algebra]
Pick a tree to carve our names
Let the world know it's not a game
Lasts longer than a wedding ring
Generations tattooed with the love we bring
From the seeds we sow
To the time it takes to grow
Long enough to show you
I won't let go of you
'Cause without you I'm incomplete
Like this love song without this beat
I'm saying that you are the man I need (I need)
I need (I need), I need (yeah-heey)
I'm making my plans just to be with you
It's you and me, babe, 'til the days are through
And I ain't ashamed, love, to say I do (I do)

Forever more
Forever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you
I shine when you shine and there's really no substitute
Forever more

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Uh, yeah, it's Phontigga, yo
Take a picture off the wall, try to reframe it
Take all the color off, try to repaint it
If you want picture perfect, well, we ain't it
Because we painted our own portrait
Of me and you that could never be tainted
Because real love embodies all colors of the spectrum
Mix a few greens with your reds and your blues
Create some new hues, then you rehang it
Start over, even though your friends gon' doubt you
And all them other niggas tryna scout you
It gets so tiring, but I'd be lying
If I said that I'd be better off without you
And when I think of walking out you
Smile in a way that make me feel like I'd be lost without you
Me and you are the only threats to us
'Til death do us, I'm standing next to ya

[Chorus: Anthony David and Algebra]
Forever more
Forever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you
I shine when you shine and there's really no substitute
Forever more
Forever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you
I shine when you shine and there's really no substitute
Forever more"

Looking for someone to love me
I’m-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

[Verse 1: Mary J Blige]
I’m no angel, there's so much I can take
Calm down, patience, don’t lose your temper, hold on, wait
I’ve got issues just like you, sometimes I get so confused
I’m strong but I can break, I be prayin so hard to get thru the day
Bad thoughts in my mind I can’t shake
Having nightmares in the day can you relate?
Please somebody calmly wake me
I can’t let this cold world take me, I was looking

[Verse 2: Diddy]
My drama, my karma
My love, my life, dear momma
The war’s I’ve fought, scars that I’ve garnered
The hustle, I got that honest from my father
Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can’t face defeat (nope)
I did it all in a week
Still incomplete as I stand on my feet
It take a lot to still dance to the beat
Skin more cold and callous than concrete
I love swimming but there's just one ski
In a rich man’s chique hotel with bed sheets
Uh ah, you know what I’m looking for

[Hook:]
Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me

Niggas can’t fuck with me, Virgin Mary
Go ahead make my day, dirty Harry
Weezy, fuck the world, pop the cherry
Everybody pushing but I don’t fall back
And everybody looking but blind to the fact
The clock on the wall say it’s time for some action
Now you can take that to the bank and cash in
I’m feeling myself, fuck if they feeling me
Can’t spell them without me, it's them or me
Yesterday was a memory
Looking in the mirror at my enemy
But today I’m...

Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

[Verse 4: Mary J Blige]
My rise, my falls, enemies wanna see me crawl
My ups, my downs, y'all know I’ve been around
But sometimes it bothers me when I hear people say a non truth
Am I sane, am I crazy, pick one there all the same
In this world we’re living in, I’ma make mistakes, I’m only human
I was...

Don't that shit there make you mad?
They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats
Then get busy on they ass
See, that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold
Don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go in and put your hands up
When times is hard you stand up

So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up

Four for the kids that don't wanna be there

Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back, that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys
I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti, then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy

So, no matter what you been through
No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin' on

I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing makes me wanna cry

Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when I pulled out that gun

When she fits right down in my shoes
Whatchu expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, aye-uh

Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body

1547,NovacaneFrank Ocean,"[Verse 1]
I think I started something, I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said ""don't let the high go to waste""
But can you taste a little taste

[Hook]
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, and pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway? (Ahh)
She said, ""Don't let the high go to waste"" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste of

[Hook]
Novacane, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novacane, baby, I want you

Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty, pity pity
I can't feel a thing, can't feel, can't feel a thing
Can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
Can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
Can't, can't feel her, feel her, feel her

Drinkin' out the bottle, smilin' in all my pictures
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like Twitter
Nigga you know everything Taylor
Don’t rush to the bar, fool, if you ain't got no paper, that’s the rules
High as fuck, sloppy drunk when I’m passin' through
Rollin’ doobies up, your ho who we pass ‘em to

Roll the camera, life just like a movie, I’m the star
Wish you was in my position, you too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women
With me in the back, sippin' Rosé with some hash twistin’
All about a dollar, my team into cash gettin’
Straight outta the 'Burgh where we drink and we smash niggas
So when I say I’m balling, that don’t mean that I’m playing, mayne

Tinted Escalade with a made man in it (hah!)
Rose gold shades with the Rozay lenses
Pink champagne and the flow's so endless (huh!)

Keep her close to me like lyrics, she spoke to me
In the middle of the winter, summer let her close to me

And these lights are glowing, but he don't want none
He'd rather chill at home, maybe he can be the one

My money tall, we could never be on common ground
Peel the top back, gettin' higher than the higher power (ahh)
Makin' love in the penthouse then it's sayonara (ah)
Fell in love with shorty blame it on the chemistry (ride)
Tools on the low, foes really envy me
Money multiplied S600 Benz

Monopoly shopping sprees, imagine what we can spend
Me and my shorty live, we'll do this shit again

I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious…

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say…

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
""Well, I'm sorry.""

Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Interlude: Drake]
You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

[Outro: Drake]
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, ""You niggas crazy""
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We gonna be in some trouble, trouble"

Told the one I love, ""I’ll be back one day""

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone

And yes I am the best man, I’m so sorry 'bout the mix-up

Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'll kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become near when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' their own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays

To conquer, to thrive

I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

[Verse 1: Future]
I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I'm comin' with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud, I'm laced up to the fuckin' fo'
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, droppin' all cash (Woah)
Gutter to the death of me, I'm stickin' to the recipe
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga, I'll split your tato
Ain't nothin' about me ordinary, I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss, it's gonna take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin' with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then
Champagne spillin', crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playin' fair

I got it bad, I'll take the black, take the navy and red
No other man has ever, ever had quite this effect
I sleep alone cause there's no room in my bed
For any other lover, you're no good to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage

But girl, you make me want to settle down with you

Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)"
1586,Bad HabitsMaxwell,"[Verse 1]
Make me crazy, don't speak no sound
I want you to prove it to me in the nude
Addicted to the way you move
Honey, if anything ever should change in you
Don't worry, I'm standing still
I'll move in with the right of will

[Chorus]

I can't control the feeling
Girl, cause I know you're here
I feel you from the floor to the ceiling

Can't escape the way you got me locked out, baby

Take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost
Will you forgive me?

[Chorus]

1587,BaBy Me',"[Verse 1]
You seem to replace your brain with your heart
You take things so hard and then you fall apart
You try to explain, but before you can start
Those cry baby tears come out of the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone's turning the handle to that faucet in your eyes
You pour it out where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body, it's why it won't fit inside
You pour it out where everyone can see

[Chorus]
They call you cry baby, cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
You'll just let them drown
You'll just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby

[Verse 2]
You're all on your own and you lost all your friends
You told yourself that it's not you, it's them
You're one of a kind and no one understands
But those cry baby tears keep coming back again

Someone's turning the handle to that faucet in your eyes
You pour it out where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body, it's why it won't fit inside

I know you better than anyone else
I have the same faucet in my eyes
So your tears are mine

They call me cry baby, cry baby

Let's do it, baby, let's do it, baby
Let's do it, do it

[Verse 1]
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Post-Chorus]
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

[Verse 2]
Lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right til the end
Oh

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Bridge]
Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Outro]
Oh, Lord
Have you ever tried sleepin' with a
Without my love
Have you ever tried, have you ever tried?"

Baby pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two

From A-T-L-A-N-T-A-N all the way down to yo' block
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla)
And the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate)
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces

Oh, oh
No, no
Ooh, Toni

[Verse 1: Toni Braxton]
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
'Til you showed me what you were about
Your true colors came out, oh
And your words couldn't hide the sin
'Cause the truth about where you been
Is in a fragrance I can't recognize

[Pre-Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Just standing there, scratching your head
Bloodshot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
I'm done with this, feeling like an idiot
Loving you, I'm over it
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

[Chorus: Toni Braxton]
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
See you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say
You're so yesterday

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Baby, what you're saying to me is
There's no more you and I
I couldn't get it right on yesterday
So kiss our tomorrows goodbye
Baby, love should brought me home
Should've just been a man about it
But now I'm crying like a baby
Girl, your love was like my blanket
Don't know what to do without it

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & Toni Braxton]
I'm standing here, pleading my case
You don't care to hear what I say
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge, oh no, baby
My promises don't mean nothing
The end is so disgusting
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

[Chorus: Toni Braxton & Trey Songz]
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
Honey, you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say, so yesterdayy

[Bridge: Toni Braxton & Trey Songz]
And now you wanna reminisce, say you wanna try again
It started with a little kiss but we can't even be friends
No, no, now I never wanna see you, never wanna feel you, never wanna hear you
I don't love you, don't need you, can't stand you no more

[Chorus: Toni Braxton & Trey Songz]
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
You, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say, so yesterdayy
So yesterday, so yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
Just because of yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday"
1591,Pretty WingsMaxwell,"[Verse 1]
Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

[Chorus]
(If I can't have you, let love set you
Free to fly your pretty wings around)
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around

[Verse 2]
I came wrong, you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby, believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies

I turned day into night
Sleep 'til I died a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times, better days
And I miss you more and more

[Chorus]
If I can't have you, let love set you
Free to fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings your

So pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Say pretty wings, oh pretty wings, yeah
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around

They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup! You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' needa try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades
Blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion
As in, going 'til they say stop
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear
And while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
All up on it, know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now
Run through your town, I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Mane""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at? Where your lighters at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

I just wanna tell the truth, man...
I just wanna tell the truth, man...
I just wanna tell the truth, man...
I just wanna tell the truth, man...

[Verse 1]
You're so fly, you're so high
Everybody around you trying to figure out why
You're so cool, you win all the time
Everywhere you go, man, you get a lot of shine
Boy like a magnet better, yet I have it
Everything you wear, people say they gotta have it
From the sweat suit to the white tee to the Gucci
You can probably say people wanna get like me

[Pre-Chorus]
But what they don't know is when you go home
And get behind closed doors, man, you hit the floor
And what they can't see is you're on your knees
So, the next time you get it, just tell them

[Chorus: Mary Mary & Kierra Sheard]
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
They think I'm so fresh
They think I'm so clean
They think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
It's the God in me (What is it, you think you see?)
It's the God in Me

[Verse 2]
You see her style, you think she's nice
You look at her whip, you say the whip tight
You look at her crib, you thinking she paid
You look at her life, you think she's got it made
But everything she got, the girl's been given
She calls it a blessing, but you call it living
When it comes to money, she can be a hero
She writes them checks with a whole lot of zeros

[Pre-Chorus]
But what they don't know is when you go home
And get behind closed doors, man, you hit the floor
And what they can't see is you're on your knees
So, the next time you get it, just tell them

[Chorus: Mary Mary & Kierra Sheard]
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me

[Bridge: Kierra Sheard]
What is it you think you see
When you see me, you see me
You don't know how much I pray
Don't know how much I gave
Don't know how much I changed
I'm just trying to explain

[Chorus: Mary Mary & Kierra Sheard]
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
They think I'm so fresh
They think I'm so clean
They think I'm so sweet

1600,ForeverDrake,"[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane"

I made you cool, you wasn't that dude
Until I started fuckin' with you
Gave you swag and a duffel bag
You left the best you had, now you gonna act like that
I got you right, I changed your life
Suicide doors I cosigned
Gucci rags, Louis travel bags
You left the best you had, baby don't look so mad

VIP was all on me
Now you're at the bar with 1 or 2 drinks
Poppin' game, you look so lame

Poppin' tags is a thing of the past
You lost the things you had chasin' them scallywags

Listen, hey sexy, tell 'em that it's over
Tell 'em you my baby and my coupe is your stroller
Tell 'em this Louis Vuitton scarf is your bib
Or that you call me daddy and my house is your crib
And if he cries, I know how to control that
Give him some bottles of this Conjure cognac
Just to shut him up, she said you wasn't half the man I am
So I guess he had to double up
He still tryin' to get back like the soldiers
Dreamin' and it's time to wake him up like Folgers
I just told her you used to put a load of
Shit up on her brain but you lame, now it's over
I keep her by my side like a holster
I plan to make a full house and I ain't talkin' 'bout poker
But I might poke her and just stroke her
Cause I'm about to treat her like a real man supposed to, Luda

[Hook: LeToya Luckett & (Ludacris)]
You must regret the day that you left me
(I know you regret it, homie)
You must regret the day that you left me

You still tryin' to get back, get back
(You can't have her back)
Still tryin' to get back, back, back with me, oh

Still tryin' to get back, get back

Yeah
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said ""I'm goin' in"" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' wit it
She said ""I seen it all"", I say ""No you fuckin' didn't""
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said ""I can't feel my legs"", I'm like ""Bitch, me neither""
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard"

Ballin' is a drug that I don´t mind abusing

Tell ya right now plex-c catch contusions
Cool as a fan, hot like a flame
Boys throwin' Haterade on me still ain´t a stain
Double shots rain, hand on Patron
Round of that white, it all depend what you on
Shawty jocking my cologne, Creed will make ya hurt
Three hundred a bottle, thirty dollars for a squirt
Got you sweatin' out ya shirt

Rockin' your Republic Apple Bottom in that House of Dereon

Take me to the V.I.P. and drive me like a foreign car
Poppin' my purple label, Ralph Lauren collar
Look like money, smell like dollars

Pop a Grey Goose bottle and let´s carry on
Grip ya Baby Phat and Trojan man carry me home

If I hit that so good, why would you wanna break up? (Gucci)
If the feeling is so good, why would you wanna break up?
(We goin' in)

[Hook: Mario (& Sean Garrett)]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you - when I'm, when I'm
Lovin' you, lovin' you; why would you wanna break up?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Now baby girl had dumped me, she no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired, she said that I been fired
On to the next one - more fish in the sea
Girls are like buses: miss one next 15 one comin'
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin' (Burr)
Swag so stupid but the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smoking doja
Baby girl went A.W.O.L, she used to be my soldier

[Verse 2: Mario]
(Don't) Don't I lace you with the Gucci?
(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louie?
(Don't) Don't I make your earlobe freeze?

Girl, I wouldn't be the same if you were with somebody else
Girl, it wouldn't be the same if I were with somebody else

The moment I been waiting on
And my soul is over flowing
With anxieties and expectations
I'm full of desires
I just want it so bad
You know
And it just seem so real

I just want reach out and touch it
Before it all disappears

Everything is passing me by
Every now and then

My ship has gone and sailed away
But I
I gonna be strong (gotta be strong)
Gotta hold on

Now the tide is coming near
I see the waves flowing
Out there on the ocean
I know my ship is coming in
Just pass the horizon
And right where the sky ends
Cause out there on the ocean
Know my ship is coming in
But don't leave me hanging
I've been waiting to long
But this moment
My ship has finally come

[Verse 2]
I would travel to the seven seas
(I would even go)
I would even go wherever the wind blows me
(I'll do anything)
I'll do anything to find my destiny
It's like fightin' with gravity
And it's bringin' me down
If this world was really round then tell me how
It took so long for you to come around

[Chorus]
Now the tide is coming near
I see the waves flowing
Out there on the ocean
I know my ship is coming in (coming in baby)
Just pass the horizon
And right where the sky ends
Cause out there on the ocean
Know my ship is coming in
But don't leave me hanging
I've been waiting to long
But this moment
My ship has finally come

[Bridge]
Finally you come (around)
Around, around
I said finally baby
Finally you come (around)
Around, around
Finally you come around, come around baby
Finally you
Finally you come
Said finally you come around (around)

Tie me down, tie me down, you ain't gon' tie me down...

Ayyy, know we been together for a minute

The kinda situation not involvin other women
And it's pretty obvious that your kinda trippin
Like ""Who the hell is this bitch?
Lookin a hot mess, what you fell for this chick?
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it""
I'm like ""You need to go somewhere else with this shit""
Because, I ain't gon' put up wit'chu
Talkin 'bout how she make you uncomfortable
Like I mean, shit I'm only 17
And um a perfect couple is only in a dream
And right now I'm pretty much away for this
Relationships? I think you should wait for it
I mean later we could try things out
But not right now

When I'm not faithful, you be feelin all pain
Now you stuck like a stain and I can't believe that
Baby girl 100, I ain't tryin to do that
Got so many girls and I ain't lettin go
Cause my life is great, and you ain't nothin but a ho
Yeah you come to my shows and you very supportive
Just show me a camera and my show recorded

1627,Say SomethingTimbaland,"[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you it’s catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa"

I ain't hearin' you
That's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you
That's not something he would do

[Verse 1]
I got a good man, even though he ain't perfect
They be hatin' him, tellin' me he ain't worth it
Tellin' me that he said and she said, when I still ain't leavin'
Instead of bringing me bad news, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
I ain't hearin' you
That's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me

I know he ain't blind, even I recognize beauty
Neither one of us minds, as long as they keep on movin'
Don't call me and disturb me 'cause I don't hear and I don't see
I hope that you're listening to me, misery gets no company

[Chorus]
I ain't hearin' you (ain't hearin' you)
That's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you (I ain't hearin' you)
That's not something he would do
I ain't hearin' you
That's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you
That's not something he would do
I ain't hearin' you (I ain't hearin' you)
That's not something he would do (no)
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you
That's not something he would do

World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen

Uhh, Big Pimpin' in the house now
Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down
Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off
Ride clean, I don't ever take the shoes off
Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off
Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard
Navigation on, tryin to find my next thrill
Feelin myself, I don't even need an X pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin in the projects
Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin on the steps
Drinkin quarter waters, I gotta be the best
M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text
Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next
Hold up

1645,SpeedinOmarion,"[Verse 1:]
When I looked over my shoulder
It got a little bit colder
It’s like I lost love from an angel
And now I’m feeling like a stranger
Abandon, I’m stranded
I gotta get back to you
I called triple A
They say they on their way
Times ticking fast
Gotta see you today

[Hook:]
But if my time is up
Let me know right now
I will find a way
To your heart again
So I’m speedin
I’m speedin (Whoa)
Speedin’

[Post Hook:]
Ugh, ugh, ooh, whoa whoa whoa
Ugh, ugh, ooh, whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 2:]
Ight, no time to be impatient
Just got the confirmation
And now I’m flying down the highway
She’s crying, ""Try love my way""
I’m with it (so with it)
Committed
To ride away with you, girl
And give you what you need
More than your eyes could ever see

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Times moving fast but not fast enough so I’m speedin’, speedin’
I’m raced and fast but not fast enough so I’m speedin, speedin’
I’m doing 90 down the highway (highway)
Gotta make this turn, I’ll be there right away, baby
Hop out the car, I’m at your door
Open it up and there you go
I gotta scoop you in my arms

1647,Nothin' On YouB.o.B,"[Chorus 1: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say hi
And I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go)

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well now you know
(Know, know, know, know)

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at
Girl you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane
Or a car or a train
No other girl's in my brain
And you the one to blame

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls

[Outro]
They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change. To love herself. To evolve"

It's Young Money Cash Money playboy
That's bout the size up
At the rooftop, so hot up in here nigga
Yeah, let's go

[Chorus: Drake]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things, have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles
Yeah, okay, they say that I'm the one, in fact
Some say that I'm their favorite but I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar, where the fuck is Stunna at?
Damn

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Untouchable 40 with my AK
Mastermind, big money heavy weight
On the grind, flipping money in every way
Headline, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white Don P, Marc Jacobs gloves
Cartier Louis case with a dope plod
From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town

Uhh, you know you paid when you got Baby with ya
It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I’m a lady twister, I kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit - blisters
Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’ll clueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers
If y'all in the building then we are intruders
Simmer down, pimpin', let me handle this
I know the game: analyst
Man I’m the shit, and y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound (Tunechi)
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town (Yeah)

See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

Is that why you get more head than shampoos?""
As-Salaam Alaykum, no oink for me
And I never let a d-boy boink for free
'Cause it's Barbie bitch, you can join the wave

Wake her up about 30 minutes later, calling me to tell me later, ""Let's go again""
Red zone, I'ma get her first down, call me Luda Drew Brees, I throw it in
Touchdown, he scores; Ludacris the MVP
With a rack like that and a back like that, Cici, better see-see me

And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S-s-s' on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything

I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it

Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment

To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim

Alright alright alright y'all settle down settle down settle down
If you don't know where you are this is Statistics 101
And I'm your teacher Lyfe Jennings in the flesh baby
Books out. Let's go!

[Verse 1]
25% of all men are unstable
25% of all men can't be faithful
30% of them don't mean what they say
And 10% of the remaining 20 is gay
That leaves you a 10% chance of ever finding your mate
That means you better pay attention to these words that I say
I'm gonna teach you how expose the 90%
And show you what to do to keep the other 10

[Hook]
Rule Number One: Don't be a booty call
If he don't respect you girl he gon forget you girl
Rule Two:
If he's in a relationship
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you
Rule Three:
Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon have to work for it
Rule Four:
Be the person you wanna find
Don't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime
Statistics

[Verse 2]
15% of all men got a complex
15% of all men don't practice safe sex
20% of them come from homes without a father
And there's a 50/50 chance that you'll marry a coward
Something to think about when you're taking a shower
Something to swallow when you're drinking bottled water
I'm gonna teach you how to expose the 90%

Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga

Got a main bitch, got a mistress (what else?)
A couple girlfriends, I'm so hood rich
Keep my dick hard and keep me smoking
You'll get bills free, shawty, no joking
And what I stand for? Brick Squad
I'ma die for this shawty, man, I swear to God
In the trap with some killers and some hood niggas
Where you at? Where you trap? You ain't hood, nigga

Nigga with a attitude like Eaze and Cube
When my little brother died, I said: ""Fuck school!""
I picked the burner up, then I grabbed some marijuana
Two years later, screaming: ""Now I'm here, your honor!""
Glock 9, the SK, if you want to beef

Who dat, who dat?
Who dat, who dat?
Who dat, who dat?

[Verse 1]
Hey, who dat, who dat? That nigga you been waiting for
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshitting, fuck it I ain't hating though
Because now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan' hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning, feeling God was never listening
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack, or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so them fiends keep on coming back

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Verse 2]
Hey, the mind state of a winner
When you thinking about summertime I'm thinking about the winter
When you thinking about breakfast I'm heating up my dinner
I was plotting this moment back when y'all was riding spinners
Yeah I'm a menace, God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet
Clown told me, “Ain't you Roc? But where the fuck your chain at?”
Guess it's something like your girl, nigga it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came me and them is not the same
It's like we all headed to Spain they took the boat I took the plane, damn
That boy's sick now hoes on his joystick
Heating up like May weather, dog I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to your day job, said you was hot? Well, they lied
Is that your girl? Well, I just G'd her, no A-Rod

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Interlude: Andre 3000]
Now who else want to fuck with Hollywood Cole?

[Verse 3]
The little engine that could, this little nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick, I heal niggas for good
A couple of y'all ain't took a field trip to the hood
And me? I'm fresh prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood
Baby, ain't saying names but we not the same
All the money and the fame don't change the fact that you lame
Might want to grab you a chain, want to tip up your hat
Might want to purchase some game, homey your shit is so wack
I got my finger on the trigger, tell that nigga, “hold that”
Want picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey, so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I'm young, black, gifted, live my life on the run
Bet your bottom dollar before I'm done
They say that I'm the one, ya nigga I'm the one
I got them saying

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World

Tell your girls you leaving, I’ll meet you in the lobby
I’m so cold, yeah, you that hot tottie
Hot tottie, hot tottie
I thought I'd never fall in love, thought I'd never fall in love with you

[Bridge: Usher]
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I need a hot tottie
Will you be my hot tottie?
She said she wanna make me better
She wanna make me better

[Verse 3: Jay Z with Usher]
They call me King Hov, copy?
They call me King Hov, copy?
They call me King Hov, copy, copy, copy?
They call me King Hov, copy? Big balling is my hobby
So much so they think I’m down with the Illuminati
My watch do illuminate, my pockets are naughty
But I’m God body, you better ask somebody
I was born a God, I made myself a king
Which means I downgraded to a human being
You was born a Goddess, I made you my queen
Which mean we upgraded to Louis the thirteen
Hot tottie, her poppy like Cognac
Her momma like herb tea, we birthed a couple of sacks
And as the tea steeped, I creeped all in her tee-pee
We did it Indian style, had the girls speaking
In tongues, she like young, you hung, what you done done
Stop it, before you wake up my mom, I might (ah)
And now that you arrived, it’s time that I go
I'm so cold, I'm so cold

[Chorus: Usher & Ester Dean]
I'm like, whoa, Kemosabe
Your body is my hobby
We freaking, this ain’t cheating as long as we tell nobody
Tell your girls you leaving, I’ll meet you in the lobby
I’m so cold, yeah, you that hot tottie
Hot tottie, hot tottie
I thought I'd never fall in love, thought I'd never fall in love with you

I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Will you be my hot tottie?
She said she wanna make me better

1691,Love The Way You LieEminem,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such
Damn, where is the fucking trust
I'm tired of the hoop and hollering
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas

Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me

And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

Dreads braided to the back
I'm chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off

Swimming trunks and bathing suits

Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night

[Verse 3]
Now she got on her fuck 'em dress
And I got on my double-breast
And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me

Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus: Kanye West, Jay Z & both]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka

Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (decide)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (no)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight (no, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
