0,0,SpeechlessDan + Shay,"[Verse 1]
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new
[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'
[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
[Bridge]
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
[Outro]
Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm

1,1,TequilaDan + Shay,"[Verse 1]
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine
[Chorus]
But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
[Verse 2]
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard
[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
[Bridge]
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in
[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
Ooh

2,2,Meant To BeBebe Rexha,"[Verse 1]
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright
[Chorus]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
[Verse 2]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Whoa, hold up girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see
[Chorus]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
[Post-Chorus]
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
Baby, if it's meant to be

Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't
[Chorus]
But if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be (Sing it, baby)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be (C'mon)
Baby, just let it be (Let's go)
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes (Come for a ride)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be (Yeah)

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

3,3,She Got The Best Of MeLuke Combs,"[Verse 1]
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it
[Pre-Chorus]
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all
[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
[Verse 2]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing along
[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
[Outro]
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me

4,4,Lose ItKane Brown,"[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
That lit up, ringing, buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
With directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear
[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up
Girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight
Yeah girl
[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between

Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby I swear
Um

I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

5,5,Best ShotJimmie Allen,"[Verse 1]
I'm just flesh and bone, heart and soul
And I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kind of things slide right out of my arms
I've struck out, I've been knocked down
More times than I can count
But that don't matter now
[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot
[Verse 2]
You saw a spark inside of me that no one else could find
Your good morning eyes, they get me high
Girl, you're always on my mind
[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot
[Bridge]
When I saw you for the first time, I knew I'd found amazing grace
It's like angels singin' every time I hear your name
When you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you, I'm not the man I was before you
[Chorus]
When you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm better than I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, God knows I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

I'm gonna give you, I'll give you my best shot
I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you, yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, yeah
Whoa, yeah

6,6,Drunk MeMitchell Tenpenny,"[Verse 1]
Some people don't know when to quit, and that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it
But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life
Wish it was, but, ooh, that would be a lie
[Chorus]
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you (There ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over (There ain't no hangover like you)
Oh, no, no, no
[Verse 2]
All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound
One sip and I'm picking up the phone tryin' not to go home without you
And that ain't nothin' but a whole lotta pain
And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink
[Chorus]
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no
Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no
Can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me
Can't get over you, no (there ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over

7,7,SixteenThomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
""Take a left here, boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio""
I just rolled my eyes and I said, ""Daddy, I know
I'm fifteen, I ain't green like some ol' ten year old""
[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free
Cruisin' up and down Main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm sixteen, sixteen, yeah
Sixteen
[Verse 2]
Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneakin' in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talkin' 'bout college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinkin' 'bout is an unsupervised Saturday night
[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be eighteen, wild and free
Buzzin' off a can of that Grizzly wintergreen
Lookin' old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen, yeah
[Bridge]
I'm old enough to smoke, I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton-Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener, and I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, and they're leavin' me behind
[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world, let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll all be alright when I'm twenty one
[Outro]
Now I'm twenty five, and I'm drinkin' wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around, and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen
"
8,8,Burning ManDierks Bentley,"[Verse 1]
Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close
[Chorus]
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
[Verse 2]
I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long
[Chorus]
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Woo!
[Bridge]
Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me
[Chorus]
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
[Outro]
Burning man

9,9,Beautiful CrazyLuke Combs,"[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild
[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep
[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her
[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me

Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do
[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on

You're an angel, you're a keeper
The kinda thing that you gotta lock down

12,12,Last ShotKip Moore,"[Verse 1]
Well, baby love's just one of them words that gets thrown around
Like a Jack and Coke, sitting on the bar, it gets watered down
So I ain't gonna say it, no I ain't gonna lie
If you want to known the truth, how I feel about you tonight
[Chorus]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down
[Verse 2]
So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long
[Chorus]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down
Last call, last chance
Last dance I was ever gonna get to take

If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey

If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya

13,13,This Is ItScotty McCreery,"[Verse 1]
Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, we're not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes
[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it
[Verse 2]
Girl, I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well, I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee
[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it
[Bridge]
Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile
[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in (Take it in)
This is a moment we won't forget (Won't forget)
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it
Yeah, this is it

14,14,MillionaireChris Stapleton,"[Chorus 1]
They say ""Love is more precious than gold""
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
[Verse 1]
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire
[Verse 2]
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury
[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire
[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

15,15,Take It From MeJordan Davis,"[Verse 1]
I think me and you should blow this off
So much for the after-party
Let's tell everybody we got lost
I think me and you should do our own thing
Our own way
At my place, far away
[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
[Verse 2]
Baby, you should stop right now, right here
Right where we wanna be
I'll spin you around and let's just see
Where this thing goes
All I know is that I'm all yours, all night
I've got nothing but time
[Chorus]
So take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Take it from me, yeah
[Bridge]
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me
[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Just take it from me
[Outro]
Take my word, take my heart
Take my kiss and maybe take it too far
But baby take it from me
Oh, just take it from me
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me
Oh, just take it from me, yeah

16,16,What Makes You CountryLuke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth
[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing
[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country
[Verse 2]
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know
[Chorus 2]
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country
[Brdge]
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out
[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country
[Outro]
You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country

17,17,Down To The HonkytonkJake Owen,"[Verse 1]
I got a house down a back road
I got a flag on the front porch
I got a dog named Waylon
I got a driveway that needs pavin'
I got a boat with a two stroke
A couple guaranteed-to-make-ya-laugh jokes
I got friends in low places
Yeah, life is what you make it
[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk
[Verse 2]
I got a girl named Shelia
She goes batshit on tequila
Got a job that gets the job done
I got a loan at the bank, it's a big one
The only place you might see my name
Is on a wall, ""For a good time, call""
I'm a local legend on a Friday night
Then a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a neon light
[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk
[Bridge]
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
(Yeah, let's go, come on)
[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk
[Outro]
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk

18,18,Love WinsCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
A stray bullet and a mama  cries
Her baby won't be coming home tonight
Sirens screaming down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa
Politics and prejudice
How the hell'd it'd ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no
And so it goes, but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause
[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins
[Verse 2]
Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believing there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah
[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins
[Bridge]
Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fighting for, yeah
[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins
Oh, yeah, love wins
[Outro]
Love will, love can, love still, love wins
Love will, love can, love still, love wins

19,19,Burn OutMidland,"[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
[Verse 1]
Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here
[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
[Verse 2]
If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
[Bridge]
Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around
[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

20,20,Here TonightBrett Young,"[Verse 1]
Hmm, if ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go
[Chorus]
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while

So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight

21,21,Make It SweetOld Dominion,"[Verse 1]
I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul-sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
[Verse 2]
Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night

The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
Life is short, make it sweet

22,22,On My Way To YouCody Johnson,"[Verse 1]
All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you
[Verse 2]
All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you
[Chorus]
Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile
[Verse 3]
I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

[Chorus]
Yeah, every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

All the boats I’ve missed
All the hell I’ve caused
All the lips I’ve kissed
All the love I’ve lost
I thank God for that

It's been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day 'til I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
'Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy

24,24,There Was This GirlRiley Green,"[Verse 1]
Never knew my old man's truck could even run like that
Should've known better than to take that curve so fast
Daddy pulled up, I was down in a ditch
And he asked me why I did what I did
[Chorus]
There was this girl, drink in her hand
Shootin' me a ""Let's get into trouble"" grin
I ain't never seen somethin' so fine
And I was doin' anything to make her mine
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
[Verse 2]
Some folks ask me why I still pick this guitar
They say livin' that life on the road won't get you very far
I say man you should've been down in Tupelo
Seen what was in the front row
[Chorus]
There was this girl, beer in her hand
Shootin' me a ""Play a little Skynyrd"" grin
She's turnin' it up, she's turnin' me on
And I'd play her anything she'd sing along
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl
[Verse 3]
Didn't know a diamond ring could cost so much (Damn)
Took six months on a farm 'fore I saved up
All my drinkin' buddies still out on the town
Wonderin' why I ever settled down
[Chorus]
But there was this girl, holdin' my hand
Shootin' me a ""Start a life together"" grin
She's pullin' me in, she's straightenin' me out
And now I know what love is all about
I'm still out of my mind, she's still out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl
There was this girl

I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes

I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them

I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)
[Verse 2]
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)

Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like ""'Could y'all get any closer?""
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling

What d'you say we make it true?

Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too

Girl, I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe
[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
[Verse 2]
Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

Looks like we ain't leavin' now

Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

30,30,Neon ChurchTim McGraw,"[Verse 1]
I need Jesus or I need whiskey
Whatever works best to get me through
Gettin' over you
A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders just like me
Yeah, what I need
[Chorus]
Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
[Verse 2]
Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?
I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt, don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now
[Chorus]
Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
[Bridge]
Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night
In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling
[Chorus]
I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
I need a neon church

31,31,Turnin' Me OnBlake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burning through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch
[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes, I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on
[Verse 2]
Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like
[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on
[Bridge]
Once she gets it started, man, it's all night long
She's the needle on the vinyl of a midnight song
She's turning me on, turning me on
[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on, yeah

32,32,Never Comin DownKeith Urban,"[Verse 1]
I can feel it coming on now
As the music plays
Taking shots with the night owls
As the world just fades away
Got a paycheck in my pocket
'Bout to get it all gone
Light it up like a rocket
We're going all night long
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody sing ooh, mmm
I love it when you ooh

When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
When I take you by the hand, dancin’

Tear the top right off the ceiling

Tell me now, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never, ever, never coming down

Coming up right here, right now
I wanna see you move and hear you sing it out loud

33,33,Eyes On YouChase Rice,"[Verse 1]
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault
[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room
[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view

With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare
[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

I don’t know about you
But I never come into this bar
On a Thursday before 10 o’clock
But I thought what the hell, why not?
I don’t know about you
But I never walk up and talk to
A stranger but when I saw you
I had to, I just had to
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know your favourite beer
'Cause you told me and I bought it
You can leave me sitting right here
But if you feel like talking
[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)
What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin round and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you
[Verse 2]
I don’t know about you
We can dip, we can slip out the back
Flee the scene, put your feet on my dash
Find a spot past the railroad tracks and never look back
But before that

What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?

And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

I know you like Bud Light
I know you got blue eyes
I know you got my heart beating in this bar
Tonight we can jump in, fall into something
And the perfect place to start is

What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of sleeping on us
I'm over dodging this crush
I'm sick of waiting 10 minutes just text you back
So you don't get to thinking that I'm too attached
I'm more than benefit friends
I'm more than just a weekend binge
I want you to be my hottie riding shotty
I don't want nobody's body but your body, babe
All I'm trying to say is
[Chorus 1]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference
Yeah I do
[Verse 2]
I wanna be the difference between “Hey what's up?” and “What we gonna do tonight?”
Between yeah she's cool we hang out sometimes and that girl right there she's mine
Between leading you on and holding your hand
Sitting it out and girl let's dance
Between playing it safe and taking a chance
Yeah pumping the brakes or hitting the gas
[Chorus 2]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference
[Bridge]
Close the distance
And be that puzzle piece you didn't even know you was missing babe
Oh I wanna be the difference
Yeah I do
[Chorus 3]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in  “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference I am
Well I wanna be the difference

36,36,Caught Up In The CountryRodney Atkins,"[Verse 1]
Square bales, flatbeds
Clothesline, sunsets
Sky blue, barn red
Wind chimes, front porch
Good dogs, wood floors
Work boots, open doors
And miles and miles of John Deere green
Freedom far as I can see
A road to run and room to breathe
That's who I am and I'll always be
[Chorus]
Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me
With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country
[Verse 2]
Just look at 'em stars
Must be a billion of 'em
They just doing they thing
Right where God put 'em

If this ain't heaven it's halfway there
You can feel it in the air

Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be

Caught up in the country (I was brought up in it)
Caught up in the country (Oh and good Lord willin')

Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me (I was brought up in it)

A road to run and room to breathe

38,38,Love Ain'tEli Young Band,"[Verse 1]
Hotels are made for two night stays, checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't
[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't
[Verse 2]
Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark
That sad song it was written just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate

Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone

I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't

White collar, blue collar, hillbilly, high dollar
Hot head, pot head, non-believer, holy water
Big city, small town, y'all take a look around
People are different
Heavy metal, hip hop, steel toe, flip flops
Sip it slow, cold beer, hits you fast, whiskey shot
Accent North, South, good as gold, sailor mouth
People are different
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, we all know it's true
But it don't mean that me and you
[Chorus]
Can't walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
People are different

Left wing, right wing, jail house, freedom ring
Old school, new school, everything in-between
Like a snowflake, no fingerprint's the same
And people are different

I wish that it was something that we all understood
Lord knows it'd do us all some good
[Chorus]
To walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor

Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes

This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
Yeah, people are different

You can turn on the TV
Change the channel if you don't like what you see
You can get your money back if it ain't your size
You can throw it in the trash if you don't like it
But listen, people are different

So walk down the street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different

If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself
I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher
But I'm a believer
[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
[Verse 2]
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
[Chorus 2]
Every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl, even today, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
I prayed for you
I prayed for you

You're in it
Every single good time
When I press rewind in my mind yeah I find
You're in it
Every thought of what could be
All I see is you and me
In my dreams and everything
I don't know what the future holds
All I know is girl you're in it
[Verse 2]
There's a small town cafe corner booth
Where I first laid my eyes on you
A melody that I keep singing
There's a baptist church on a county road
With everyone that we both know
There's wedding bells and a long white veil
[Chorus]
You're in it
Every single good time
When I press rewind in my mind yeah I find
You're in it
Every thought of what could be
All I see is you and me
In my dreams and everything
I don't know what the future holds
All I know is girl you're in it
Yeah, girl you're in it
[Bridge]
Fifty years on down the line
There's a rocking chair right next to mine
And girl you're in it
Yeah
[Chorus]
You're in it
Every single good time
When I press rewind in my mind yeah I find
You're in it
Every thought of what could be
All I see is you and me
In my dreams and everything
I don't know what the future holds
All I know is girl you're in it
Yeah, girl you're in it
Oh, girl you're in it
Yeah, you're in it

45,47,Back To LifeRascal Flatts,"[Verse 1]
She got that ""hey y'all"" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring
[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time
[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does
[Verse 2]
She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping
[Pre-Chorus]
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time
[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
[Outro]
Oh, she does
Back to life

46,49,Better BoatKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone
More than I'd like to, but I’m okay with stayin' home
My how the last few months have changed
I’m smilin' more despite the pain
[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat
[Verse 2]
I hate waitin', ain't no patience in these hands
I'm not complainin', sometimes it's hard to change a man
I think I'm stronger than I was
I let God do what he does
[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin'  out

I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out

If it's workin', I don't know, when I get done the thing may not float
But I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

47,50,GIRLMaren Morris,"[Verse 1]
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out
[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?
[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?

Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low

48,51,I Hate ThisTenille Arts,"[Verse 1]
I hate this here I am running into you, trying not to touch
I hate this acting like it's not killing me when it does
And that watch I gave you still looks good on your wrist
Don't you think it's time we end this little experiment?
[Chorus]
'Cause I know we said we'd just be friends
I can't lie and I can't pretend
Boy, I've tried and bottom line is
I still love you and I hate this
[Verse 2]
I hate this missin' you, hoping you're somewhere missin' me
I hate this hoping you'll call, hoping I'm awake when it rings
If we took this break to figure out what we wanted (What we wanted)
Well, I want us back, don't need another night to sleep on it

'Cause I know we said we'd just be friends
I can't lie and I can't pretend

49,52,Ain't Nothin' To ItCody Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Same old scenario
One guy's young and one guy's old
One's in love and sittin' on dough
And one's already walked that road
One's on year number 33
And one just bought that diamond ring
One says ""Dad, so how'd you do it?""
The other just laughs and says ""There ain't nothin' to it""
[Chorus]
Just try to quit smokin' and reel back the drinkin'
Don't always tell her everything you're thinkin'
And dance her when she needs dancin'
You get up and go to work, get up and go to church
Crawl up in that bed right next to her and listen
Instead of having all the answers
Then he slapped him on the back and said
""Son, you can breathe, there ain't nothin' to it""
[Verse 2]
There'll be trouble along the way
Words will fly and dishes break
The baby comes in and money goes out
You will learn to ride the ups and downs
You'll wanna quit a million times
But if you hang on, the years unwind
And when you get to see your blushing bride
Turn beautiful at 35, or 45, or 55
[Chorus]
You'll be glad you quit smokin' and reeled back the drinkin'
Didn't always tell her everything you were thinkin'
And danced her when she needed dancin'
You got up and went to work, got up and went to church
Crawled up in that bed right next to her and listened
Instead of having all the answers
It's only love and all of us go through it
And if I had to do it again you know I'd do it
There ain't nothin' to it
No, there ain't nothin' to it

50,53,Nothin' On YouCody Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Wearing your black dress, red shoes
Makeup, perfume, and diamonds
You always impress, turn heads
The second you walk through the door
You're like a real life work of fine art
Baby, you're priceless
And I just wanna get on, get that black dress down on the floor
[Chorus]
'Cause when you got nothin' on
There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's all I wanna do
I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you
[Verse 2]
You're better than Venice, Vegas, New York, LA, Paris
Baby you're Vermont in the fall
The Grand Canyon on a full moon
Oh and they can keep those highrise, high price mansions
I wouldn't trade places
Long as I'm here with you baby
I've got a room with a view
[Chorus]
'Cause when you got nothin' on
There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's all I wanna do
I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you

Yeah, 'cause I've seen the mountains high

51,54,Nothing To Do TownDylan Scott,"[Verse 1]
It ain't New York City
And it ain’t LA
We ain't got no rooftop bars
Like they do on Broadway
[Pre-Chorus]
It's just a little town square, middle of nowhere
Ain’t even big enough to be a map dot
We ain't got a lot but we sure do a lot
With the little bit that we got
[Chorus]
We got a little somethin'-somethin' we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
With your girl and your boys by a fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some George Strait songs that we turn up loud
Livin' it up 'til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there’s nothing to do?
Who said there’s nothing to do
In this nothing-to-do town?
[Verse 2]
Yeah, our way of living, no it ain't complicated
Don’t knock it 'til you try it, yeah, you might not hate it
Around here we work and we play, cuss and we pray
And at the end of a long, hard day
[Chorus]
We got a little somethin'-somethin' we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon’s up high
With your girl and your boys by a fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some Brooks & Dunn songs that we turn up loud
Livin' it up 'til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there's nothing to do
In this nothing-to-do town?

It's just a little town square, middle of nowhere
Ain't even big enough to be a map dot
We ain't got a lot but we sure do a lot

We got a little somethin'-somethin' we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
With your girl and your boys, by a fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some Tim McGraw songs that we turn up loud
Livin' it up 'til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there's nothing to do
In this nothing-to-do town?

52,55,Friends Don'tMaddie,"[Verse 1]
They don't cancel other plans
Have conversations with nothin' but their eyes
They don't hear each other's names and forget to concentrate
Hits a nerve and lights you up like dynamite
[Chorus]
Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell ya why
They just felt like saying ""hi""
Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys
Finding reasons not to leave
Trying to hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow (slow)
Take the long way home (home)
Get a little too close (close)
We do but - but friends don't
[Verse 2]
They don't almost say ""I love you""
When they're downtown somewhere, just a little drunk
They don't talk about the future and put each other in it
And get chills with every accidental touch
[Chorus]
Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell ya why
They just felt like saying ""hi""
Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys
Finding reasons not to leave
Trying to hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow (slow)
Take the long way home (home)
Get a little too close (close)
We do but - but friends don't
[Bridge]
I keep telling myself this might be nothing
(This might be nothing)
But one look in your eyes and, God, there's something
(There's something)
You can lie to me and say you don't
But I know you do, and I love you too

Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell ya why
They just felt like saying ""hi""
Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys
Finding reasons not to leave
Trying to hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow (slow)
Take the long way home (home)
Get a little too close (close)
We do but - but friends don't
Friends don't

53,56,Really Shouldn't Drink Around YouTeddy Robb,"[Verse 1]
You say that we can be friends, but, hey, let's be honest
There ain't really no such thing as gin and platonic
Hey, one is gonna turn into two is gonna turn into
You and me at a quarter to three with four shoes under the bed
Yeah, we know it's headed to
[Chorus]
I really shouldn't drink around you
It's a risk, it's a gamble
A little more than I can handle
Just a touch of a buzz is enough to get me thinkin' things
I really shouldn't think about you
We end up on a fast track
Gettin' back to where we left the past at
You think I would'a learned my lesson by now, but I never do
I really shouldn't drink around you
(I shouldn't drink around you, really shouldn't drink around you)
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know what's gonna happen if we order another shot
There ain't any way to muster up the strength that I haven't got
Well, wine is gonna turn into, ""Why not?""
And turning the lights off, blurring the lines and in no time
We're doin' things that friends don't do
[Chorus]
I really shouldn't drink around you
It's a risk, it's a gamble
A little more than I can handle
Just a touch of a buzz is enough to get me thinkin' things
I really shouldn't think about you
We end up on a fast track
Gettin' back to where we left the past at
You think I would'a learned my lesson by now, but I never do
I really shouldn't drink around you, oh yeah
I really shouldn't drink around you

You say that we can be friends, but, hey, let's be honest
There ain't really no such thing as gin and platonic

54,57,What Whiskey DoesRandy Houser,"[Chorus]
I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gon' drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does
[Verse 1]
Well, maybe it'll make me lose my mind
Well, maybe it'll help me forget this time
Well, maybe it'll put my fist through the wall
Make me pick up the phone and give you a call
Maybe it'll take me somewhere I've never been
Make the world stand still, and make the whole room spin
Maybe make me dance, make me cry
Hell, I don't know, but I know tonight
[Chorus]
I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gonna drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does
[Verse 2]
Well maybe it'll buy this bar a round
Or turn my ass upside down
Maybe it'll make me a fly on the wall
Or stand me up ten feet tall
Maybe it'll take me to a better place
And put a smile back on my face
Maybe it'll make me hate myself
Or fall in love with somebody else
[Chorus]
But I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gonna drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does
[Bridge]
And maybe it'll talk me off the ledge I've been on lately
Maybe it'll heal me, maybe it'll kill me, yeah, maybe
[Chorus]
But I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
And drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

But sometimes I sit here just because
I wanna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road

We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand

I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans

When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

Puttin' miles on a run-down van

There's a diamond sky that's waitin' for us just outside of town

Wanna make the distance razor thin

It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

58,61,Every Little Honky Tonk BarGeorge Strait,"[Verse 1]
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank, ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar
[Chorus]
Friday night, it's a given
I'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
I'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar
[Verse 2]
Neon lights flashing bright 'til you're almost hypnotized
Waitress, short skirt, gets hit on by every guy
Comin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow
Bartender, pour our drinks; Código, do a shot
You think you're tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says you're not
You step outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night, it's a given

60,63,ButterfliesKacey Musgraves,"[Verse 1]
I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue, I fell for you
[Chorus 1]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
[Verse 2]
Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you
[Chorus 1]
And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies
Ooh, mmm, mmm
[Chorus 2]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies

61,64,All To MyselfDan + Shay,"[Verse 1]
I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night
[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself
[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmmm)

We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms

62,65,Raised On CountryChris Young,"[Verse 1]
Got a little southern drawl in my talk
Little pickup truck on my highway
Got a little boot stomp in my walk
Little neon lighting my Friday
Got some Tennessee in my whiskey
Raise a cup up if you with me
[Chorus]
I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country
[Verse 2]
It's the only reason that I survived
Every breakup and every party
It's the soundtrack to my life
It runs deep in my DNA
[Chorus]
I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country
I was raised on country
[Bridge]
(Raised on country music)
Learned a lot about living and a little 'bout love
(Raised on country music)
And you know that's something I'm so proud of

I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie

63,66,Some Of ItEric Church,"[Verse 1]
Beer don't keep
Love’s not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right
[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's gotta past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again
[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
[Bridge]
When you can take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand
[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
Some of it

64,67,Space CowboyKacey Musgraves,"[Verse 1]
You look out the window while I look at you
Saying I don't know would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore
[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does, too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy
[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town
[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space
[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy

I've been baptised
By the fire in your touch
And the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
[Verse 1]
Well the whole town's talking
About the line I'm walking
That leads right to your door
Oh how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone
I used to have a wild side
They say a country-mile-wide
I'd burn those beer joints down
That's all changed now
You turned my life around

[Verse 2]
I used to love them and leave them
I'd brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down

Now my heart beats true
Baby you and me together
Feels more like forever
Than anything I've ever known
We're right on track
I ain't looking back

Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ""ya'll come back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground

I drive home the same way, two left turns off the interstate
And she's always standing at the stoplight on 18th Street
She could be a Sarah, she could be an Emily
An Olivia, maybe Cassidy
With the shaky hands on the cardboard sign
And she's lookin' at me
[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Countin' change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
And I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her
She's somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
[Verse 2]
Did she give up wondering where the cars all go?
And can she even tell that I don't know what to say?
So I just nod my head and wave
Well, no one's gonna ask what she wants to be
Or why we're both stuck here at the mercy of geography
And whether it shines or rains
[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Countin' change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
Oh, and I'll wonder how she fell and no one caught her
She's somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter

Oh, I don't know the reasons why
I'm the one who's driving by
And she's the one on the corner of 18th Street

Bet she was somebody's best friend
Back when she was somebody's sister (Somebody's daughter)
Bet she was somebody's first kiss, oh
Dancing in a gym where the kids all talk about someday, someday
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
Oh, and I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her
She's somebody's daughter

Mile by mile and
City by city she's
Gettin' over me, and man it ain't pretty, no

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, man I would
Try and make her see
That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that

Where she was headed now
I'd do what I had to do
To make her turn that car around

Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

Or hauled a little hay
But if you think your boots got more dirt than mine

My town’s smaller than your town
And I got a bigger buck and bass on my wall

I got a car parked in my front yard
With a floorboard full of Slim Jims
I piss where I want to

But I’m rednecker than you, I'm rednecker than you (Woo!)
[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm down with the sound of a dixie whistle
Raising hell, praising Dale twelve in at Bristol
More sweat on my brow at the end of the day
So needless to say
[Chorus]
My town's smaller than your town
I got a bigger buck and bass on my wall
And I ain't tryin' to talk no smack
It's just the facts y'all
'Cause my truck's louder than your truck
And my red white's a little more blue (Damn right!)
You might think that you're redneck
But I'm rednecker than you, I'm rednecker than you

76,79,I HopeGab,"[Verse 1]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah
[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
[Verse 2]
Yeah then I hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
[Bridge]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now
[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
Like you did on me

77,80,To A TRyan Hurd,"[Verse 1]
Take off your makeup, nobody's around
It's you and me, girl, just let your guard down
I see right through you, I know what it means
I know I got you, the moment when you close your eye-eye-eyes
I know I'm doing something right-ight-ight

About the way-ay-ay

Don't worry, baby
'Cause driving you crazy is all I ever wanted

Now that I got you down to a t-shirt
White sheets and red wine, mmm
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know I know what you need tonight
Girl, I'll take my ti-ime, dot every I, I, baby, I, I
I got you down to a T

Whoa

Got you down, got you down

Uh, yeah
This town ain't got no nightclub
We don't need the neon lights
Girl, I got that '87 gassed up
Thirty early out there in your drive
Got you a Bullet and a koozie, keep it ice cold
You take a sip 'fore we get gone
Lookin' at you with your hand out the window
I'm turnin' right while you're turnin' me on, yeah

Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round

Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

Out there where the moon hits the water
Out there where your lips hit mine

With you there ridin' shotgun, yeah
All our friends are probably makin' plans, baby
Yeah, but we already got one
We'll be

79,82,World For TwoKing Calaway,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think this world's too much
All the hurt, all the hate, all it takes is a human touch
It's so easy to get lost in the light
Make a change, make a choice, all the noise, we can drown it out
[Chorus]
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
[Verse 2]
Kiss me like there's no one else for miles
Take it fast, take it slow, letting go for a little while
Heaven's so close to the both of us
For the rest of the night we can fly, we can rise above
[Chorus]
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two (Oh)
[Bridge]
Girl, for you (I'd build a world)
For two (I'd build a world)
Girl, for you (I'd build a world)
For two, yeah

Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two

80,83,Rockin' All Night LongAdam Hambrick,"[Verse 1]
There were Chevys and levees, whiskey and rye
Friends, no end to the summertime
Gas was cheap and the radio was free
So were we on those back streets
Chasing good times and pretty girls
'Cause when you're young your whole world is
[Chorus]
Bloodshot eyes, watch the sun rise
Sleep when you die phase of life
It's a full heart, falling hard
Singing songs to her in the dark
Drinking up every moment 'til it's gone
Just rockin' all night long
[Verse 2]
There's a ""know when you know"" kinda feeling you get
When that light strikes on a first kiss
When she smiled, I had no doubts
So I put a ring on the finger I was wrapped around
We were midnight, holding on
Giving in to what the heart wants
[Chorus]
It was a bloodshot eyes, watch the sun rise
Sleep when you die phase of life
It's a full heart, falling hard
Singing songs to her in the dark
And drinking up every moment 'til it's gone
Just rockin' all night long
[Bridge]
Now it's 2am and I'm in a rocking chair
And a row of pink everywhere
She's got her mama's smile and lungs like her dad
She's the best reason I ever had
[Chorus]
For a bloodshot eyes, watch the sun rise
Sleep when you die phase of life
It's a full heart, falling hard
Singing songs to her in the dark
And drinking up every moment 'til it's gone
Yeah we're gonna be here 'til the break of dawn
Just rockin' all night long
Just rockin' all night long
Just rockin' all night
Rockin' all night long

81,84,God's CountryBlake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country
[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
[Verse 2]
We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
[Interlude]
(This is God's country)
God's country

I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around

My baby, she's Alabama
A dixie land delight, kissin' me like molasses
Slow and sweet, mhm, just right
She's an endless August summer, yeah, sunshine 3-6-5
When she forgets the punch line, it still gets me every time

83,86,Knockin' BootsLuke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh
[Verse 2]
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty

84,87,Remember You YoungThomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
Hey, buddies that I grew up with
All straight-laced and married up now
You ain't foolin' me, wasn't long ago
We tore the roof off that one red light town
And hey, darlin', sippin' that red wine
All classy, kicked back on the couch
You smile and I see ya shootin' tequila
Us shuttin' them college bars down

And no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much we grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

No, you won’t be that little for long
One day, you’ll move away, but you’re still gonna stay
This innocent after you’re gone

And no matter how much you grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever

Saw a young Mama laughin' talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you
[Verse 2]
Saw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hiding their Corona
Like kids do
And I thought about you
[Pre-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not
[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you
[Verse 3]
I saw ""hungry"" misspelled on a cardboard sign
And a dirty t-shirt that said ""Roll Tide""
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you
[Verse 4]
Ran into a buddy, he said ""How long's it been?""
I said ""A couple years,"" he said ""Boy, it's been ten""
That's what time'll do
And I thought about you

I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever

And I thought about you
I thought about you

Everything love is
And everything it's not

I watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky
For a minute or two
And I thought about you

86,89,The Ones That Didn't Make It Back HomeJustin Moore,"[Verse 1]
Tour was up middle of June
She was plannin' a welcome home barbecue
Green bean casserole, grandma's recipe
There was a knock on the door around two o'clock
Two uniforms and her heart stopped
Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree, blowin' in the breeze
[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home
[Verse 2]
The whole town shut down, the whole town showed up
Sang Amazing Grace, watched a slide show of
His 22 years, there was laughs and there was tears
And that preacher talked about sacrifice
And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights
Johnny sold beer half priced that night
And everybody raised 'em high singin'
[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home
[Bridge]
Back to that front porch
Back through that front door
To the life they were fightin' for
[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones that didn't make it back home

87,90,LivingDierks Bentley,"[Verse 1]
This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear
[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'
[Verse 2]
I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said ""Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough""
[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'
[Post-Chorus]
Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living
It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear
[Chorus]
Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'
[Post-Chorus]
Livin' like you'll never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missin'
Some days you're living
Some days you're living

88,92,Neon MoonBrooks,"[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of losing you
[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon
[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
[Verse 2]
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart she'll come back someday
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon
[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
[Verse 3]
The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think:
This hurt inside of me ain't never gonna end
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon
[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
[Outro]
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

89,93,Beer Never Broke My HeartLuke Combs,"[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss
[Pre-Chorus]
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down
[Chorus]
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
[Verse 2]
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now
[Chorus]
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one
[Chorus]
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart

90,94,What If I Never Get Over YouLady Antebellum,"[Verse 1]
It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart
But to movin' on is the hardest part
It comes in waves, the letting go
But the memory fades, everybody knows
Everybody knows
[Chorus]
What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
[Verse 2]
Maybe months go by, maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's workin' out
Every now and then, he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him
Yeah, all I  see is you

What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

Ooh yeah
What if I never get over?
What if I never get closure?
What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya?
What if It never gets better?
What if this lasts forever and ever and ever?
[Chorus]
I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got?
What if your love was my one and only shot?
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to
What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over
What if I never get over you?
[Outro]
What if I never get over you?
Oh, what if I never get over?
Over you
"
91,95,We WereKeith Urban,"[Verse 1]
We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine
[Chorus]
And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm
[Verse 2]
We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand
[Chorus]
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
""Pour Some Sugar On Me""
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm
[Chorus]
We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin’ out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mmm, yes, I do
[Outro]
My friends say
""Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her""
Just wasn't meant to be
But somewhere down deep, I still believe
That we were
"
92,96,SouthboundCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around
[Chorus]
To get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
[Verse 2]
Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock and it's only 2 o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
[Chorus]
We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Woo!
[Bridge]
Yeah, we got the rope swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water ride here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers and you and me
Gotta love this time of year
Getting southbound, southbound
[Chorus]
So let's get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Let's get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah

I ain't watching TV today
Bad news, it can just stay away
If you ain’t got anything good to say
Then shut your mouth
I got my windows down and my blinders on
Radio set to my favorite song
All green lights on the road I'm on
Man, there ain't no doubt
[Chorus]
I’m getting them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time

Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye

I'm living this good life

94,98,Beer Can't FixThomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags
[Pre-Chorus]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'
[Chorus]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
[Verse 2]
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin' is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin', watchin' your team losin' that championship ring
And you're feelin like life ain't fair
[Pre-Chorus]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
[Chorus]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix (Yeehaw)
[Bridge]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it for no special occasion
[Chorus]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away, no
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely (Lonely)
Heartbroken (Heartbroken)
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick (So quick)
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down, it will do the trick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

95,99,Proof I've Always Loved YouGyth Rigdon,"[Verse 1]
Traveled a thousand lonely miles over roaring oceans and stormy skies
But always felt inside a truth
Was always there in the back of my mind
And I was scared, all alone inside
What it was, I never knew
[Chorus]
'Til I met you
And I just knew
I was alone the dark, your image lit up my heart
Recognized the light the second I saw your eyes
It was you
Proof I’ve always loved you, oh whoa
I’ve always loved you
[Verse 2]
The bar was set high when I was a child
Someone for everyone to love and treat you right
I figured they skipped right over me
I was down in trouble, I’d get unstuck
Just chalked it up to having good luck
Told them it was something they just couldn't see
[Chorus]
'Til I met you
And I just knew
I was alone the dark, your image lit up my heart
Recognized the light the second I saw your eyes
It was you
Proof I’ve always loved you, oh whoa
I’ve always loved you, oh whoa
[Bridge]
Given just one week in that short time
I felt I'd known you my whole life
How could anyone else be able to know me so well?
Before I even bluff, she knows my tells
I felt your touch, your warm smile
It’s what I felt inside when I was alone and tired
I was gone on the run, warm from the sun
Was a love I couldn't find from anyone
And just one week, and that's your time
Felt I've known you my whole love
How could anyone else ever know me so well?
Before I even bluff, she knows my tells
I felt your touch, your warm smile
It’s what I felt inside when I was alone and tired
I was gone on the run, warm from the sun
Was a love I couldn't find from anyone
[Chorus]
'Til I met you
And I just knew
I was alone the dark, your image lit up my heart
Recognized the light the second I saw your eyes
It was you
Proof I’ve always loved you
It's proof I’ve always loved you

96,100,I Don't Remember Me (Before You)Brothers Osborne,"[Verse 1]
Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?
What gave me life and took my breath away?
Did I take a last-call stranger home
So I wouldn't have to wake up alone?
[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
[Verse 2]
Was I just another ghost in this town?
Who was I when no one was around?
Did I even know that I was livin' without?
Who are my favorite songs about?
[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
[Bridge]
Was my heart beatin' in my chest?
And was I even alive before the day we met?
[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin' like a child, son
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
No, I don't remember me before you

But they're all headin' home now
And I got word that she's hangin' downtown
I know I shouldn't do it
Oh, but these shots I'm shootin' make me not give a damn
[Chorus]
And now it's one more last time, we swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains

But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later

Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone

I can still see your blue sky blue eyes hangin' on a mango kiss
Hear the waves and the breeze and the Joshua trees
Was just about as good as it gets
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind like I'm right there again
[Chorus]
Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
[Verse 2]
The second I left I was kickin' myself
'Cause I knew I should've stayed
Still tequila love drunk, from us wakin' up
Under the Cabo palm leaf shade
And it's crazy I know, but I'd give anything to go
To you and me on that coast, in the midnight glow
[Chorus]
Of a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
[Bridge]
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind, like I'm right there again
[Chorus]
Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
Under a moon over Mexico
Over Mexico

106,110,Refrigerator DoorLuke Combs,"[Verse 1]
There's daddy on his John Deere, brand new in '96
Beside me and Bandit playing fetch when I was a kid
A Save the Date, best day of my best buddies life
Anybody else could walk on by, and not blink an eye
[Chorus]
'Cause they're just pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
Just the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door
[Verse 2]
My first day of kindergarten when I was 5 years old
A postcard that my cousin sent from Cancun, Mexico
A list of what Mama needs from the IGA today
Is just one small part of a work of art signed Kenmore in '98
[Chorus]
With all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door
[Bridge]
As life flies by, it spills onto the side
Until it's covered top to bottom with the best days of your life
[Chorus]
And all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that you've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's our lives on the 'frigerator door
On the 'frigerator door

107,111,Lovin' On YouLuke Combs,"[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
[Verse 2]
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth
[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you
[Chorus]
Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you

108,112,One Thing RightMarshmello,"[Verse 1]
I've cheated and I’ve lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I’ve got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure
[Pre-Chorus]
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door
[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don’t like
Runnin’ with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I’ve been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

Mmm
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you

You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I changed
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (To walk away)

When I was gettin' crazy, reckless, and wild
Actin' like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (Find its place)

I’ve been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right

109,113,Tip Of My TongueKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
I love the dimples in the small of your back
The way they're speaking to me just like that
Red wine made my imagination run
Oh, I can taste it on the tip of my tongue

Let it run, let it roll

110,114,It All Comes Out In The WashMiranda Lambert,"[Verse 1]
If you wear a white shirt to a crawfish boil
Stonewashed jeans while you're changing the oil
When you find yourself dating the bridesmaid's ex
You accidentally bring him to the wedding, whoops
If you pour yourself a Merlot to go
You dip your fries in your ketchup on a bumpy road
You spill the beans to your mama, sister got knocked up
In a truck at the 7-Eleven, don't sweat it
[Chorus]
'Cause it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin
[Verse 2]
You got frisky with your boss at the copy machine
You drunk-dialed your ex-husband, don't remember a thing
Had a fancy dinner at your mother-in-law's
Spilled A1 Sauce on her table cloth
Don't sweat it, a Tide stick will get it
[Chorus]
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
And it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin
Put that sucker on spin
You gotta put that sucker on spin
[Bridge]
And the laundry list goes like this
Every teardrop, every white lie
Every dirty cotton sheet, let it line dry
All the mistakes, all the wild streaks
That's why the good Lord made bleach, oh-oh
[Chorus]
'Cause it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin
Put that sucker on spin
Yeah, put that sucker on spin

Yeah, you put that sucker on spin

111,115,Dive BarGarth Brooks,"[Verse 1-Garth Brooks]
Well turn that bottle up and drink it
Crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions
Situation no conditions
Oh and memories we all need to drown
So fill your cup
Raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir
[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar
[Verse 2-Blake Shelton]
'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis
It's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios to wishes wasted on them falling stars
[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar
[Bridge]
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some bar stool believers
Wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just going where the neon glows
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah we're just never quite belongers
Hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzing where the neon glows
[Pre-Chorus-Both]
Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are
[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, ya'll so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar

112,116,Have You Ever Seen The RainWillie Nelson,"[Verse 1]
Someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm
I know it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day
I know; shining down like water
[Chorus]
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?

'Til forever, on it goes through the circle, fast and slow
I know it can't stop, I wonder

Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
[Verse 1]
I picked you up with a cowboy nod at the hotel bar
It was less than eight seconds, girl, you stole my heart
We had drinks and smokes, played your songs on guitar
I was crazy out the gate and you were wild from the start
You hopped in my Bronco and we had the time of our life
We've come a long way since then, girl
But it's been one hell of a ride
[Chorus]
Love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

Girl, there's something kind of dangerous about the way you move
I knew it wouldn't be easy hanging on to you
'Cause when you hit the light, put your lips on mine
It gets hotter than a Houston night

Yeah, love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on

114,118,More Hearts Than MineIngrid Andress,"[Verse 1]
I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now
[Verse 2]
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road
[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
[Verse 3]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive
[Chorus]
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
[Bridge]
Oh
Mmh
[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine

Yeah, I'm ready if you're ready or wonderin'
Stop thinking, hit send

Doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk

Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

[Verse 2]
A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to ""She's Every Woman""
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign

117,121,Soon You'll Get BetterTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too

You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal

I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try

I wish girls you loved never gave back diamond rings
I wish every porch had a swing
Wish kids still learned to say ""sir"" and ""ma'am"", how to shake a hand
I wish every state had a Birmingham

I wish everybody knew all the words to Mama Tried
I wish Monday mornings felt just like Friday nights

I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time

120,124,Chasin' YouMorgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then
[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you

Hey momma, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillowcase?
Cure a one-too-many headache?
Momma can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress
[Chorus]
How does he sleep at night?
Momma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma, can you die from a broken heart?
[Verse 2]
Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Momma, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away
[Chorus]
How does he sleep at night?
Momma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart
[Bridge]
Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard?
(Prayin' so hard)
Can you go blind from crying in the dark?
(In the dark)
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?
[Chorus]
How does he sleep at night?
Momma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
How does he sleep at night?
Momma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma, can you die from a broken heart?

Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Do people assume
You're always alright?
Been so good at smiling
Most of your life
[Pre-Chorus]
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?

Oh

Hey, homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtain's closed?
Did your Daddy teach you
How to act tough?
Or more like your Mama
Sweep it under the rug?

Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?

Got a grip on a koozie if it's what she likes

All I want is to fall in deeper
Than I've ever been
Why won't you let me?

Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim

Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And ""I've done it outta love"" is not enough
But God, how I wish it was

How much lonely I can take before you lose me
Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me

Well I got a call from Rowdy ‘round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open

The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune

But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

Buttoned down shirt and a good pair of jeans
Wasn’t Sunday supper without collard greens
Dad was boss, Christ is king
Friday night was livin' for them lights to come on
Then I turned to Miller Lites when I turned 21
There's some things about me that I can’t change
I'll always be the man that home made

Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make

Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made

Since you've been gone I've had to find different ways to grieve
There's days that I don't even want it on my mind but tonight I’m weak

So I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscing by myself

I gotta say missin' you comes in waves
And tonight I'm drowning

Did a little somethin' like find a flight

[Chorus]
Don’t even know what she’ll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I’m hers in the blink of an eye
She don’t take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight
[Bridge]
And I don’t know how I got to be the only thing she needs right now
[Pre-Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she’s made of fire
Said she ain’t going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
[Chorus]
Don’t even know what she’ll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I’m hers in the blink of an eye
She don’t take no and i love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight, yeah
I get to be what she wants tonight, tonight

135,139,Her World Or MineMichael Ray,"[Verse 1]
One of us still has our picture taped up on the dash
One of us took that one from Mexico, threw it in the trash
One of us don't even notice when the radio plays that song
One of us breaks down and has to pull over whenever it comes on
Nah there ain't no in between, when it comes to her and me
[Chorus]
One of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine
[Verse 2]
There's a number on a phone that one of us erased
There's a ""late-night can we try again?"" call one of us wants to make
'Cause one of us can't even think about bein' in another's arms
And there's a car in the drive that stayed all night, where one of us used to park
[Chorus]
One of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine
[Bridge]
For a while we had forever in our hands
That's why one of us can't understand
[Chorus]
How one of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine
[Outro]
Yeah that's the difference between her world or mine

136,140,After A FewTravis Denning,"[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking
[Pre-Chorus]
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent
[Chorus]
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few
[Verse 2]
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss
[Pre Chorus 2]
We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time
[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few
[Bridge]
Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends
[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

137,141,I Hope You're Happy NowCarly Pearce,"[Verse 1]
It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said ""I don't love you"" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better
[Chorus]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now
[Verse 2]
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted
[Chorus]
Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now
[Chorus]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope you're happy now
[Outro]
Happy now
Oh, I hope you're happy now
Mmm

138,142,What You See Is What You GetLuke Combs,"[Verse 1]
I'm a puzzle
I'm a walking contradiction
And far from mint condition
'Cause there's pieces I can't find
Sometimes trouble
A can of Cope a day addiction
With set in stone convictions
And a no bend bottom line
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an easy read but I ain't no open book
Got a knack for making things harder than they look
[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
""What you see is what you get""
[Verse 2]
At least I'm honest
I don't spin it like a record
And I ain't acting like I'm better
Than you know I really am
Yeah, you're dead on it
You got me figured, I'll admit it
Set in my ways hard-headed
But hell, I do the best I can
[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
""What you see is what you get""
[Bridge]
With me ain't no tricks up these sleeves
An acquired taste, a constant work in progress
[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get

139,143,BlessingsFlorida Georgia Line,"[Verse 1]
First time I met you, knew I never could forget you, girl
You always saw the blue skies past the rain clouds in my eyes
There's music in your laughter from the floor up to the rafters
You're that happy ever after I've been after my whole life
[Chorus]
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say ""Amen""
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
[Verse 2]
Yesterday we celebrated our first year together
And together still feels better than that first night we met
I never dreamed that you could be so perfectly created, girl
He made a perfect angel
And he made you just for me
[Chorus]
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say ""Amen""
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
[Outro]
No, I can't count 'em on both hands
But honey, look here at this picture
I'd say we're a lucky fam
I'm thankful to be with you
A little house on a little land
Couple kids, two or three
Same old song that we'll always sing
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
Always take time to count your blessings

140,144,Better TogetherLuke Combs,"[Verse 1]
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove
[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
[Bridge]
Sometimes we're oil and water, but I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest, your first and my last name
[Chorus]
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here

141,145,Got What I GotJason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
She said, ""Baby, do you ever miss bein' alone?""
I said, ""Hell no, I don't""
She said, ""Do you really think I'm where you belong?""
I said, ""You know and I know...""
You're perfect for me
Everything I'll ever need
I ain't playin'
What I'm sayin'
[Chorus]
When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't
[Verse 2]
I said, ""Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy
When you're talkin' like that, girl?""
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I turned back
Before you came along
I could go all alone
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want

When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't

She said, ""Baby, do you ever miss bein' alone?""
I said, ""Hell no, I don't""

No, I don't
No, I don't

142,146,Cover Me UpMorgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun
You can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone
[Chorus 1]
So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
[Verse 2]
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along
[Chorus 2]
So girl, hang your dress out to dry
We ain't leaving this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
And the river runs through
And carries this house on the stones
Like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
[Chorus 1]
So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

143,147,All Is FoundKacey Musgraves,"[Verse 1]
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
All is found
When all is lost, then all is found
[Verse 2]
In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned
[Verse 3]
She will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?
[Verse 4]
Until the river's finally crossed
You'll never feel the solid ground
You had to get a little lost
On your way to being found
[Verse 5]
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
Where all is lost, then all is found
[Outro]
All is found
All is found

144,148,Drinking AloneCarrie Underwood,"[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 1]
Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'
[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2]
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should
[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone
[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home
[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Outro]
We should be drinking alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm a little bit a ball cap
Little bit a pearl snap button down shirt
Little bit a big city concrete
But a lot more small town dirt
[Pre-Chorus]
I can see your pretty eyes
Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am
And where I'm at
[Chorus]
I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between
[Verse 2]
I can be a steel toe work boot
40 hour blue collar, mud on my jeans
Then on weekend pack a bag
Disappear kick back on a white sand beach
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a far cry from being
A one night stand
But I ain't ready
For a ring on my hand
[Chorus]
I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between

Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am

146,150,For My DaughterKane Brown,"[Verse 1]
Someone to play catch with out in the backyard
To pick up the pieces of your first broken heart
Someone to say slow down when you turn sixteen
Yeah, I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be
[Verse 2]
Someone to scare the monsters, when it's dark in your room
Someone to put their foot down when you want a tattoo
And not just say I love you, but show you what it means
Yeah, I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be
[Chorus]
They say dads are supposed to shape you and in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself
Well, I guess that's up to me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be
[Verse 3]
Someone to let you fall down and teach you how to get back up
Teach you how to be sweet like mamma and how to be tough
Yeah, I'll never be perfect, but sure as those lines are pink
Yeah, I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be
[Chorus]
They say dads are supposed to shape you and in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself
Well, I guess that's up to me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be
Yeah, I can't change the past, but the past has sure changed me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

147,151,MonstersEric Church,"[Verse 1]
I killed my first monster when I was seven years old
He melted like butter in my bathroom's sixty-watt bulb
Kept a three-cell MagLite from Daddy's workshop drawer
Under my pillow and I'd pull it like a sword
[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed
[Verse 2]
The wolf hunts a hungry man and the devil a lonely heart
A minefield of bad decisions lay hidin' in the dark
Greed stalks, sickness steals, and pride lays a wicked trap
You can't avoid 'em all, no, you gotta trust me on that
[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, and make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed
[Verse 3]
Daddy, check my closet, leave on the bathroom light
I smile and say, ""All clear"" when I tuck him in for the night
But Daddy, I'm still scared, can I sleep with you instead?
I kneel down beside my little man and I bow my head
[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed
And I've learned that the monsters ain't underneath the bed

What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?
[Pre-Chorus]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask
[Chorus]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
[Verse 2]
What if the sky falls (sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down
[Chorus]
Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
[Verse 2]
By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar
[Pre-Chorus]
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?

Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend

And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
[Bridge]
You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say
We can still be friends
No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah
[Chorus]
That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you

151,155,Greatest Love StoryLANCO,"[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far
[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen
[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon
[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen
[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said
[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen
[Outro]
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me

Ooh, she got it all planned out

I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends for forever

Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats
[Chorus]

Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Same last name, same everything

You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah
[Verse 2]
You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch

Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow

155,159,YoursRussell Dickerson,"[Verse 1]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me
[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again
[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

156,160,When It Rains It PoursLuke Combs,"[Verse 1]
Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65
[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason
[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer

Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on savin' me

Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight

Catch me a 'round here buzz

Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
[Verse 2]
Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone

And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

That mango-rita you were drinkin’

That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true

That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I’m just getting old
Used to work, but now it don’t

A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don’t know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That’ll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song
[Verse 3]
I wish I didn’t know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn’t working

Eight years old, a couple cane poles
Sittin' down by the creek
Our lines in the water, watching those bobbers
Seeini that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot
Y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes
[Verse 2]
At sixteen it was twelve o three
Standin' at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight
But we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off
Interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes
[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes
[Verse 3]
At eighteen, turned my helmet in
And walked to the fifty-yard line
It's just the coach and me after we
Lost state, ten to nine
And I cried, ""Man next time to get in here
I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes?

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops

Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighty-six, my grandpa said
There's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round
We knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed
Lord, I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing

Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it

We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn’t do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history
[Chorus]
Yeah, we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we’d never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I’ll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they’ll remember
We were legends

Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever, Hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story

We didn’t do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me

I’ll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by

There ain’t another girl like you, another girl like you

Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you've got it all together
So if you don't mind, I'd like to know you better

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around
[Verse 2]
I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in Clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around
[Bridge]
Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been
[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around

I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now

And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

No rush, but if he ever singles you up

Boy, you're gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you're gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
But boy, you're gonna love 17
And boy, you'll do some stupid things
[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you well, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy
[Verse 2]
You're gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass

And a part of you will always be...my boy

And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy

And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two

You order a drink, it goes down smooth
Before you can blink, it turns into two
It was just gonna be another night with the boys
Shooting some pool, pickin' a stool and making some noise
Then she walks in and I never dance
Turns into tippin' the band, and taking her hand… ah man
[Chorus]
It happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Till the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that
It happens like that

I guess that's what you get
It's true what they say
As soon as you stop looking, it's right in front of your face
Cause there you were and there I was and here we are, I tell you what

True love, it happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes

Just one drink
Turns into one knee down with a diamond ring

One look and you never look back
It happens like that

It's a hard living, tail kicking
Trip that we're on, but I'm betting
We can find a little sunshine in the night
It's a back breaking, soul taking
Road we walk, so what are we waiting for
Baby let's turn off the lights
Cause girl there's just not enough love in the world

So we should make a little
Generate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little

It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more tonight

So don't tease me, it's so easy
To just turn off the TV and make some headlines of our own
Yeah girl, there's just not enough love in the world

You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?

Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down

Say you're 'bout to catch a cab over to my place
""See you in five,"" but, baby, this time

181,188,Found YouKane Brown,"[Verse 1]
I be sitting in the same old bar
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past
Runnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town
Had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't
[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found you
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I still go out sometimes
But I don't ever try to get that drunk
Now and I can't sleep it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets
All night keeping me up
Yeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me
[Chorus]
No, I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

And now I'm takin' back the way I said I wish I've never met
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better
I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found, never found you
No, I'd have never found you
"
182,189,New Year's DayTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but
[Chorus 1]
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
[Chorus 2]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
[Verse 3]
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
[Chorus 2]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

183,190,For The First TimeDarius Rucker,"[Verse 1]
You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars
Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark
You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same
Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change
[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
[Verse 2]
Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you
[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
[Bridge]
Now the way you're looking says you're living
I hope I ain't reading wrong
Cause the way you're shining I think you're thinking
It's been way too long
[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive
When was the last time, oh
You did something for the first time, girl?
Come on, baby
When was the last time, yeah
You did something for the first time?

Ain't gonna lie, I can count on both hands
My down to ride 'til the day I die friends
To get them, I'd like to think
That I'm few and far between
Guys like me, you want in an alley with ya
Up a creek, ain't a doubt I'm gonna paddle with ya
Go to bat, go to church, go to battle with ya
They can say what they want about me, but
[Chorus]
The ones that need me got me
The ones that doubt me can't stop me
Even the ones that said, “Forget him.”
You can bet they ain't forgot me
Either wanna hit me or hold me
Those that hate me don't know me
And the ones that don't trust anybody trust me
Yeah, the ones that like me love me

Speak my mind, don't mind who's listenin'
I'll ask forgiveness, 'fore I ask permission

And I ain't perfect, I'm a simple man
I got a sinner's mind, but I can fold my hands
I ain't afraid to pray and I do know who I am, yeah
[Chorus]
And the ones that need me got me
Ones that doubt me can't stop me
Even the ones that said, “Forget him.”
Bet your ass they ain't forgot me

And if you don't
Probably a pretty good chance I don't like you either

Where do we start?
How 'bout right here where we are?
You've been carryin' this weight around
Walk in the door and lay it down
Life goes fast
It's been a while, I have to ask
Where have you been? How did that feel?
Where are we now? 'Cause that's what's real, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the space and the time between us
Man, you should have seen us
This ain't no mystery
Our future is our history
[Chorus]
I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
[Verse 2]
What comes next
We don't know, we're not there yet
But I bet it's gonna shine
Brighter than all we left behind
[Pre-Chorus 2]
In a room in a blink and now it's
Like we never went a day without it
Pick it back up where we left off
This is liftoff (three... two... one)
[Chorus]
I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same

Ooh-ooh, watch it spinnin'
And ooh-ooh, jump right in an'
And ooh-ooh, let's begin
And we can see, don't have to be
A big step, just imagine
Take a breath, let it happen
When I hear you laugh
It sets me free, it sets me free
[Chorus]
I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same

To leave it better than how it came

186,193,Everything's Gonna Be AlrightDavid Lee Murphy,"[Verse 1]
She rattled the ice in my plastic cup
I said ""yes m'am"", fill her up
Tell me something good that I don't know
'Cause this world's been kicking my behind
Life ain't been a friend of mine
Lately I've been feeling kinda low
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And she looked back over her shoulder
Pointed at the sign hanging up on the wall
It said
[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hittin' that panic button
It ain't worth spilling your drink
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright
[Verse 2]
So I nodded my head and said, ""that's for sure""
Dropped a few bucks in the mason jar
Felt those good old neon vibes on me
And whatever monkey that was on my back
He jumped off just like that
Right into the deep blue sea
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I looked back over her shoulder
Thinking 'bout the sign hanging up on the wall
That said
[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hitting that panic button
It ain't near as bad as you think
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright
[Bridge]
There ain't no doubt it's gonna work out
Come on, sing it with me
There ain't no doubt it's gonna work out
Come on and sing it with me
[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hitting that panic button
It ain't near as bad as you think
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright (is gonna be alright), alright (is gonna be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright (is gonna be alright), alright (is gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright)
(Is gonna be alright, is gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright)

187,194,Get To YouMichael Ray,"[Verse 1]
Somebody had to hurt you bad
For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two
But that ain't me and you
So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

One day you're gonna love again
Mess up and let somebody in
To every part of your whole world

But somebody's gonna break those walls
Somebody's gonna watch you fall
Gonna give it your all and I hope that I'm around
When you finally find out why you

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough

No cover but the cover band was sounding right
But there you were
Just flirty dancing
By the neon sign
To fishing in the dark and
Reeling in my heart
And I look where you are

Hair falling in your eyes

189,196,When Someone Stops Loving YouLittle Big Town,"[Verse 1]
Still gotta walk into a crowded room
With the radio on
Crack a smile and crack a beer like it don't bother you
Like it ain't your song, that's on
[Pre-Chorus]
Still gotta cross the bridge to get to work
The one by her place
Make it through the 9 to 5 like it don't hurt
It goes that way
[Chorus]
When someone stops loving you
It don't make the evening news
It don't keep the sun from rising, the clock from winding
Your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you
[Verse 2]
Still gotta button up your collared shirt
The one she used to button down
Sleep on the mattress where her body left a curve
Or maybe just the couch
[Pre-Chorus]
Still gotta keep her number in your phone
In case she calls back
One night when she's drunk and all alone
Yeah you pray for that

When someone stops loving you
It don't make the evening news
It don't keep the sun from rising, the clock from winding
Your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you

There ain't a switch that you can flip
'Cause you can't stop loving them

Your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you

You and me can talk
About anything you want
As long as she ain't in it

Say, it's been at least a month
Since I've had any fun
Buddy, I'll admit it
Yeah, I'm into going out

Don't wanna hear her name
I don't wanna see her face, I swear
I know its gonna hurt

Down by the interstate
Out past the city limits
Hangout all night long
Hear a country song
As long as she ain't in it

Don't wanna hear her name
I don't wanna see her face, I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

Tried to move on, couldn't help to think of you
And I knew that you'd change everything

I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands

I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt

'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

You said ""I love you"" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you
[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us

So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my

Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
[Chorus]
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess

I lied when I said

I don't wanna close my eyes
Why pretend I'm going to sleep
When I know damn well I'm gonna keep lying here wide awake?
Waiting for the breath you take, to come back
I can't relax, I'm a tiger pacing in my cage
Cocked like a twelve guage
Feeling like a teenage crush, you're the rush
You're the habit that I can never get enough of

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

I, have the right to remain silent
But there ain't no way that I can
'Cause I'm wired like a ticking time bomb
It's so wrong, but it feels right
Tonight you repeating like an echo
Baby I can't let go, got me going klepto like a thief
Yeah I'd steal, just to keep on feeling what I feel

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes

Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose

It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal
[Bridge]
Oh, don't try to save me
Oh, you never gonna save me
[Chorus]
Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
What you do me is criminal, criminal

197,206,SwayDanielle Bradbery,"[Verse 1]
Hey, we're all in the same boat
Life can really suck sometimes
But hey, can't live in a shadow
So here's a little piece of advice
[Pre-Chorus]
Start by kicking off your shoes, leave 'em right by the door
Then you call a couple friends and you call a few more
Put a drink into your glass that will make you let go
Then you find something smooth on the radio
[Chorus]
That makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
Get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind
Put a smile on your face, sends you right into a daze
No there ain't nothin' wrong when a song comes on
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Hey, world's kinda messed up
We got no time for sittin' around
Waitin' for it to lit up
Let's break some rules and figure it out
[Pre-Chorus]
Start by kicking off your shoes, leave 'em right by the door
Then you call a couple friends and you call a few more
Put a drink into your glass that will make you let go
Then you find something smooth on the radio
[Chorus]
That makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
Get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind
Put a smile on your face, sends you right into a daze
No there ain't nothin' wrong when a song comes on
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh
[Bridge]
Start by kicking off your shoes
And you find something smooth
[Chorus]
Something that makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
Get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind
Put a smile on your face, sends you right into a daze
No there ain't nothin' wrong when a song comes on
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh

198,207,Heart BreakLady Antebellum,"[Verse 1]
I paint my lips red, I turn my own head
Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress
Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached
Sometimes the word alone, sounds like a sad song
But why's it gotta be, 'cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath, yeah
[Chorus]
I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break
[Verse 2]
It's just a little phase, give me a little space
You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face
Givin' love a rest, between my ex, and my next
[Chorus]
I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break
[Bridge]
Love, I'm over you (Love, I'm over you)
It's long overdue
I think it's time to take a heart break (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound)
I think it's time to take a heart break
[Chorus]
Oh, I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

199,208,Drunk GirlChris Janson,"[Verse 1]
Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow
In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows
She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home
She's bouncing like a pinball
Singing every word she never knew
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
Her hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home
[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home
[Verse 2]
You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that little bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did
[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how ya know the difference between a boy and man
You take a drunk girl home
[Chorus 2]
You took a drunk girl home
In the sober light of dawn
She left you a message she thanks you on the phone
'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor
You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home
You take a drunk girl home
Take a drunk girl home

200,209,Born To Love YouLANCO,"[Verse 1]
I was born in a town full of red pine trees
County sign says ""follow your dreams""
Westbound train makes the whole town shake
Friday night lights decide your fate
[Verse 2]
Born again in a church where the steeple's white
Preacher preach Book of John and my momma cried
Meaning of life was in verse 2
Didn't make sense 'til I found you
[Chorus]
I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you

I was a wild child between lost and found
Then you spoke my name, it was a sweet sound
Rescue kiss and you pulled me in
All my life baby, where you been

201,210,Kinda Don't CareJustin Moore,"[Verse 1]
I've been watching my weight
I've been trying to do right
I've been trying to get little more sleep at night
I've been working like a dog
I've been going to church
Yeah, I've been being so damn good, it hurts
[Chorus]
I kinda wanna lit up a couple of smokes
Kinda some Crown mixed in my coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowing in the morning, it ain't going no where
But tonight, I kinda don't care

No, I don't wanna think bout nothing at all
I don't wanna sit around here all night, wishing you'd call
I kinda wanna drown your memory
Kinda wanna raise my finger to all them used to be's

Yeah, I kinda wanna lit up a couple of smokes
Kinda some Crown mixed in my coke

202,211,Three Chords & The TruthChase Rice,"[Verse 1]
There's a Tennessee two-lane sky
Shakes the Broadway bars at night
Makes you wanna get a little too close
To a Cali girl watchin' windshield satellites
It's a soundtrack to our lives
It's the only reason why
A kid from Carolina would drive to Nashville
To chase a dream without a dime
[Chorus 1]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in the neon lights
Sweet Home Alabama and a Ring of Fire
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, ""Turn it up""
[Post-Chorus]
And for a second, we're bulletproof
We get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth
[Verse 2]
I see you blinkin' through your blue eyes
How a song can turn back time
You can almost feel the sand on your feet
From the passenger seat
Singing anything but mine
And don't you know that we were raised on the radio?
[Chorus 2]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in the neon lights
Copperhead Road and Mama tried
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, ""Turn it up""
[Post-Chorus]
And for a second, we're bulletproof
We get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth
[Bridge]
It's Muscle Shoals to rock n' roll
It's a steel guitar that steals your soul
It's a country song that takes you home again
[Chorus 3]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in church pew aisles
Amazing Grace, Sweet By and By
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, ""Turn it up""
[Post-Chorus]
And for a second we're bulletproof
Get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth

Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face

204,213,I Lived ItBlake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up
[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
[Verse 2]
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now
[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it
[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it

205,214,Kiss SomebodyMorgan Evans,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't goin' bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
Yea, we've all felt like that
If it's something that you gotta get over, but you just can't get over
[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
[Verse 2]
Sometimes you try to fix somebody
Just to find out they’ll never change
So you go out and meet somebody
That makes you feel the way you thought you’d never feel again
[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you’re wishin’ you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
Yeah (Yeah)

Oh, girl loses boy, the best remedy is
Girl meets boy, girl don’t make it harder than it has to be
Come and lay one on me
Hmm hmm
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
Yeah I know what you’re goin’ through, I do

So come on and kiss somebody
In the back of the cab or on the subway train
Come on and kiss somebody
On the midnight street in the summer rain
If you’re wishin’ you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closing time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close

‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
I wanna kiss somebody

Thanks for asking how I've been
I've gotten too good at hiding it
With an ""I'm okay"", ""things are great""
But the truth is
Yeah, the truth is

I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open

For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine

It was yesterday
It was years ago
We were singing every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs could save our souls
Somehow, someway
We was falling fast
We was jumping in
Blue jean halo hanging off the limb
Two American kids just like them
Every time they played
And it blew us away
[Chorus]
Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, and the music played
[Verse 2]
Yeah, we were never growing up and growing old
Breaking up or letting go
Girl's just like Rock-n-Roll
Where has it gone?
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holding on to 16 as long as you can
Every time that it comes on

Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?

Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane

Yeah, do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, let the memories take you back
Take you back
Take you back

212,223,Break Up In The EndCole Swindell,"[Verse 1]
I'd still walk in that bar a little drunk
I'd still ask you what you're drinking, what's your name
I'd still kiss you by the shuffleboard, last call at 2am
Even though we break up in the end
[Verse 2]
I'd introduce you to my mom and dad
Say ""I think I love her"" when you leave that room
I'd still not take their advice when I say you're moving in
Even though we break up in the end
[Chorus]
Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Oh, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end
[Verse 3]
I'd still play my favorite song in your car
Let you love me to it, 'til it felt like ours
Now all I hear is you in it, but I'd still let you ruin it
Even though we break up in the end
[Chorus]
Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Girl, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end
[Outro]
You've just had one too many tonight
You're just calling 'cause you're lonely, that's okay
But you know if you come over, I can't not let you in
Even though we'd break up in the end
I'd do it over and over, again and again
Even though we'd break up in the end

213,224,Coming HomeKeith Urban,"[Verse 1]
I wake up feeling, in my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete, harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive
[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta get it right, mmm
Get it right, mmm, mmm
[Chorus]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home
[Verse 2]
My mind's heavy and I can't sleep, not even a memory
Is good enough to get me through the night, mmm
I'm longin' for the real thing, people who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life
[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, I gotta get it right, ooh, yeah
Get it right, ooh, yeah
[Chorus]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home
[Bridge]
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same (Just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same (Just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same
[Chorus]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me (Oh, baby)
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like (Hey!)
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go (Yeah!)
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home
[Outro]
(Nothin' in the world)
I'm feeling lost in all the madness
(Nothin' in the world that feels like I'm)
I need somewhere to ease my mind
Coming home (Comin' home)
These sidewalks filled with different faces (Ooh-hoo)
So many places, but there's none like mine
Coming home

215,226,Hangin' OnChris Young,"[Verse 1]
I'm a few drinks in, but that ain't the reason
I'm all tongue-tied and my breath's leaving this fast
I can't get past
Those blue eyes shining
They keep drawing me in to you
Got me fallin' off track
You get me like that
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
[Verse 2]
It ain't the song, and it ain't the playlist
It's every smile coming off of your sweet lips, yeah
That makes me wanna stay here
No, this ain't a one night, one time thing
You always light me up like a flame and it's clear
Every time you're near

216,227,Hide The WineCarly Pearce,"[Verse 1]
I heard you were back in town
Well it's been a hot minute since me and you were hanging out
Yeah we had that crazy kind of chemistry
Where you get burned, don't learn, don't care
Just reach for another match and gasoline
[Pre-Chorus]
Knock knock, here you come a-knockin' on my door
But you're gonna have to wait on the porch
[Chorus]
Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on
(Lock 'em up, lock 'em up)
Turn up the lights
And kill the mood
Because baby I just don't trust myself with you
I better hide the wine
[Verse 2]
Well I know me and I know you
I better get rid of all the Two Buck Chuck
And the high-dollar good stuff too
'Cause baby if I don't, then you know what we'll do
One sip, one tip, we'll be sitting on the couch
You'll be kicking off your shoes
[Chorus]
Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on
(Lock 'em up, lock 'em up)
Turn up the lights
And kill the mood
Because baby I just don't trust myself with you
I better hide the wine
I better hide the wine, yeah

Knock knock here you come a-knockin' on my door
But you're gonna have to wait another minute on the porch
Oh no, no, it's a dangerous thing pouring alcohol on an old flame

Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on

Turn up the lights

217,228,I Hate Love SongsKelsea Ballerini,"[Verse 1]
I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped
[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
[Verse 2]
I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary (Whoops)
Oh, and I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something
But it sure as hell ain't butterflies
[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
Yeah
[Interlude]
I really do
[Bridge]
And I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it
""For worse or for better"" don't rhyme
They say I got the right one so now I should write one
But I'd rather just show you tonight
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
I hate love songs
The old and the new
I hate love songs
But I love you
"
218,229,Queens Don'tRaeLynn,"[Verse 1]
I wasn't raised in a castle
I grew up on the outskirts of town
No dresses with golden tassels
The rings on my hand are handed down
But I'm gonna find the one that needs me, sees me
And treats me like I'm already royalty
There ain't nothing priceless on my wrist
I might not fly private, but that don't mean I ain't a queen
[Chorus]
Queens don't hate, queens don't fight
Queens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queens ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queens don't
[Verse 2]
No, I don't need the tallest tower
To prove to anyone I ain't weak
I turn my pain into power
Every tear's a diamond on my cheek
[Chorus]
Queens don't hate, queen's don't fight
Queens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queens ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queens don't
[Bridge]
Queens don't break, they just get stronger
There ain't nothing they can't conquer
[Chorus]
Queens don't hate, queens don't fight
Queens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queens ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queens don't

219,230,Wild WestRunaway June,"[Verse 1]
Baby you could steal my heart like Jesse James
Come in, guns blazin', just like ol' John Wayne
Well now's your chance to save the girl
Better take it 'fore it's gone
Yeah you better get your boots on
[Chorus]
Love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Ride me off in the sunset
Outlaws makin a run for it
Well come on boy, be my cowboy
Keep me by your side all night
And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west
[Verse 2]
Wanna feel like we jumped a train to Santa Fe (desperados makin our getaway)
Like we're desperados makin' our getaway (like we jumped a train to Santa Fe)
I wanna hide away on some prairie
Underneath a blanket of stars
And just get lost in your arms
[Chorus]
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Ride me off in the sunset
Outlaws makin a run for it
Well come on boy, be my cowboy
Keep me by your side all night
And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west

Love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Love me like the wild, wild, wild west

And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Love me like the wild west

220,231,BabeSugarland,"[Verse 1]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?
[Chorus]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you ""babe""
[Verse 2]
What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, ""No one else"", how could you do this, babe?
[Chorus]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time
[Bridge]
Since you admitted it, I keep picturin'
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you
Babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?
[Chorus]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said I'm no one else, we ain't gettin' through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
This is the last time, this is the last time
You said no one else, this is the last time
I'll never call you babe

221,232,Get AlongKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, says ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain
[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along
[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?
[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along
[Bridge]
Find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to
[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

222,233,Cry PrettyCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is
[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty
[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river
[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty
[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty
[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah
[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh yeah, woo, woo
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah

223,234,Life ChangesThomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf
[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
[Verse 2]
I bought a ring and she said, ""I do""
But everybody else said, ""Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?""
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man
[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
[Verse 3]
I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
""You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen""
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?
[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

If I had a dollar every time that I swore you off
And a twenty every time that i picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin for when you're here then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all
[Chorus]
Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

If I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind
Well, I'd basically be sitting on a big ass pile of dimes
And all the times that you make my heart feel cheap
I might as well have won the lottery
All of this pain and me cursing your name
Would just turn into dollar signs

'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling

Drowning their problems in Bacardi
Same people still talking
Whoa, I'm so over it, I'm sorry
[Chorus]
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

You and me could
We can leave right now

Oh, I promise I didn't know he was your man
I would have noticed a gold wedding band
Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane

You pick the time and the place
Don't know how much this hurts
I gave him my heart to break
Now I know he broke yours first
Lyin' right there in my bed
While he was lying to you
Believing the words that he said
How could we be such fools?

And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you

But you're only cheating yourself
Choosing him over the truth

227,238,Hotel KeyOld Dominion,"[Verse 1]
Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were ""do not disturb""
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three
[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
[Verse 2]
Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no
[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah
[Bridge]
We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but
[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key, ooh
She kept the hotel key

""Thanks, Hannah, thanks for coming back""
[Verse 1]
The city’s so in style
All you see for miles are people spilling in and out of cars
Man, I love these bars are making a killin'
Everywhere I go looks like the place to be
I see people that I know and I feel like there’s no one here but me
[Chorus]
Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say ""hi""
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead
[Verse 2]
They're dancing in the strobes
Out here in the throws of loud house music
Everything’s a blur
I don’t hear the words, but lips are moving
Try to get involved, but I’ve 'bout had enough of people wall to the wall
And I’m just holdin' it up 'cause...
[Chorus]
Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say ""hi""
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead
[Bridge]
Free drinks, bright lights
What am I doing with my life?
Okay, I quit… I’ve had enough of this
'Cause people are losing their minds
Can’t get you out of my head
I’m calling it a night
I’m crawling back to your bed…
[Chorus]
Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say ""hi""
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red

Yeah, I hope the first question people ask me
Is ""How's your girl and how's your family?""

Want it to be because we made it
Another five years
Best thing I got is right here

Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em
That stuff that they've been selling
Ain't working like it should
But I damn sure wish it would
[Chorus]
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
[Verse 2]
Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and the sad old song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance

Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

Every bruise
There's not a song, not a sound in the world
We ain't made together
And it still moves me
The way that you move

Give me that old soul tonight

Some things get better the longer they weather

Than I was before

Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me

Twist top on a Sunkist soda

It's five plus five, not rocket science

It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would

I guess whoever said ""the grass is greener"" must've never seen the other side
And ""what don't kill you makes you stronger"" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that ""time heals everything and everything will be alright""
Whoever said ""it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new”
Must've never met you

Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say
""Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone""

Someday we're gonna look back on a night like tonight
The car I pulled up in, the necklace you're wearing won't even cross our minds
Someday we're gonna blink twice, say it happens like that
How much money we saved up for the time that we gave up
Well, it'll all just be math
[Chorus]
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score
[Verse 2]
If we're rich to somebody, we're poor to somebody else
We could be happy and nameless
Or broken and famous
But, from what I can tell
Is that it doesn't really matter
You can't take it with you when you go
Life is only getting faster (life is only getting faster)
So, baby, I'd rather take tonight nice and slow

'Cause I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score

242,254,Dad's Old NumberCole Swindell,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, ma'am, don't hang up
Nah, I ain't selling nothing
I don't know what I was thinking when I called
I guess I wasn't
Yeah, I was just down on my luck
Having some trouble with this ol' truck
And the guy that used to pick up
He could fix anything
[Chorus]
Sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number
[Verse 2]
I learned it by heart when I was 6
He never did change it
I've called it in trouble
With good and bad news
And break-ups, yeah, you name it
Sure, I've got some friends I can call
They're always there if I need to talk
But good as they are, it ain't their fault
Sometimes I just need him
[Chorus]
And sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number
[Bridge]
So I apologize in advance
'Cause there's a damn good chance
When I meet that girl
Get that job
And I need to tell my best friend
You're probably gonna hear from me again
[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
Yeah, you've got dad's old number

243,255,Heart Like A WheelEric Church,"[Verse 1]
She's caviar and mascara
I'm corduroy and leather
It'd take one hell of an imagination
To ever paint us together
[Verse 2]
Places I like to haunt at
She wouldn't be caught dead
Don't make sense to the neighbors, don't look good on paper
And sure don't make sense in my head
[Chorus]
But I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we'll roll
[Verse 3]
Can't say there won't be rough patches
Scratches from thorns and briars
Over or under, we'll roll like thunder
As long as there's tread on these tires
[Chorus]
I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll
[Bridge]
Ain't no map, ain't no way
Ain't no lights on this long highway
But I know the way by heart
Bring on the dark
Honey, don't worry
[Chorus]
Baby, I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll
I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we roll
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's go

244,256,All Of ItCole Swindell,"[Verse 1]
Little footprints in the dust on the dashboard
Radio still stuck on your station
Still taste your kiss from this mornin'
Girl you say there's another one waiting
Hope it's a long one, break of the dawn one
I want everyone you got
[Chorus]
Give me that ""Let's get out of here go jump in the river""
Girl, show me what that rockin' body looks like in the firelight
Wrap me up with all that love that you been holding back your whole life
Girl I wish you would just hit me with that
Pretty little get me through tomorrow smile

Anything and everything, baby you could never bring enough of it

Feel all your teardrops drippin' on me
The sad ones, the happy ones

245,257,From Now OnZac Brown Band,"[Verse 1]
I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble
What remains can only be what's true
If all was lost, it's more I've gained
'Cause it led me back to you
[Chorus]
And from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight, tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on
[Verse 2]
I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years, I chased their cheers
At the crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop and see you here
I remember who all this was for
[Chorus]
And from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
And from now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on, from now on
[Bridge]
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
[Chorus]
From now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
And from now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on, from now on
[Outro]
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
From now on, from now on, home again

Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's...
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway

247,259,May We AllFlorida Georgia Line,"[Verse 1]
May we all get to grow up in a red, white, and blue little town
Get a won't-start, hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much
[Chorus]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
[Verse 2]
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes
[Chorus]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
[Verse 3]
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one
[Outro]
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)

248,260,Wanna Be That SongBrett Eldredge,"[Verse 1]
The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spilled
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of ""Night Moves""
[Chorus]
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna
[Verse 2]
I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
(pourin' out your heart)
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home
[Chorus]
Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna
[Bridge]
When you're searching the horizon (searching the horizon)
When your eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack
[Chorus]
Oh I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
[Tag]
When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, oh, I wanna be,(wanna be,wanna be) yeah, oh

249,261,Better ManLittle Big Town,"[Verse 1]
I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around
You push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run
[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man
[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
You can’t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[Outro]
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
Better man

That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red
[Pre-Chorus]
Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it
[Chorus]
Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
""I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry""
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry
[Verse 2]
If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door

Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line

Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys, kicking it back
Or the guy with a guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can
Stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that
[Chorus]
And I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like, ""Ain’t she beautiful?""

You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl, no

It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room

And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like, ""Ain’t she beautiful?""
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'

And that's how I'll always be

One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'

Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house

Got a little dirt on my boots

Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor

That moon, that moon ain't gonna tell on me and you
Just say the word and we're gonna

Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
With that one stop light, no looking back
Wherever we're going, gotta get there fast

Hanging off your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest

257,269,Setting The World On FireKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
It’s easy to give in to your heart
When you’re drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were …
[Chorus]
Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire
[Verse 2]
Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said ""Do you think we’ll live forever?"" As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we were…
[Chorus]
Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire
[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, we were up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire
[Outro]
World all  on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
World all on fire

258,270,Kill A WordEric Church,"[Verse 1]
If I could kill a word and watch it die
I'd poison ""never,"" shoot goodbye
Beat ""regret"" when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound ""fear"" to a pile of sand
Choke ""lonely"" out with my bare hands
I'd hang ""hate"" so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word
[Verse 2]
I'd take ""brokeness"" out back
And break ""heartbreak,"" stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put ""upset"" down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of ""disgrace""
Lay ""over"" under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word
[Chorus]
Give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn ""lies"" and ""hate"" to ""love"" and ""truth""
If I could only kill a word
[Verse 3]
I'd knock out ""temptation""'s teeth
I'd sever ""evil,"" let it bleed
Then light up ""wicked,"" stand and watch it burn
I'd take ""vice"" and I'd take ""vile""
Tie 'em up there with ""hostile""
Hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
If I could only kill a word
[Chorus]
So give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn ""lies"" and ""hate"" to ""love"" and ""truth""
If I could only kill a word
If I could only kill a word

259,271,ParachuteChris Stapleton,"[Verse 1]
Street lights along the highway
Throwin' shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin'
To the rhythm of a broken heart
[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute
[Verse 2]
There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say
[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute
[Bridge]
If you think you're goin' down
Just know I will be around
[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute

Moves like a hula girl on the dash
She ain't made for practicality
Yeah, I guess she's just like me

It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll

Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying

So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me

I feel terrible, sunlight's hurting my eyes
So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
I feel miserable, and I'm missing you and me
'Nother Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets
[Chorus]
No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night
[Verse 2]
Besides the pain, I don't feel a thing
When my buddies call me up, I just let it ring

No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you

I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights

Tick tock, I'm on the clock and I'm feeling like
This job's just 9 to 5'ing my life away
It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class

Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, it's pay day

Double up and it's bound to get buck wild

They boarding up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay
[Chorus]
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
'Stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime

I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough

If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer (longer)
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach

Or bored to death in some waiting room

It just keeps falling and so do I
Well I'm feeling like the luckiest man alive

But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

Bring on tomorrow, right now the whole world is right

Than leaving here together
And in case you were wondering
You've never looked hotter
So why even bother
Looking at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to

And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more
Think a little less

When your friends start asking you
Look 'em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothing more
Tomorrow you can say we're just friends
But baby ‘til then
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress

Give you a minute or two
To say goodbye to your friends
Ain't gotta go home

Think a little less
And do the only thing we've been thinking ‘bout doing

Alright Ryan, thanks for, uh, agreeing to do this with me
Yup
Okay, uh, you be the girl, I'll be the boy
[Verse 1]
I really can't stay (Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will—sorry, I fucked up that one (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will—I fucked up that one too, I'm sorry (Listen to that fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
Well, maybe just a half a drink more (I'll put some records on while I'll pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
So, what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)
Wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this... spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurting my pride?)

I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside

The evening has been... (Oh, we're doing the whole thing?)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My mother will—fuck! (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are hypothetically delicious)
Well, maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
Been really... been (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

Where the corn grows, up to the roadside
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world

And her roots run deeper than that old town square

When she gives her love, she knows what it's worth

I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside
[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Fast
That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back
[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast
[Verse 2]
Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is
[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast
[Bridge]
Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause, I would somehow
But it don't work like that
[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast

274,287,My GirlDylan Scott,"[Verse 1]
She looks so pretty with no makeup on (With no makeup on)
You should hear her talking to her mama on the phone (To her mama on the phone)
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song (Eminem song)
That's my girl
Man, her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wishin’ you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl

Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank Him for my girl, yeah

Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene

275,288,There's A GirlTrent Harmon,"[Verse 1]
There's a girl somewhere in Tupelo
Who's with a guy she barely knows
Who will probably sell his soul for a kiss
There's a girl somewhere in Arkansas
Who's talking with a southern drawl
And a guy who can't stop staring at her lips
[Pre-Chorus]
And ain't it crazy
How they make us all so crazy?
[Chorus]
Why would we drive 600 miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
And learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
Cause there's a girl
Cause there's a girl
[Verse 2]
There's a girl somewhere with eyes so blue
You know a call it just won't do
So here I am on Highway 45
First girl to get me to ask myself
How I'd been with anyone else any other minute of my life?
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it something
How they get us doing something?
[Chorus]
Why would we drive 600 miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
And learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
Cause there's a girl
Cause there's a girl

Ain't it crazy
How they get us going crazy?

Why would we drive 600 miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made?
Get tattoos and wash our trucks?
Push and press our luck?
Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands and change our plans?
Lose our minds, break our hearts?
Learn to play guitar?
Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?

276,289,Any Ol' BarstoolJason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source
[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
[Verse 2]
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did
[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
[Bridge]
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby
[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool

277,290,Love TriangleRaeLynn,"[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the front step, little white suitcase
Hearing that diesel, 'fore it hit the front gate
His headlights burning down a Friday night
Southern belle statue standing in the screen door
Watching her whole world head for an old Ford
With a man that can't look her in the eye
[Pre-Chorus]
Then I'll run to him, big hug, jump in
And I cry for her out the window
[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle
[Verse 2]
Bowling alley burger, fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old two dollar matinee
Baby, how's your school been and how's your mom?
Patsy Cline echoes back off the dashboard
Starin' at my boots and the dusty old floorboard
Baby two weeks ain't really all that long
[Pre-Chorus]
Then I'll run to her
Wrap my arms around her skirt
And I cry for him out the window
[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle
In a love triangle, yeah
[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle Oh-oh
And some mamas and daddies ran out of love in '94
And some mamas and daddies don't even talk no more
And some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck and some of us grow up
In a love triangle

278,291,Holdin' HerChris Janson,"[Verse 1]
Well I've woke up in places that I couldn't remember
Who's lying next to me or even how I got there
That's hard to believe but that's how I used to roll
One Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time
Right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walking down a new road
[Chorus]
And when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when I'm holdin' her
[Verse 2]
On a park bench down on 4th Street
That's where I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
And tears filled my eyes as I slipped that ring on her hand
And then a few short years later God put into my world
A 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day let me tell you know
I became a brand new man... because
[Chorus]
When I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when I'm holdin' her

I am right at home
When I'm holdin' her

279,292,If I Told YouDarius Rucker,"[Verse 1]
What if I told you about my little nothing town?
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now
[Verse 2]
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
'Cause everybody's already tried
[Pre-Chorus]
Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually
[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
[Verse 3]
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them
[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do
[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
Oh, could you love me anyway?
[Bridge]
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to
[Outro]
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this is
I don't wanna let it slip away, oh, no, no, no
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway, ooh?
Could you love me anyway?

If your mind's as cluttered as your kitchen sink
If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
If all your white t-shirts have stains
If you've got some goods and got some ink
Well then, we should be friends
[Verse 2]
If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and momma's and Miller Lites
Well then, we should be friends
[Chorus]
I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains
[Verse 3]
If you paint your nails while you cut your loss
If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in
Well then, we should be friends
[Chorus]
I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains
One, two, three..

If you use alcohol as a sedative
And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get
Well then, oh, we should be friends

Well then, oh, we should be friends
Well then, oh, we can be friends

I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days
[Chorus]
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to

Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you're worth the heartbreak and the regret

But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet

Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning

282,296,Outskirts Of HeavenCraig Campbell,"[Verse 1]
My grandpa taught me about buck knifes and shot guns
How to cast an old Zebco
And how to work a stick shift
He taught me the bible about all twelve disciples
And he made sure that I know there's life after this
With pearly gates and streets of gold
He said if I just believe that's where I'll go
[Chorus]
Lord when I die I wanna live
On the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles
Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees
And blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
[Verse 2]
Now it says in the King James in the Almighty's kingdom
He mentions a mansion that he's built just for me
Now I'd gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage
And a back yard that's shaded and a squeaky front porch swing
That's where I wanna hang my wings
[Chorus]
When I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles
Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees
And blue skies and green grass forever
So Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah
[Outro]
Yeah, the good Lord knows me
He knows I need blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah, when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven

And I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you

Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's somethin' I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
[Verse 3]
I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane

Girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come to life

We shake these walls like an earthquake
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind comin' off your breath
The way you're callin' out my name
Makes me hard to contain

You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come to life

Everybody we know does
[Verse 1]
Not everybody throws their empties in a truck bed
Pours sweat off forty hours for a pay check
Take it to the bank at five save a nickel, spend a dime
On living it up
Not everybody knows an outskirts sky glow
Yell turn it up sing every word of friends in low
Not everybody likes a Friday night
Covered in dust but everybody we know does
[Chorus]
That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does

Not everybody understands how we make it
Hold it together when we feel like breakin'
Not everybody knows what we're made of but

Made you scared of love, too scared to love

293,308,Bar At The End Of The WorldKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
There's a trail of smoke coming out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers
[Pre-Chorus]
We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock
[Chorus]
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world
[Verse 2]
In that old seashell, you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash
And whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night, it's the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing
Called ""Make Me Disappear""
[Pre-Chorus]
We'll throw the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

They're playing Drift Away
That's where the magic happens
Back up in that little bay

Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales

In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street, heads turning all day when they see you with me
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

From the floor, to the roof, make the skyline spin

He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man
[Verse 2]
He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man
[Chorus]
My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man
[Verse 3]
Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boot of my old man

Hey, hey
Keep your chin up
Hey, hey
[Verse 1]
I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up?
How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles, then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough
[Chorus]
You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
[Verse 2]
What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other
That's what's up
[Chorus]
'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love, love, love, love, love (like there's no such thing)
You gotta love, love, love, love, love (as a broken heart)
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart

Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?

On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it

I missed the way he'd share with me
The things that he held true
While the lessons rolled around his 80 proof
All it took was...

Blame my name on my raisin'
Blame my lack of knowing better on public education
Blame smoke on the fire
Blame fire on the smoke
Blame the fight on the bouncer that couldn’t take a joke
But it ain’t my fault
[Chorus]
I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I’m only guilty of a damn good time
No it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault

304,320,Somethin' I'm Good AtBrett Eldredge,"[Intro]
Get ready to go crazy right here
Here we go
[Verse 1]
I'm a real bad liar, I'm a burnt toast kinda guy
And if I try to build a fire I'll burn the woods
I ain't a mover or a shaker, can't keep up with the pacer
Never met a dancefloor that ever did me any good
[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at
[Verse 2]
I got a poor sense of direction, sometimes too strong of affection
For a whiskey made in Lynchburg, Tennessee (That's right)
If there's a hole in my boat son, you bet that's all she wrote
I'm a Titanic sinking down into that deep blue sea
[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at
[Bridge 1]
Playin' hard to get are ya?
Let me tell ya a little more about ya, and why I love ya
[Verse 3]
Damn you're a looker
You're the cane, you're the sugar
Jiffy Pop in the cooker
You're the author of the book
That I'm reading (Ain't ya baby?)
You're the moon, you're the sky
You're the apple of my eye
Make me laugh 'til I cry
Till I think I'm gonna die
Turn me upside down
Spin me around
Spend all my money on you all over this town
[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that? (Would you look at that?)
I finally found somethin' I'm really good at
You thought it was over?
[Bridge 2]
Oh my mine
I'm such a lucky guy
You got me tongue tied
Like Jekyll and Hyde
I'm coming undone
I'm born to run
I got my shades on
Here comes the sun
All cotton pickin'
My tick tocks tickin'
I love I'm stricken'
I'm flip flop flippin'
I'm 'bout to cuss
Son of a bus
I can't stop singin'
I'm havin' way too much fun
[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm so good at
[Outro]
Hahaha
Cut!

One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know
[Chorus]
People say I got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all
[Post-Chorus]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
[Verse 2]
Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because
[Chorus]
People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Just a solution

It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all
[Post-Chorus 2]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Baby what's on your mind
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?

Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show
Or maybe just lay low?
I gotta know now

Out in the middle of nowhere now
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?

307,323,The Way I TalkMorgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
[Verse 2]
Yeah it's, ""Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now""
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
[Bridge]
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls

Well, I’ve been living like a wild ol’ mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might’a earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From going and rolling too far
Running and gunning a little too hard
So un-reigned, so untamed, yeah

Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land

Standing in that kitchen, it's been a long day at work

Whatever makes you happy, people

Happy people don't fail

And we all deserve to be happy while we're here

I woke up in Nashville
But it still felt like a dream
Like the one I've been chasing
Since the day I first played my dad's six string
[Pre-Chorus]
I loaded up the hand-me-down car
Went for broke, broke your heart
Didn't wanna but, girl, I thought I had to
But dreaming's just sleeping here without you
[Chorus]
So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up
[Verse 2]
I woke up in Nashville
'Cause those Broadway lights don't shine
The way that your eyes did
When they were staring back, right back in mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Been trying to live with only half of my heart
Just sleepwalking in the Tennessee dark
If I can't make every memory with you
Then dreaming's just sleeping here without you

So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up

In a cold sweat
And catching my breath
Dropping my pride
And dropping you a line
I don't know where you are
I don't know who you're with
I don't know what to say
But I'm saying it

Hello
I'm glad you picked up your phone

He praying to make it home
But you ain't answer your phone
Cause it's word on the street, them people didn't put him on
He got your name to 'em like several times
Trying to put you in a cell 'til you 75
Should've knew it when that nigga said ""I'm telling my mom""
Them people grabbed you and you wasn't surprised
What a nightmare
I'm having flashes about that corner selling, that right there
Cops riding past, '40 on me I got it right here
And I ain't trying to lose nigga
Play it by the rules nigga
When you get that money watch the way them bitches choose nigga
Fuck you like the pornstar, just don't lose your cool nigga
Pussy taste good, but it won't feed you like no food nigga
We was putting work in 'til we had to keep that tool with us
Took that shit to school with us (yeah, let me tell 'em)
Pulled up in my hood and I jump out the Wraith
Bust down, Patek, diamonds jump out the face
Fear of god on me, I got nothing but faith
Like where the love, I'm feeling nothing but hate
I'm from a hood where before you make it to the morgue niggas will come to your place
Day 1's all in your crib trying to touch in your safe
They shisty, got a nerve to even come to the wake
Seen your son and give him fuck if he ain't

She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins
She wants Aretha

She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying

She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind

We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long
[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way
[Outro]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

317,333,Tin ManMiranda Lambert,"[Verse 1]
Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Everytime you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart
Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo
[Verse 2]
Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me darling
You don't want a heart
Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo
[Verse 3]
Hey there Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart
Oo-oo
Oo-oo
Oo

The scent that you left on my pillow
The sound of your heartbeat with mine
The look in your eyes like a window
The taste of your kiss soaked in wine
[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

Guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me
But I don't want to sleep with him no more

Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

They say time is the only healer
God, I hope that isn't right
Cause right now I'd die to not remember
[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
I'm haunted by the memories of
Every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing

319,335,Heartache On The Dance FloorJon Pardi,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along
[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
[Verse 2]
So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along
[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about
[Bridge]
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know
[Chorus]
You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?

320,336,RootsZac Brown Band,"[Verse 1]
My first best friend was a 6 string
Took him with me everywhere I go
When I was 18, bought a Dodge van
Found a drummer and made the road my home
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today
[Chorus]
My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

Every Friday, you could find me
At Dixie Tavern, playin' with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end

It made the man I am today

My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from

Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreamin' one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night

Flyin' high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings

321,337,They Don't KnowJason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our lives
[Chorus]
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know
[Verse 2]
All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
Naw they don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
Livin' this way
[Chorus]
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know
No, they don't know

I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Oh, won't you let me take it back
[Verse 2]
I know I told you that I don't love you
And I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back
[Chorus]
Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong
[Bridge]
What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here, right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you

323,339,Last Time For EverythingBrad Paisley,"[Verse 1]
Using a fake ID at a college bar
Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything
[Verse 2]
Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
Or telling Supercuts, ""Let's leave it long in the back""
Wearing a tux in a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything
[Chorus]
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
'Cause there's a last time for everything
[Verse 3]
Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing ""Already Gone"" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything
[Chorus]
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything
[Verse 4]
Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything
[Verse 5/Outro]
Biscuits and gravy at your momma's house
(Last time for everything)
Spring break on a fold out couch
(Last time for everything)
Little Jimmy on the Opry stage
(Last time for everything)
Hearing Prince sing ""Purple Rain""
(Last time for everything)
(Last time for everything)

Got a baby in her belly and a baby on her hip
Little toe headed rascal peeing off the porch
Daddy got a shotgun looking for a stork
Oh lord

Bible by the bed and a bottle sitting pretty
Pigskin on the TV, bacon in a skillet
An ol' mutt in the yard lickin' on an itch
Bunch of fake flamingos flocking by the ditch
(Can I get a witness?!)
[Chorus]
And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
A yard full of chickens and a farm full of drunks

My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink

But I know better your memory's no quitter
And every time I do, I'm...

That ringtone can only mean
Your friends are gone
You're all alone
And you're thinkin' 'bout me
[Chorus]
I used to be your ""6 a.m
Hey good morning
Beautiful, how you been?""
I used to be a ""we just landed
Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend""
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice
When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice
So let it ring, let it ring all night long
'Cause I ain't your lonely call
[Verse 2]
It's been three weeks and two days
And twelve hours, but who's counting
Ten thousand tears, feels like a year
Looking for some peace, and I found it
'Cause boy you said, ""Let's take a break""
In the front seat of your Jeep
So if you got more to say
Leave a message at the beep
[Chorus]
I used to be your ""6 a.m
Hey good morning
Beautiful, how you been?""
I used to be a ""we just landed
Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend""
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice
When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice
So let it ring, let it ring all night long
'Cause I ain't your lonely call
I ain't your lonely call, call, oh
[Bridge]
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring

I used to be your ""6 a.m
Hey good morning

I ain't your lonely call
No, I ain't your lonely call
Yeah, yeah, yeah

335,354,Worth ItDanielle Bradbery,"[Verse 1]
Don't tell me I'm too hard to please
That you're worn down from fighting for me
A real man knows what he's signing up for
And if you don't then I'll show myself the door
[Chorus]
Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving
Cause I know I'm worth it

Is it too much to look me in the eye
And listen to what I'm saying this time
I'm so tired of being up on your shelf
And if that's what you want
You want somebody else

Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving
Cause I know I'm worth it
Cause I know I'm worth it (worth it)

Don't tell me I'm too hard to please

336,355,Die A Happy ManThomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm
[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm
[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace
[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man

337,356,Break Up In A Small TownSam Hunt,"[Spoken Verse 1]
I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...
[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
[Spoken Verse 2]
For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...
[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
[Bridge]
Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy!"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...
[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
They don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

338,357,Home Alone TonightLuke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
Some, make it 707
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top
And we'll go...
[Chorus]
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture

I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
""We ain't going home alone tonight""
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

Slow country from a cover band
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want, we could grab a cab

It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
(So, let's not let it end, let it end right here)
Girl, you're going home with me

Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other

I love my boots broke in, I love my camo hat
Don’t mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah I roll like that
I love driving my truck across the railroad track
If you hit it too quick, it’ll hit you right back
I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turns on
I love the sound of them wheels, my baby singing along
When “Boys Of Summer” comes on

Man I love this life
The sound of an ol’ dirt road road
Rolling through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man I love this life

I love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she’s been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time

I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol’ dirt road road

It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church, out on 109
It’s where I hit my knees and I thanked the Lord for this life of mine

I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol’ dirt road
Rolling through mind

341,360,Backroad SongGranger Smith,"[Verse 1]
Barbed wire fence carving out a hillside
Cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop, 33's just whistling by
Steer the wheel, one handed on a two lane, hugging that line
I got the windows down, no one else around singing
[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut
I got the windows down, way out of town singing…

Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on

I saw your picture in a paper
Honeymoon in Jamaica, she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux, from a ballcap in a pick up Seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man

Yeah there's an old you that I knew
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Backwoods on a four wheel, hanging on tight
I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band

I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself
[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
[Verse 2]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio

Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh

349,368,Gonna Know We Were HereJason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
You got the gas
I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild
You got the crazy
You know that's why I love you baby
Cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
Pedal to the metal, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life
[Chorus]
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here
[Verse 2]
People talk girl
You know damn well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give them something they ain't never seen
A little Rated R redneck dream
Let's blaze a trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride off into the sunset
Baby, cause we ain't dead yet, baby
[Chorus]
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
[Bridge]
We only get one chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby they're gonna remember our name
[Chorus]
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
No, we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here

350,369,ConfessionFlorida Georgia Line,"[Verse 1]
Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Driftin' like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cuttin' cross the sky
I'm rollin' through the open wide
Searchin' for a song to drink a beer to
And tryin' to find a place to disappear to
[Chorus]
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield lookin' back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
[Verse 2]
Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here tryin' to get 'em untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waitin' on a call from an angel
[Chorus]
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield lookin' back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Hope he's movin' in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

351,370,Nobody To BlameChris Stapleton,"[Verse 1]
She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
[Verse 2]
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
[Verse 3]
She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can't even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
[Verse 4]
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

352,371,Mr. MisunderstoodEric Church,"[Verse 1]
Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
[Verse 2]
Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard
And think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
[Chorus]
One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightnin' hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
They'll all wanna dance
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
[Verse 3]
First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
She was hotter than the Devil's hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers
Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
[Chorus]
Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
[Verse 4]
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points, sand my edges
And I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, I'm Mr. Misunderstood
[Chorus]
They're standing in line, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
And hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind
Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
[Verse 5]
Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
I'm Mr. Misunderstood (let's go out of here)

I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he ain't got nothing on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then locking the door yeah
Sounds like leaving you, oh
[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
[Verse 2]
Love the sound of the thunder rolling
Makes you move a little closer to me
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do

Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone
[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
And that don't sound like you
No, that don't sound like you
I know it's been a while, I don't mean to pry
But when I asked you if you're happy I didn't hear a smile
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
Because you don't sound like you any more

Guess he didn't like it so you just cut it

Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir

Until my sins wash away

Real men love women
Fast cars and livin’
Out on the edge so far
They’re gonna need forgivin’
Real men like football
Cowboys and outlaws
Can’t help but fly so high
It’s gonna hurt to fall
[Chorus]
Like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin’
Round and round and round they go
Cold beer and a dirty hand
Calling home every chance they can
To say I love you
They don’t need a reason
[Verse 2]
Real men love Jesus
And they love mama
If they can get more than forty hours
You know they gonna
They give it hell till they get it right
The kind every country girl’s tryin’ to find
Every girl’s daddy’s kinda guy
Ain’t scared to pray, ain’t scared to fight

They like Saturday nights out on the town
Sunday morning coming down
A pretty girl out on the dance floor spinnin’
Round and round and round they go

366,388,Night's On FireDavid Nail,"[Verse 1]
Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she's gonna be late
Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it's a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan
[Pre-Chorus]
You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day's gone and the night's on fire
[Chorus]
She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh, ooohh
[Verse 2]
She's a seat laid back, a boy's dream
Drawin' hearts in the window steam
She's a gettin' you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline
When you know what you're headed to
What's a red blooded boy to do
[Chorus]
She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh
She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh

367,390,It All Started With A BeerFrankie Ballard,"[Verse 1]
You had a Corona, I was drinking Bud Light
That jukebox singing every song just right that night
Something brewing in the air, and it was more than just smoke
Looking back, looking back after two you laughed at all my jokes
Tonight lets raise 'em up to where we ended up
[Chorus]
There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been some smiles then there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
[Verse 2]
I didn't have much money, but I covered them rounds
Cause a pretty girl like you makes a fella throw his money down
You weren’t shooting on whiskey, just shooting the shit
I paid the tab we walked out the door, I remember thinking this was it
Yeah, you were it
[Chorus]
There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer
[Bridge]
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
Here’s to you baby
So tonight lets raise ‘em up to where we ended up
[Chorus]
There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

368,392,Used To Love You SoberKane Brown,"[Verse 1]
Life was great, wouldn't change a thing
I had it all, but with you I had more
But out of nowhere, out of the blue
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling
[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober
[Verse 2]
I'm on the floor, cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know, I gotta let you go
So the liquor helps me forget
Your name, your face
This pain I can't erase
[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

Now you're gone
You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling...

Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

She said, ""Honey, do you think I'm smart?""
I said, ""Of course you are, ain't you lying here in my arms?""
She smiled, ""Well does this shirt make me look fat?""
I kinda leaned back and laughed
And I said, ""Honey, what kind of question is that?""
[Chorus 1]
You're crazy
There ain't a girl in this whole wide world
That could ever make me feel the way I do about you, baby
Yeah, you're crazy
But you can be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me
[Verse 2]
You can fuss about your hair
Say you ain't got no clothes to wear
But when you finally make up your mind
You go and change one more time
We can go out on Friday nights
A pretty girl could walk on by
If you really think I'd check her out
Come on, now
[Chorus 1]
You're crazy
There ain't a girl in this whole wide world
That could ever make me feel the way I do about you, baby
Yeah, you're crazy
But you can be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me
[Bridge]
And all my stubborn ways
Putting up with the messes I make
I even ruined our first day
Well, girl, for goodness sakes
[Chorus 2]
You gotta be crazy to ever let a boy like me call you ""baby""
I thank God every day  that you're my lady
Now that's a little crazy
So go on and be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me
Crazy over me

I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again, and
[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt

Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

I could tell by the way you sounded when you called
That I wasn't gonna like what you had to say

You know there's a light that glows by the front door

When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie

When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why

""I love you"" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie

Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine

And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind

I thought I knew you from somewhere
Right when you walked through the door
So, please forgive me for staring
It's driving me crazy where I’ve seen you before

Every cornfield and town in between
West to east

She don't laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing around her
She don't step on sidewalk seams
Teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She don't need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like a Tilt-A-Whirl
[Chorus]
I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl
[Verse 2]
The sunshine waits for her to wake up
She's a ponytail, no makeup, Saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in a summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane in blue jean pearls
[Chorus]
I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world

She turned around
And it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing that I could say was hey
And I'm so glad she didn't walk away
She dances like nobody sees her
Can't believe I get to be here in her world

I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street

Don't ask for much but I'd be lyin'
If I said I didn't want to give her
Everything that shines

A little time well wasted
Trying to figure out life
Trying to figure out girls
Trying to find our place
In this crazy old world
A little truth, a little frustration
Cold beer conversation

Man, don't you miss those Friday night lights?
Wouldn't you like to bust through that paper one more time?
Brother, my folks are gettin' up there in years

We could work a little less, catch a few more fish?
Yeah, maybe one day when we both strike it rich

With the neighbors saying ""Keep it down""
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out (You know what I'm sayin'?)

So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on

380,405,From The Ground UpDan + Shay,"[Verse 1]
Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love you’s
Me and you baby
We’ll walk in their footsteps
We’ll build our own family
One day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you
[Chorus 1]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
[Verse 2]
This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake
But I’ll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain
[Chorus 2]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
[Verse 3]
Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ this life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still
[Chorus 3]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up

Another new city, another new town
Making new memories
Making each moment count
My new favorite place is where I've never been
But there's one place I go back again and again and again
[Chorus]
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's been too long, way too long
So I'm coming home to you

Can't help but smile when the plane touches down
Knowing that I'll see a face in the crowd
We'll talk for hours and the world fades away
I live for these moments
My heart it counts down the days

Hold on, hold on, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's been too long, way too long
So I'm coming home to you

Always come home to you

All these days and nights
Quick goodbyes, crazy life
Everything changes but you

Way too long
So I'm coming home to you

We had a good run
But I knew, I knew, I knew
I knew this day would come
As bad as I want to
Ain't no way, not me girl
I ain't gonna stop you

Baby there's no way that I can go with you
So go on and chase it

And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby don’t move
Just say my name, stay right there
I’ll come running for you, yeah

383,409,Record YearEric Church,"[Verse 1]
Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year
[Verse 2]
I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year
[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
[Verse 3]
Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year
[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

384,410,Unlove YouJennifer Nettles,"[Verse 1]
I could break down and cry
Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why
This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried
[Chorus]
I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now
[Verse 2]
If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few
But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
This is going nowhere
If I'm with you I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight
[Bridge]
They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
With the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasn't lost until you found me
[Chorus]
And I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

With a bottle, layin’ in the bed
There was a little, a little bit left
So I picked it up, and I killed the rest

Oh I know I’m going to heaven
But I can’t go with me like this
I need to pull myself together before then
No, and I ain’t afraid of dyin’
But what scares me to death
Is meetin’ Jesus with whiskey on my breath

Broke all but one of my Lord’s ten
But Jesus died for all my sins
That’s how I know I’m gettin’ in

Girl, you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it
[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget
[Verse 2]
Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're get'in through
[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget (yeah)
Just what we came here to forget

Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through

Woah, woah
Wo-wooah, mmm
[Verse 1]
If I could make a living from walking in the woods
You can bet I'd be sitting pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheeling and dealing and sittin' there reeling 'em in
[Chorus]
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
[Verse 2]
I'd get a little Farm Pond bus
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke, mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

We get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way

I'm getting red dirt rich, Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee deep, in the Muckalee
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Lets go there in our mind

Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the morning, dark whiskey in the evening
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Come on

Won't you come along with me

The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town
[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good
[Chorus 1]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
[Verse 2]
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game
[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good
[Chorus 2]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loco's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time
[Bridge]
Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all
[Chorus 3]
When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time

391,417,Church BellsCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest
[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name
[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'
[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist
[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'
[Verse 3]
Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time
[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make noise

[Pre-Chorus]
You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground
[Chorus]
Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan
[Verse 2]
Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
Now it's happily ever never, I guess now I know better
[Pre-Chorus]
You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground
[Chorus]
Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan
[Bridge]
You're just a lost boy, yeah, I know who you are
And you don't know what you lost, boy, too busy chasing stars
[Chorus]
And you're always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
You're never grow up, yeah
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan
Never gonna be a man

396,423,Make You Miss MeSam Hunt,"[Verse 1]
You hear a new song, it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but
[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me
[Verse 2]
You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you've ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that
[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
[Bridge]
Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
I'll say baby you know all you can say
Is come and get me
[Outro]
Gonna make you miss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
And oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna make you miss me

397,424,Without A FightBrad Paisley,"[Verse 1]
There's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
A lack of sleep poundin' in my head
We both regret some of the things we said
But we love the way it ends
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sometimes I think
We hurt each other just because of where it'll lead
And sometimes I think
We're fighting just to be lovers and all so needlessly
[Chorus]
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight
[Verse 2]
They say don't go to bed angry, that's true
But it's really something when we do
(Madder you make me, the more I want you)
Girl, I admit
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sometimes I think
It couldn't be any better
(And I couldn't want you more)
And sometimes I think
We don't belong together
Confusing love and war
[Chorus]
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight
[Bridge]
We ain't givin' up without a fight
We can make up without a fight
(No, we ain't givin' up, we can make up)
[Outro]
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How 'bout maybe tonight
We make up
We make up without a fight

398,425,Go Ahead And Break My HeartBlake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
The sun is setting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when I'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon is rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, here I go
[Chorus]
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
[Verse 2]
I'd never ever meant to get so into you
Thought I was using you just to get me through
You know I'm broken, I don't trust anyone
Last thing I needed was to fall in love
You've got me dreaming, got me thinking, I've got some hope
There is nobody else I wanna get to know
But I'm so scared, I don't know what to do
How did you get me so into you?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, here I go
[Chorus]
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
[Bridge]
There's your reasons
There's your cards
What are you waiting for?
The one to break my heart
[Outro]
Yeah, you can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Oh, go on and break, go on and break my heart
Go on and break, go on and break my heart

399,427,Rock OnTucker Beathard,"[Verse 1]
Girl I really did mean it when I wished you the best
Good to hear you're killing it way out west
Finding your own way didn't take too long
Baby rock on, rock on
[Verse 2]
It's getting tough keeping up with where you are
Posting pics like some big Hollywood star
Guess every club in town is playing your song
Baby rock on, rock on
[Chorus]
Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I do a lotta thinking about wanting you back
But I don't know about all dolled up like that
If my homegrown country girl's long gone
Then baby rock on, rock on
[Chorus]
Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on
Yeah, rock on
[Bridge]
I saw your hashtag, digging on some new dude
Girl, you left me with nothing else to do
[Chorus 2]
Rock on like I don't miss you
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til I forget you, just like I wish I would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

Baby rock on
Yeah, I should've put a rock on
Yeah, baby rock on
Yeah, I really did mean it when I wished you the best

400,428,MaydayCam,"[Verse 1]
You are overbearing, I'm not in love
But I don't wanna tell you
We've been contemplating how to give it up
But I can't convince you
And we've been hopelessly holding too tight
When we don't even need to
And as the water fills this sinking ship
I know we have to leave too
[Chorus]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
I said I'm moving on, 'cause things were getting rough
But here I am in your bed
I strung it on too long, afraid to be alone
Now we're in over our heads
It's either sink or swim, we've tried so many times
For worse or for better
It tears my heart in two to leave it all behind
And say goodbye forever
[Chorus]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah

Oh, you gotta let me leave
Oh, the weight will make us sink
Oh, could you please help me leave?
Oh, abandon ship with me

Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday

Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)

401,429,Straight Outta Cold BeerBlake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
Just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls
Children of the corn field
Tryna turn a shift job into a dollar bill
We wear them muddy boots
Stay true to how we're raised
Ain't nothin' bout us fake

You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer

Just a bunch of John Deere junkies
Gettin' funky to some old Hank
Nothin' been stuck in the mud that we can't
Hook up to a rusty chain in the summer or in the rain
Yeah, it's a kind of thing

You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies

402,430,Fire AwayChris Stapleton,"[Verse 1]
Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say, is...

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more

Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave

Take your best shot
Show me what you got

Rear back and take aim
And fire away

403,432,Middle Of A MemoryCole Swindell,"[Verse 1]
Baby, it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we've been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone
[Chorus 1]
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
[Verse 2]
We were gonna dance 'till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark
[Chorus 1]
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me in the middle of a memory? yeah
[Bridge]
Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye
[Chorus 2]
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
But, girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
In the middle of a memory

404,433,21 SummerBrothers Osborne,"[Verse 1]
Now and then
I think about you now and then
When I see that Chevrolet
That certain shade, of blue
I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long
And even though its been so long it brings me back
Right back to you
[Chorus]
I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me
How you been I'd love to hear bout how you've been
You're the only broken heart I've ever had, and love to have again

I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder

Yeah you made a man of me

I had a couple beers with one of my friends
​Told him just how our story ends
​Did all I could to try to make it work
​But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

​Checkin' that calendar, x'in days off
​Hit another bar, call another friend
​Throw a few down, tell the story again

406,436,Southern LandTaylor Ray Holbrook,"[Chorus]
All my rowdy country friends around here
We like to meet at the hollar, build a fire, drink a beer
We slip out to the field, climb a tree, shoot a deer
I reminiscence about these days, man I get a chill
We keep our trucks lifted up so high
We kinda like 'em down into four-wheel drive
Sideways in a mud hole, that's just how it goes
'Round here, I'm talkin' 'bout the southern land
[Verse 1]
Grab a six-pack son, go hop in the back
Everybody 'round here know where the party's at
Down a real long road on private land
Passed down to me from my old man
Yeah, we get rowdy, crank it up too loud
Southern pride still makes me proud
Them long legs still drive me wild
When there's nowhere to go just drivin' 'round
Ain't nothin' like a sunset sittin' on down with a sun-kissed girl sittin' eyes on me
Take a picture for the moment so time will freeze
If you're lookin' for me, you'll know where I'll be
Beneath these hollars, hills, and trees
My kids gonna do that same 'ol thing
Same 'ol song, same guitar, just different strings
[Chorus]
All my rowdy country friends around here
We like to meet at the hollar, build a fire, drink a beer
We slip out to the field, climb a tree, shoot a deer
I reminiscence about these days, man I get a chill
We keep our trucks lifted up so high
We kinda like 'em down into four-wheel drive
Sideways in a mud hole, that's just how it goes
'Round here, I'm talkin' 'bout the southern land
[Verse 2]
You can take me out of the country, but you can't take it out of me
See these roots in my veins trying to do it different that any human eye can see (See)
How it was is how it is, ain't nothin' gonna change 'bout the way we live
I'm still runnin' around, that same old kid
Barefoot and all, just gained some years (Yup)
Let me tell you 'bout a backroad
Talk about the ones that we still ride on
In a little bitty town nothin' goin' around romance with the lights on
Back pew believer, I'm an underachiever
Just a good 'ol boy turned to a singer
[Chorus]
All my rowdy country friends around here
We like to meet at the hollar, build a fire, drink a beer
We slip out to the field, climb a tree, shoot a deer
I reminiscence about these days, man I get a chill
We keep our trucks lifted up so high
We gotta lock 'em down into four-wheel drive
Sideways in a mud hole, that's just how it goes
'Round here, I'm talkin' 'bout the southern land

I'm talkin' 'bout the southern land

Everybody said we wouldn’t make it baby
Love don’t live around here much lately
Times are hard and hearts break like the bank
Aw yes they do
Lots of reasons just to give it on up
Leave your soul on the shelf collecting dust
Live in a world of broken promises and empty tanks
Aw but look at us
[Chorus]
Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?
[Verse 2]
Put on a little old Keith Whitley
Back porch dancin’ singin’ with me
I’m no stranger to the rain, no, no we ain’t
Pour a little bit of homemade wine
Make some love, take our sweet time
Why the hell do we complain

Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back

Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?

Look at us we got a life out here
Outlaws, in-laws, coolers of beer
Spot on the wall to hang last year’s deer
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Red, white and blue flag hangin’
Kids in the back just a tire swingin’
Fireworks booming and banging
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?

Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream

Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

Hey, let’s party like we on vacation

410,441,Thy WillHillary Scott,"[Verse 1]
I’m so confused
I know I heard You loud and clear
So, I followed through
Somehow I ended up here
I don’t wanna think
I may never understand
That my broken heart is a part of Your plan
When I try to pray
All I’ve got is hurt and these four words
[Chorus 1]
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
[Verse 2]
I know You’re good
But this don’t feel good right now
And I know You think
Of things I could never think about
It’s hard to count it all joy
Distracted by the noise
Just trying to make sense
Of all Your promises
Sometimes I gotta stop
Remember that You’re God
And I am not
So
[Chorus 2]
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will
[Bridge]
I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
I know You hear me
I know You see me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
So
[Chorus]
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
[Outro]
I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord

411,442,Different For GirlsDierks Bentley,"[Verse 1]
She don't throw any t-shirt on and walk to a bar
She don't text her friends and say, ""I gotta get laid tonight.""
She don't say, ""It's okay, I never loved him anyway.""
She don't scroll through her phone just looking for a Band-Aid
[Chorus]
It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls
[Verse 2]
She don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She don't have the luxury to let herself go
(She won't call just to curse
Found a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough)
[Chorus]
It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing

A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls
[Bridge]
It's different for girls
Nobody said it was fair
When love disappears, they can't pretend it was never there
[Outro]
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough
So tough
It's different for girls
It's different for girls

412,443,She's Got A Way With WordsBlake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters
I shoulda known that when I met her
But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell, that's a class I got an F in
But now I understand perfectly
[Chorus]
She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (Hangover)

She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah, she’s got a way
She’s got a way with words
Yeah, she's got a way with words

Little words like ""I"" and ""do""
Lying, cheating, screwed
Yeah, all the words I thought I knew
They got a brand new meaning now

And your eyes are saying you wanna disappear
Well, I know a place and

Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky

I know somebody (I know somebody)

Don't need no black and white
He don't need no red carpet, cameras flashing in his eyes

And he's grounded in his roots
My baby looks so sexy out there
Working in his boots

Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice
[Verse 1]
All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice
[Chorus 1]
Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh
[Verse 2]
I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice
[Chorus 2]
Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice
[Verse 3]
Standing at the sink, not looking at the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mmm another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice

416,449,MoveLuke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you
[Chorus]
M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move
[Verse 2]
It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you
[Chorus]
M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
And I can't move when you move
[Bridge]
Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you

Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playing throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move

I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break
We were young and a little bit crazy enough to just think
We were gonna be something
Yeah weren't we something
A little bit burned, a little bit buzzed, didn't feel it
Still got the hat that you wore flip back, I wear it
Yeah I swear it

It was us against the world
And you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl

I still got the key to the room that we never slept in
Yeah the love we made you let it fade away, well I kept it

2000 acres of beans and cattle
But he don't ever get a rattle
He just goes 'til the sun goes down
Hydraulic fluid on his jeans
Red dye diesel and ten rows between
A cold one on the porch and a good night's sleep
Y'all hold 'em up with me now
[Chorus 1]
Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife that loves him every night
Raising a son or raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer
[Verse 2]
Subdivisions creeping on in
Neighborhood kids keep jumping his fence
He could double his money
But that'd be the end of a promise he'll never break
Cause he looked his daddy in the eye
And he's got that stubborn pride
He'll be here 'til the day he dies
No, he wouldn't have it any other way

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown

Just tell him how far he's gotta go and he'll go farther
Here's to the farmer
Here's to the farmer
Thank you, boys

California, by the sea
I could be livin’ in the lap of luxury like on TV
And that’s all good
But it’ll never make me feel the way I should

Be up on the stage with a reggae band
By tomorrow, with my baby
It won’t make me rich but it’ll save me

Make a little more love
Make a little less money
Catch a little more buzz, more buzz
Off a little less honey
Can’t have it made there in the shade
When you’re workin’ all the time
Make a little more love, more love
And be happy for the rest of your life
Be happy for the rest of your life

The sunrise, the front seat
I’ve got everything I need but I get it for free
Like the best things in life
I ain’t climbin’ up a ladder when I’d rather take a ride
Down a boulevard in an El Camino
Is it a car or a truck, hell if we know
But we’re goin’ and we don’t care
‘Cause the windows are down and it gets us where we can
[Chorus]
Make a little more love
Make a little less money
Catch a little more buzz, more buzz Off a little less honey
Can’t have it made there in the shade
When you’re workin’ all the time
Make a little more love, more love
And be happy for the rest of your life
Be happy for the rest of your life
[Bridge]
Won’t miss the dotted lines
Won’t miss the dollar signs
Don’t wait ‘till it’s too late
‘Cause you’ll only miss the time that you didn’t take
To make (ooohhhh) a little more love
Ain't gonna make it while the sun shining baby, come on
[Chorus]
Make a little more love
Make a little less money
Catch a little more buzz, more buzz Off a little less honey
Can’t have it made there in the shade
When you’re workin’ all the time
Make a little more love, more love
Oh, and be happy for the rest of your life (be happy)
Be happy for the rest of your life
Don't worry be happy
Be happy for the rest of your life
Make a little more love
Be happy for the rest of your life
Make a little more love
And be happy for the rest of your life

425,458,Long Live TonightLANCO,"[Verse 1]
Put your phone away
I know you want to check it
This is one of those nights
And I don't want to wreck it
With distractions and worries
'Bout what all could go wrong tomorrow
So live in this moment
And know that there's no time to borrow
[Chorus]
It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight
[Verse 2]
I know an old spot
It ain't that cool
But they got a little dance floor
We can act like fools
We'll ask the DJ to play every song from the 90s
We'll tear it up 'til the sun starts to rise and it's blinding
[Chorus]
It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight
[Bridge]
Long live, long live
Tonight, tonight
Long live, long live
Tonight, tonight
[Chorus]
It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight

Roll, won't you come roll with me
Slow, fast, full speed
Girl where ever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love
[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
With another voice calling me ""baby""
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo
[Verse 2]
Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep, I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream
Don't wanna be, cruisin' through this dream without you
[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me ""baby""
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up

427,461,Something In The WaterCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
He said, ""I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door""
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me
[Verse 2]
Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth
They said, ""Just a little faith, it'll all get better""
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm
[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger
[Chorus]
There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water
[Verse 3]
And well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight
[Verse 4]
Couldn't fight back the tears, so I fell on my knees
Saying, ""God, if you're there, come and rescue me.""
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm
[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger
[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water
[Bridge]
And now I'm singing along to Amazing Grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger
[Chorus]
There must be something in the water (Amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (How sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (That saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (Like me)
Oh, yeah
[Outro]
(I once was lost)
I am changed
Stronger

Was blind, but now I see

Alright
Make you wanna dance, don't it, baby?

I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on the corn hole game
If I'm lucky, yeah, I might get laid
The way that it's goin', the keg gon' be floatin'
[Chorus]
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more

Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on

Girl, you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can pet on my Harley

Stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feelin', we gone by this evenin'

All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more

If she was a drink
She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick
A chill and a burn all at the same time
[Pre-Chorus]
She's Sunday drive meets
High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane
[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm
[Verse 2]
I know how to make her laugh
Or blush, or mad at me
But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane
[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

She's the girl of a lifetime
A guy like me spends his whole life
Looking for, that girl right there's the perfect storm
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
She destroys me in that t-shirt

Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin’ me up, yeah
Buyin’ me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing
[Chorus]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home

I never thought you’d pick up the phone
It's Friday night, you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be sittin' at home all alone like me
Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time
[Chorus]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be

Got nowhere to go and all night to get there
But I'm going there with you
Tonight we're running on luck
If we're gonna use it all up
There's only one thing left to do
[Chorus]
Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

And this feels way too right
It'd been way too long to start
And it's sure worth drinking to

Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Break every rule we ever learned

One ticket to the big dance
You and me still holding on
Right down to the last song

Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired
[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind

I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Barely made it out of your drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warning from the blue lights
It's only going 9 o'clock but feels more like midnight

We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party

Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight

Girl you already got the window down
And you got your seat laid back
I ain't even made it halfway to town
And you're already talking about a 6 pack
Already got your shoes off
And you talking about slipping off
No we ain't even found your friends saying
You already wanna get lost

Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We're just getting warmed up

Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know

And it's getting kinda cold in these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day? (Yeah, baby)

Sure, I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped (Ha)
These days, it ain't easy bein' that
[Chorus]
Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
[Bridge]
(Yep, yep, yeah, baby)
Aw, naw, Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw, y'all, we ain't a cliché
That ain't no way to treat a lady
[Chorus]
Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend
Nothin' more (Woo)
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut, and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song (Yeah, baby)
[Outro]
I ain't your tan-legged Juliet!
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw, naw (Haha)

Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Another one horse town, another damned old rodeo
[Pre - Chorus]
I know this life is crazy
But I'll be home soon baby
[Chorus]
I'll ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
Like a cowboy
Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on
Like a cowboy
[Verse 2]
I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
It brings me luck, I need a bunch of that
This midnight winding road runs through my blood
I can't give it up, like I said I would
[Pre - Chorus ]
I know it's hard on you
But like I always do
[Chorus]
I'll ride in on a sunny day
Sing you a song, steal your heart away

Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild

Well baby you know I can't stay long
You wake up, I'll be gone
Until then I'll hold on

441,478,Lonely EyesChris Young,"[Verse 1]
Tuesday night, crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through that cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine
[Chorus]
Lonely eyes, well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something, whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes don't have to be alone tonight
[Verse 2]
They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let 'em go
From the little bit I've seen
They're the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way
Heaven help me, make 'em stay
[Chorus]
Lonely eyes, well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something, whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes don't have to be alone tonight
[Bridge]
Don't make me pay my tab, catch a cab
Go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
Gimme a sign, just a smile
Baby, I'll be glad to lose myself deep inside
Lonely eyes
[Chorus]
Lonely eyes, sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something, whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes don't have to be alone tonight
Lonely eyes, you don't have to be alone tonight

Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you’re the kinda girl that’s got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain’t nothing hotter
[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown
[Verse 2]
Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying “Son it’s on”
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song
[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

Ooh baby, baby, baby
You’re driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
I’m a long way away from where I’m from
But baby you feel like home

443,480,DirtFlorida Georgia Line,"[Intro]
I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day
[Verse 1]
You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...
[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
[Music Video Interlude 1]
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay
[Verse 2]
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...
[Chorus ]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
[Music Video Interlude 2]
I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said ""the world comes right to my window every day""... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)
[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains, you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
[Post-Chorus]
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
[Music Video Interlude 3]
See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

And some day, you'll return to it)

You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin', 'cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night
[Chorus]
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you

And light it up like it's our last chance

I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to
[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes
[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time
[Bridge]
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you
[Chorus 3]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

We all want what we ain't got
Our favorite doors are always locked
On a higher hill with a taller top
We all want what we ain't got
We ain't happy where we are
There's greener grass in the neighbors yard
A bigger house and a faster car
We ain't happy where we are

All I want is what I had
I'll trade it all just to get her back
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not
We all want what we ain't got

We all wish it didn't hurt
When you try your best and it doesn't work
And goodbye's such a painful word
We all wish it didn't hurt

All I want is what I had
I'll trade it all just to get her back
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not

You know a love like that ain't easily forgot

I don't care that you done me wrong
'Cause I've already moved on
I don't care what his name is
Girl, it is what it is
I won't waste a dime
Or the bartender's time
Trying to catch a buzz
Over the thought of us
[Chorus]
But I'll drink to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey

It don't matter what your friends say
They never liked me anyway
So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart

Cause I'm drinking to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'm raising my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey
Cheers to a good country song
To another long work week gone
And, yeah, I'm raising my glass to those savin' our ass overseas
I might stay for one more round
Hell, I might close this place down

You were whispering my name
Every star, every scar
Every mark upon my heart
Up and fades away
I feel myself missing
Everything I threw away
Every dream, every scene
Every song we'd ever sing
Got lost in yesterday

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight

Do you find yourself wondering
If I still think about you
Every thought, every step
Every tear and every breath
I swear I do
Yeah, that's all I ever do

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
I've been trying to do without you

The joke's on me and it ain't funny
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming
A mile away
I've heard it so many times I can tell it
To the T, believe me I could sell it
All day
It goes...
[Chorus]
A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar
[Verse 2]
I'd laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof
A cliché in a corner booth
Ain't nothing new

A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers

And a guy walks into a bar

River road, Chevy van, cherry classic coke can
Rolling on the floorboard; Fleetwood, Macklemore
Coming out the speakers, spilling on the t-shirts
Getting loud like I'm standing in the bleachers
Creek bank, tire swing, peeling off her blue jeans
Skinny deep sugar, fish a couple of new things

Hey, there ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high if the spirit moves ya, babe
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school, ABC style
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle
[Verse 2]
A summer jam mixtape, vodka in your lemonade
(Alright, alright) like McConaughey
White vinyl, gypsy revival
Traveling through the middle of the belt of the bible
Hula girl grass skirt shaking on the dashboard
Where we're going? We don't need no passport

Hey, there ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high if the spirit moves ya, babe

Oh, some of us like to watch and some like to dance
Though we all wake up with the same stamp on our hands
Counting stars and counting cars and just counting miles
Doing it freestyle, you style, me style
Ain't got nowhere to be, child

Hey, there ain't nothing wrong

Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah
Throw your hands up high if the spirit moves ya, babe

Oh, you can count it all, baby, one, two, three, child

Everybody chasing something, I don’t know why they’re running
I take my time to the finish line, cause we all end up with nothing

I don’t know why, know why
Everybody wanna die rich
Diamonds, champagne

Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
Never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch

Started my day, giving away
All of my baseball cards
It felt so good by the afternoon, I gave some guy my car
It ain’t about what you’re driving
Or about the gold you’re piling
The less I have to worry about
The more time I got for smiling

I don’t know why, know why
Everybody wanna die rich

She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her, you're just another guy

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way

You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart

So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is

Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey

When I’m with you I can see down the road girl
Not just the gravel one we’re travelin’ on girl
And I’m bettin’ that it’s gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that I’m gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin’
So baby let’s take it, take it

We ain't East, we ain't West
We ain't left, we ain't right
We ain't black, we ain't white
We just came here to drink
We're all mud flap suburbans
All ball caps and turbans
All prom queens and strippers
Where the whole kitchen sink and in here
We're the same, everyone knows your name
[Chorus]
We just raise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If you're a Democrat or Republican
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans
[Verse 2]
We ain't second ex wives
We ain't cowboys or redskins
We ain't preachers or kingpins
We're just having fun
We're all suits in blue collars
Short orders long hollers
Paper and plastic, too old and too young
Ceos, GEDs, DUIs, FBIs, PHDs
[Chorus]
And we raise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If your belly's too fat, or your wallet's too thin
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
All drunk Americans
[Verse 3]
We been in, we been out
We been cool, we been weird
Thank God we're still here
In the land of the free
And we all, singin' wrong
But we all sing along
Sing along

We just raise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If you're a democrat or republican
We're happy to be here and that you can see
We're just all drunk Americans

In these neon lights
We're all stars we're all straps
And we're all drunk Americans

[Verse 1]
I wanna drive until my cell phone
Runs out of range and every bar is gone
Cut through the woods another hundred miles
And disappear for a while
[Chorus]
I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low
[Verse 2]
I wanna end up nowhere on a map
A little cabin sitting so far back
Out in the country just the moon and stars
Are gonna know where we are
[Chorus]
I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Just lay low, slow it down
Girl, let's go... and get outta town!..
I wanna hear raindrops falling down
[Chorus]
I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low...

Oh just lay low
Just lay low...

So give me that aw yeah, and I'll give you that all night
Girl, give me that let's go, and I'll give you that good good time

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
[Outro]
Yeah, a once in a lifetime night
Ooh girl, looking down the ride of one hell of a night
I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

471,518,One Hell Of An AmenBrantley Gilbert,"[Verse 1]
Preacher said he died too young
Over there toting that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started praying
Yeah he went out 21 guns blazing
[Chorus]
And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled said bring it on
If you think I'm scared
You got it all wrong
A little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
Started praying
No, he never gave up
Said the Good Lord's waiting
[Chorus]
And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen
[Instrumental]
[Outro]
So be well my friend
Til' I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen
Amen
It's a Hell of an Amen

472,519,SpeakersSam Hunt,"[Verse 1]
I softly kiss your neck, and slowly whisper
You breathe in cause it feels cold where my lips were
T-shirt for a pillow, music up real low, creeping through the window
I can feel the bass line in the bed liner, and your heart on mine
Tryin' to jump up out of your chest
[Chorus]
Baby you're now on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
[Verse 2]
The moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
There's a feeling in your eyes the shadows can't erase
The cool wind that found us is breezing around us
Following my fingers through your hair
The engine is idling and girl this heat lightning is flashing
Pictures of you and burning them in my head
[Chorus]
And I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
[Bridge]
I'm tuned in to you, something's on your mind, ain't it?
Go on and tell me baby, don't act like you can't say it
I know your body language, you ain't gotta translate it
Let it talk to me, till I can't take it
Your lips, your hair, your smile, your touch, your kiss, your stare
Your vibes too much
It lights me up, you got me set
I'm way too gone, so baby let your eyes close
Say my name and watch me goin' up in flames
[Chorus]
Girl I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, where the wild things are
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods parked under the pines
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

473,520,FlyMaddie,"[Verse 1]
Baby blue staring in the window pane just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she’s got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress, now her heart’s a mess
Praying  she will find a way to make it
[Chorus]
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
[Verse 2]
Searching for a sign in the night, even like a lonely string of lights
That’ll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road’s been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There’s more to this than just the breath you’re breathing
[Chorus]
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
On The Way Down
[Bridge]
You won’t forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath
And fly
[Chorus]
Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Ohh-oh, oh-oh
Fly

474,521,This Kind Of TownJustin Moore,"[Verse 1]
In this kind of town people stay together
Nobody leaves unless they leave forever
But then again, they don't really leave
Cause deep down inside of me I know Heaven's got to be
This kind of town
In this kind of town we know how to fix it
We know how to make it, we know how to mix it
Friday night lasts all weekend long
We crank it up loud and sing a little song about
This kind of town
[Chorus]
We work hard, play hard
Take our paychecks straight to the Walmart
Girls will out drank you
Boys will out Hank you
Tie a yellow ribbon on a tree to say thank you
Sunday morning rolls around
We walk up the aisle and kneel down
We look around at all we've been given
And we thank God to be living in
This kind of town
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
[Verse 2]
In this kind of town there's peanuts in a bottle
The old men ramble at the brand new McDonald's
Talk about the war and the football team
Saying Lordy me I never thought I'd live to see this kind of town
[Chorus]
We work hard, play hard
Take our paychecks straight to the Walmart
Girls will out drank you
Boys will out Hank you
Tie a yellow ribbon on a tree to say thank you
Sunday morning rolls around
We walk up the aisle and kneel down
We look around at all we've been given
And we thank God to be living in
This kind of town

No it ain't everything but let me tell you, it's everything
In this kind of town people stay together
Nobody leaves unless they leave forever
But then again, they don't really leave
Cause deep down inside of me I know Heaven's got to be
This kind of town
This kind of town

475,523,Little Toy GunsCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'
[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
[Verse 2]
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise
[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
[Bridge]
Toy guns
Ohh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife (Like a knife)
I wish they didn't break you inside (Break you inside)
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah
[Chorus]
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Been gone too long, singing my songs on the road
Another town, one more show and I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door, and

Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall

I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls

Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins but we don't even care
Candles dripping on your body, baby this ain't truth or dare

Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again
[Chorus]
Why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasin' that desire
Sparks flyin' in her eyes like lighters (Like lighters)
Get a little higher (Get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (Sippin' on fire)

Every time you end up back with him
'Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feelin' when we're burnin' the midnight down again

Taking down your neighbor won't take you any higher
I burned my own damn finger poking someone else's fire
I've never gotten taller making someone else feel small
If you ain't got nothing nice to say, don't say nothing at all

Just ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Nobody's perfect, we've all lost and we've all lied
Most of us have cheated, the rest of us have tried
The holiest of holies even slip from time to time
We've all got dirty laundry hanging on the line

So ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Pouring salt in my sugar won't make yours any sweeter
Pissing in my yard ain't gonna make yours any greener

Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me, are we ever gonna stop?

The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party

But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

I ain’t rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day, ain’t working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can’t buy happiness
[Chorus]
But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat
[Verse 2]
They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool
[Chorus]
‘Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beer…
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting’ on a hundred mill…
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel…

I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling

It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong

Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you
[Verse 2]
When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy
[Verse 3]
I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothing
[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you, yeah
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Nothing like you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you
[Outro]
Never seen, never seen nothing like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Never seen nothin' like you

Damn girl, I didn't know you'd be here
Been a while, it's sure good to see you
Rollin' in here, ready to rock
Standin' there sippin' that shiner bock
We're pickin' up right where we left off last time
I'll drop a quarter in that jukebox
If you'll dance the way you know I like
In and out of that neon light
And if I kiss you up against the wall, it ain't my fault
[Chorus]
Cause I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now

And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on

You'll sing along like I'm the only one that's listening
You lit the fuse, now you've got all of my attention
Just let me know when you're ready to leave

Girl where's your hometown
Are those your momma's eyes

The long way home, home, home

Kick the dust up, c'mon
[Verse 1]
All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac
[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)
[Verse 2]
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people
[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)
[Bridge]
Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)
[Chorus 2]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up, up
Let’s kick the dust up

Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross off finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes

Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last

Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
Our neighbor had a pool

They play too loud and they're real bad

She got real problems, but we do too

It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name

The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days you're taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a fool proof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

You're the blessing and the curse
But I don’t ever wanna break this chain
I don’t ever wanna walk away
'Cause I ain't ever gonna find another lover
Who’ll make me feel this way
[Pre-Chorus]
Over and over and over, we say that we're through
But I come right back to you
[Chorus]
There's a long stretch of love coming down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll and baby, you’ll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love
[Verse 2]
You lift me up, you bring me down
You make me feel alive
You send my heart in overdrive
Every time you kill the lights
[Pre-Chorus]
Over and over and over, we play this game
Win or lose, we'll never change
[Chorus]
There's a long stretch of love coming down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll and baby, you’ll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love
[Bridge]
Long stretch of love, long stretch of love, long stretch of love
Over and over and over, we play this game
Win or lose, we'll never change
[Chorus]
There's a long stretch of love coming down the line
I'm your rock that won’t ever roll and baby, you’ll be mine
I'll be right here beside you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love (Oh baby)

I don’t wanna break this chain
I ain't gonna walk away
In this long stretch of love

503,561,Smokin' And DrinkinMiranda Lambert,"[Verse 1]
It was one of those times what a real good time felt like a long time ago
It was one of those fires that burned all night and made your blue jeans smell like smoke
Hanging with friends, going against our upbringing, smokin' and drinkin'
It was one of those girls and one of those guys who didn't know quite what to do
We were going along with what was going on saying I think I love you
And I think about us now every time that I go out, smokin' and drinkin'
[Chorus]
Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gotcha' thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'
[Verse 2]
We be lighting up saying this town sucks so we painted on the bridge
We were young in love to not know enough that those were the days that we were going to miss
But damn we know it now cause that's all we talk about, smokin' and drinkin'
[Chorus]
Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gotcha' thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'
Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gotcha' thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'
[Bridge]
Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' got cha thinkin about the one that got away

Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
Smokin' and drinkin'

Laying with my lady on the riverbank
She looked over lazy, and she gave me a wink
She said: ""there's no sense a working if it's this dang hot""
So dip your toes in the water, baby this is the spot

Well it feels good, good, good

Had 'em all dressed in their Sunday best calling me dirty words
Had a few drive by shootin' me the bird
Night-stalking me, callin', my phone blowing up
Going all Carrie Underwood on my truck
[Verse 2]
They get crazy and mean
And everything in-between
You can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself
[Chorus]
Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild, and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you
[Verse 3]
Had 'em burn my clothes in a barrel in the front yard
Revenging and binging up my credit cards
Post pictures of me naked with my ink showing through
In the places no one knew there were tattoos

Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through

Ain't nothing she can't see through

Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new

506,564,CountryMo Pitney,"[Verse 1]
Have you ever picked guitar on your front porch
In the morning as the sun was rising?
Or followed your dog down to the river
And ran into an ole’ baptizing?
Do you think to pull off on the side of the road
When that big black hearse is passing?
Have you ever helped someone in need
Without them even asking?
We do that in the country
Let me tell you about country
[Chorus]
Country can be in the middle of a city
Country can be on a farm
Country ain’t even a place on the map
It’s a place in your heart
[Bridge]
Would you ever hitch a ride to Music City
Just to see an Opry show?
Would you drive across the country
Just to listen to some country?
[Chorus 2]
Country can be in the middle of a city
Country can be in a barn
Country ain’t even a place on the map
It’s a place in your heart
[Verse 2]
Have you ever been there at the courthouse square
For the parade on the Fourth of July?
With a tear on your face, and a lump in your throat
As you watch ole’ glory go by
Or sat through a service where they played taps
For a soldier who never came home?
Or looked in the sad brown eyes of his momma
As she touched his name on that stone?
He fought for his country
And died for his country
Yeah, I love my country

Let me tell you about country

Well, I didn't know me, like I know me now
Sometimes you gotta get lost so you can get found
I've been scared of the dark
I've been scared of the light
But if you never get knocked down, you'll never learn how to fight
[Verse 2]
Imagine all of the dreams you're too scared to chase
You spend every last tomorrow looking back on yesterday
I've been where you are so many times before
These are moments when you find what you've been living for

This is when you get up
This is where it all begins
This is where it hurts
This is when you learn that
This is where it all begins
Where it all begins

My Momma used to say when I was just a child
""Life's little ups and downs make it all worth the while""
Oh don't worry 'bout nobody cause nobody's keeping score
Yeah, your hardest days are a part of something so much more

This is where you fall
This is when you get up
This is where it all begins
This is where it hurts
This is when you learn that
This is where it all begins

Starting over is a beautiful thing
You find out who you are through the pain

Let me run my fingers down your back

Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we’ll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It’s time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’ these two hands
Until they’re holding you again

When it was an old back road with an old school beat

In a run-down kitchen
When you're never takin' nothin' and doin' nothin' but givin'
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

If you met her, man believe me
You'd want her to stay a while
She says, she don't believe in strangers
Only sinners with a savior
Cause her mom and daddy raised her

You can love her, you can hate her
But you're never going to change her
If you want her then you'll take her

Girl, don't hang up
I called on purpose
Yeah, I've had a few
Hell, I'm hurting
Our song came on the radio
I could hear you singing along
So I took the long way home
So I could listen to it all
[Chorus 1]
Sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This ain't no drunk dial
Ain't no words that I'm forgetting
In the morning
Still mean everything I said
I know it's late and I ain't called in awhile
But this ain't no drunk dial
[Verse 2]
We ain't got to talk about what happened
But I'll take the blame
If you want me to have it
Somewhere in this full moon night
There's a way to make this whole thing right
If you leave the front door open
I'll be there before you know it
[Chorus 2]
This ain't no drunk dial
Ain't no words that I'll forget
In the morning
Still mean everything I said
I know it's late
And I ain't called in a while
But this ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial

This ain't courage from a bottle
It's just one last shot to give it all we got, yeah

519,583,StayFlorida Georgia Line,"[Verse 1]
I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith
[Chorus]
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(Girl, you gotta know I love you)
[Verse 2]
My heart's on my sleeve, but it's turning black
(I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone)
Without your touch, I'm not gonna last
(I know you know that I need you just to carry on)
It feels like my walls are caving in
(You always wanted it more, I left you hangin' on)
And I'll do anything to have you here again
[Chorus]
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
[Verse 3]
Yeah, the days are cold, the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you, and make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
'Cause goin' on without you is killing me everyday
[Chorus]
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(Girl, you gotta know I love you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?

When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home
[Chorus]
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
[Verse 2]
Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long my friend
'till we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to...

I got a little drunk last night
There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain
I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night
[Pre-Chorus]
Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

I got a little too far gone
Heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down

I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
Laying down on the bathroom floor
My loneliness was rattling the windows
You said you don't want me anymore
[Chorus]
And you left me standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
'Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through, wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you

You ain't worth another sleepless night
And I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind

Feeling like a fool for trying

Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can't stay this high forever
This man has had all he can stand, time to lay this body down

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?

And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me

Sweet Annie
I know I promised you a life
But with an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and I'd pray it's not too late

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?

Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again

Can I stay with you a while?

Waiting on you to look my way and scoot

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country right hip-hop mixtape

Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight

Told the bartender pour her a shot and make it strong
Because she needed cheering up
She proceeded to get drunk
You could see it tearing up in her eyes

Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go
Four bald tires, with the ceiling fallin' and the window stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio
We'd turn it on, turn it up to ten, and everybody would jump on in
[Chorus]
Riding down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
Like a feel real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio
[Verse 2]
I'd grab my girl, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars
The perfect place to put it in park and take it slow
She'd sing along, to even the ones that she barely knew
She still sounded good, a little out of tune, but we didn't care
I'd look at her, she'd look at me, I'll never forget that melody

Shhh, hey y'all be quiet
That's my favorite song
Hey man turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on

Low-beam lights
God I miss when, you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin' bout you every time it came on

When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling

I could roll on through without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us
[Verse 4]
Every beat, every line, every word, every single time
I just close my eyes and you're ridin' shotgun
You and me, baby, on the run
I miss you baby
I miss you baby

Alright
[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's been a bumpy road
Roller coasters high and low
Fill the tank and drive the car
Pedal fast, pedal hard
You won't have to go that far
[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna give up 'cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart
[Chorus]
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
Never be alone (Oh-oh)
Never be alone (Oh-oh)

Forgot directions on your way
Don't close your eyes, don't be afraid
We might be crazy late at night
I can't wait 'til you arrive
Follow stars; you'll be alright

You wanna give up 'cause it's dark (Hey)
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go

'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
Never be alone (Oh-oh)
Never be alone (Oh-oh)

You wanna give up 'cause it's dark (Dark, dark, dark)
We're really not that far apart

534,601,Helluva LifeFrankie Ballard,"[Verse 1]
Saturday night and a six pack, girl
Big star shining on a small town world
It's a helluva life, it's a helluva life
And KC lights on a dirt road dance
You take that kiss just as far as you can
It's a helluva life, oh it's a helluva life
[Chorus]
And pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin'
To a song that's playing on the radio station
Bad times make the good times better
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever
On a helluva ride
Yeah, it's a helluva life
It's a helluva life
[Verse 2]
And we all have faith, and we all have hope
But we're all a little lost in the same damn boat
It's a helluva life, yeah it's a helluva life
Something 'bout the night girl
When you got the right girl
Sitting right beside you
Looking at the sky, girl
Thinking 'bout why we're here
And where we're going
Baby, here we are
And all I know is
[Chorus]
Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin'
To a song that's playing, the world starts fadin'
Bad times make the good times better
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever
On a helluva ride
Yeah, it's a helluva life
It's a helluva life

Something 'bout the night, girl
When you got the right, girl
Sitting right beside you
Looking at the sky, girl
Thinking 'bout why we're here
And where we're going
Baby, here we are
And all I know is

Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars
Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin'
To a song that's playing, it's the perfect combination
Bad times make the good times better
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever
On a heavenly ride
Yeah, it's a helluva life
It's a helluva life
[Outro]
Bad times make the good times better
Aw, one helluva life
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever

I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me's on their honeymoon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me

537,604,I Hold OnDierks Bentley,"[Verse 1]
It's just an old beat up truck
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don’t understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn’t trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don’t know is my dad and me–
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she’s still here and now he’s gone
So I hold on
[Verse 2]
It's just an old beat up box
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don’t look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood
Yeah, that’s what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on
[Chorus]
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on
[Verse 3]
Yeah, baby, looking at you right now
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah, let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me, baby?
I hold on
Yeah
I hold on…

To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong

Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on

Now I ain't sayin' them LA ladies don't know what they're doing

I had some Seattle coffee, some Chicago wind
Some Kansas sweet fields I'd love to see again
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow
And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans

Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her tires in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes cherries in her coke, takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

If you've ever seen Savannah heat up when the stars come out
Well, then, fellas, come on, you know what I'm talking about

Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world

Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls

Where it all began

Nothin' to do

Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of

Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music
[Verse 2]
I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause
[Chorus]
You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
We're falling in love to the  beat of the music
To the  beat of the music

548,617,Young LoveKip Moore,"[Verse 1]
Your daddy thought I was wrong for you
Thinking back your mom did too
But two wrongs never felt so right
It was written in the stars
For two young and wild at hearts
To sneak out late into the night
[Pre- Chorus]
You'd climb in and take my hand
And you slide on over, on over and we'd ride
[Chorus]
'Cause young love don't know nothin'
When the radio plays you sing along
When she's holdin' on
You just can't get close enough
You swear it's sent from above
It's real, it's good, and it's young love
[Verse 2]
Remember that time you were supposed to be
At your friend Kate's and not with me
In Panama City a hundred miles away
And that damned old truck of mine broke down
Your old man cussed me out
And swore that's the last I'd see your face
[Pre - Chorus]
But I'd pull into your neighbor's drive and cut the lights
And you slide on over, on over and we'd ride
[Chorus]
'Cause young love don't know nothin'
When the radio plays you sing along
When she's holdin' on
You just can't get close enough
You swear it's sent from above
It's real, it's good, and it's young love
Oh, yeah
[Pre - Chorus]
There was really no way of knowing
But look at us, baby, we're still going
[Chorus]
Young love don't know nothin'
When the radio plays you sing along
All damn night long
You just can't get close enough
You swear it's sent from above
It's real, it's good, and it's still young love
Young love
Oh, yeah

549,618,Follow Your ArrowKacey Musgraves,"[Verse 1]
If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one
[Verse 2]
If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatever you want
[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points
[Verse 3]
If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a...
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em don't mean you should join 'em
[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points
[Bridge]
Say what you think, love who you love
'Cause you just get so many trips around the sun
Yeah, you only...
Only live once
[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

I hear you're out there now and you're doing alright
A new lease on life in Hollywood
Riding around with the ragtop down
Bet the west coast sun looks good on you
Wasn't very long ago we were sitting
On a lost dirt road by the railroad tracks
If you ever think about that
And wonder where I'm at and wanna come back
[Chorus]
I'm sitting on a tailgate in the middle of a stargaze
Wishing you were in my arms
Chilling right here, baby if you want it
I've got a cold beer with your name on it
Back 40 on a Friday night
Me and you dancing in the firelight
Girl you gotta admit it sounds pretty good, don't it?
I've got a cold beer with your name on it
[Verse 2]
Pop the top, kick back like we used to do
Sipping all night long to your favorite tunes
If you ever get tired of the concrete life
Those honking horns, them flashing lights
Got a jar of shine if you need it
Under the seat, you know where I keep it
Hey girl turn off your cell phone
Put your blue jeans on, get back home

[Bridge]
Cooler loaded down, picture perfect view
All that's missing now is… you

Out here baby you just never know
Yeah, these are the days of gold

Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold

A little bit of you, a little bit of me
What you want to do, what's it going to be
We can get a wild, we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine
Slice the watermelon and you spit the seed
Sweat on your back's sticking to the seat
We can sneak off to beat the heat
I'll be buzzing on you honey like a bumble bee

Well it's a Southern summer
Whiskey's in the air, dogs' on the burner
Beer's ice cold, got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer
And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar

556,628,Play It AgainLuke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
[Chorus]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up
[Chorus 2]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
[Bridge]
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar
[Chorus 3]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

Now there are men who make history
There are men who change the world
And there are men like me
That simply find the right girl
And in that very moment, it all becomes clear
What I’m meant to do, the reason I’m here
Now every night I thank the Lord I found you
And every time I put my arms around you
[Chorus]
I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do
[Verse 2]
It never fails, we walk in a room
Nobody sees me, they’re all looking at you
I disappear but that’s fine with me
I feel the same way, you’re all I can see
Now they’ve written books about da Vinci’s muse
Now I know it wasn’t but it shoulda been you
[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do
[Verse 3]
Why don’t we run off to Paris while we’re still young
We could drink a little wine, have a little fun
I could tell you I love you in a foreign tongue
We could work on our French in more ways than one
I could take your hand, we could walk in the Louvre
I could show them real beauty, let them get a load of you
[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like the frame that gets to hold the Mona Lisa
And I don’t care if that’s all I ever do

And live my life a little on the rocks
Laugh at every time I fail
Not afraid to make a fool of myself
And keep on dancing when the music stops
[Chorus]
Because I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high, leaning on your shoulder
Sweeter like a wine as it gets older
When I die I don't want to go sober
Oh, when I die, I don't want to go sober
[Verse 2]
You're like drinking from a never-ending bottle
When I think it's gone there's always a little more left
Lay back with you and close my eyes
Let the big old world just spin on by
And saying your name with my last breath

Oh, when I die, I don't want to go sober
Oh, when I die, I don't want to go sober

Sit here and drink a few
Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown

These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be

She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doing what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doing what she likes
[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes
[Verse 2]
She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doing what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doing what she likes
[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes
[Bridge]
She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwing words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doing what she likes
Doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my

Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

Hope you get lonely
Hope you get lonely tonight
Girl
[Chorus]
If you're feelin' what I'm feelin' let's mix it up
You got my number baby hit me up
If you need a little late night pick me up
I, hope you get lonely tonight
We ain't gotta make up, just kiss me
We could straight up blame it on the whiskey
You ain't gotta wake up and miss me, no
I hope you get lonely tonight
[Outro]
Lonely tonight
Lonely tonight
Yep girl, I hope you get lonely tonight

564,638,Cop CarKeith Urban,"[Verse 1]
We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh
[Pre-Chorus]
Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy
[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
[Verse 2]
Man, they weren't playing
They sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it
But I did
You were on the left
I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door
[Pre-Chorus]
I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy
[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Ohh, and you were like
[Bridge]
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone
[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
[Outro]
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
A side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone
I was already gone baby
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Boots and buckles, red clay and sand
My point ain't subtle here, I'm a southern man
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don't seem so damn modern
Where a good old boy like me still has a chance
[Bridge]
Aw, this is where I was born and this is where I'll die
Yeah, this is where I was born and this is where I will die

It's all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? 'Cause, Florida I'm thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia
Dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, it's all about the south
All about the south

From daddy's Don Williams to mama's Patsy Cline
We're walking after midnight singing Tulsa time
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don't seem so damn modern
This is where I was born this is where I'll die, oh that's right

The full moon
Is shining like a spotlight
I could just sit and listen to you talking all night
When you whisper
Yeah, baby, when you lean in
I get a crazy, crazy good kind of feeling
[Chorus]
It's like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushing of the water when the river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good to me
[Verse 2]
Tell me
All of your stories
And don't you leave nothing out
'Cause baby, I ain't in a hurry
Every little thing you say
Got a real nice ring to it
The way it rolls off your lips
Oh, when you give me that kiss
[Chorus]
It's like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings

Winding wild and free

567,642,We Are TonightBilly Currington,"[Verse 1]
Summer coming through a rolled down window
Tearing down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air
The night's still young, never going to get old
Living for today like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
Staying on the gas like we're never coming back
[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight
[Verse 2]
Swaying back-n-forth, can't you feel the music?
Time stands still, I don't want to lose it
Her tan, her touch, her laugh
Were flying so high like we're never gonna crash
[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

We are tonight, we are tonight
Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dream as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating

568,643,I Got A CarGeorge Strait,"[Verse 1]
She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you coming over, I already thought it over
And okay, so now what
[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car
[Verse 2]
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin
[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car
[Verse 3]
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out
[Verse 4]
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're going
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are

569,644,AutomaticMiranda Lambert,"[Verse 1]
Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree
[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic
[Verse 2]
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out
[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic
[Post-Chorus]
Automatic
[Bridge]
Let's pull the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake
[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

570,645,InvisibleHunter Hayes,"[Verse 1]
Crowded hallways are the loneliest places
For outcasts and rebels
Or anyone who just dares to be different
And you've been trying for so long
To find out where your place is
But in their narrow minds
There's no room for anyone who dares to do something different
Oh, but listen for a minute
[Chorus]
Trust the one
Who's been where you are wishing all it was
Was sticks and stones
Those words cut deep, but they don't mean you're all alone
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
Someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
Oh, invisible
[Verse 2]
So your confidence is quiet
To them, quiet looks like weakness
But you don't have to fight it
'Cause you're strong enough to win without a war
Every heart has a rhythm
Let yours beat out so loudly
That everyone can hear it
Yeah, I promise you don't need to hide it anymore
Oh, and never be afraid of doing something different
Dare to be something more
[Chorus]
Trust the one
Who's been where you are wishing all it was
Was sticks and stones
Yeah, the words cut deep, but they don't mean you're all alone
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more of this life than what you're feeling now
And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
[Bridge]
These labels that they give you
Just 'cause they don't understand
If you look past this moment
You'll see you've got a friend
Waving a flag for who you are
And all you're gonna do
Yeah, so here's to you
And here's to anyone who's ever felt invisible
[Final Chorus]
Yeah
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
It'll be invisible

Laid back in a thrift store beach chair

Like ""Honey, I sure want you""
And it's a hundred and three between her and me
And only 92 in Daytona

I'm all alone here watching it fall
TV's on but the sounds turned down
Somehow I knew he'd know to call right now
I oughta just let it ring
Because every time it's the damn thing
[Chorus]
Why is he always got to be calling me when I'm lonely?
It's so wrong to be leading me on when I can't say no
He swears that it's going to be different this time, but he won't be
Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?
[Verse 2]
He left a message saying he was only fifteen minutes away
And that's just enough time for me to figure out if I should stay or leave
But if I think it through
I ain't got nothing better than you
[Chorus]
Why is he always got to be calling me when I'm lonely?
It's so wrong to be leading me on when I can't say no
He swears that it's going to be different this time, but he won't be
Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?

He's at the front door now
With his magic smile
And he'll be gone tomorrow
But right now he's mine for a little while

All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', ""Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name""

Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay
[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
[Bridge]
I’m feelin' that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m comin' in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Hey Bartender
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender

579,656,Drunk On A PlaneDierks Bentley,"[Verse 1]
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane
[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
[Verse 2]
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
[Verse 3]
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
[Outro]
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

Here it go
[Verse 1]
Well, I won 2 dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought 2 more with it
And I won 10 bucks and that was just right
So, I bought a six pack and a, a bag of ice
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain’t like we really need a million dollar yacht cause
[Chorus 1]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank
[Verse 2]
Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I’d go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we’d tell our bosses they can do the same
We’ll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We’d sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why don’t you grab your bikini cause
[Chorus 1]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank
[Bridge]
However it goes (whatever happens)
We’ve got it made (in these shades)
Cause baby we can float (behind this boat)
We can ride away
[Chorus 2]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day
We’re laughing all the way, to the river bank

581,660,ChainsawThe Band Perry,"[Verse 1]
We scratched our names
In that oak tree
'Cause I loved you
And you loved me
A jagged little heart, so the whole town knew it
Carved in the bark with an arrow through it
I came out here to see it one more time
[Chorus]
And I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
(Woo!)
[Verse 2]
Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
Because I, I don't have you
[Chorus]
But I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
Whoa, oh
Yeah
Just a little ol' chainsaw
[Bridge]
I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote ""Forever"" with a pocketknife
But forever's going down... tonight
[Chorus]
'Cause I got my chainsaw
It's gotta go, it's such a shame doll
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sitting on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holding a chainsaw
Chain, chain, chainsaw
(Woo!)

Runnin round in this new truck
Bank lets me borrow from month to month
I'm runnin out of credit, find a little Cash on the radio
Standin still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?
'Cause where I come from, only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy
[Chorus]
Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this
[Verse 2]
Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here

Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes, walkin around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back
[Final Chorus]
Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The for sale sign's goin up and I'm gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this

Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah me and you back at Mama's

[Verse 1]
Around these parts, ain't much to do
Except work like a dog until Friday
Punch that clock, cash that check
Raise a little hell 'til Sunday (it's about that time)
About that time
There's a party back in the woods tonight
Heard it through the redneck grapevine
Got a keg of beer and a bunch of girls
Sure enough going to be a good time
[Chorus]
It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown
[Verse 2]
Oh, we about to throwdown, son
Now we got a field full of daisy dukes
Round here we know how to grow them
Rocking little body and long tan legs
Sure ain't scared to show 'em, now
Show a little something, girl
Somebody said them city boys
Riding around looking for some trouble
If they bring it across that county line
You know there's gonna be a rumble

It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown

It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light

And broke them rules with
This one's for my family and the way that I was raised

Then you cut me down

You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind

In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
If I'll ever OK, OK let me tell you

There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

Now it's all, all wrong

All the lies at the time but

Going to wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah

She was like a brand new song on an old guitar
Supernova in a Mason jar
Every boy in town wanted to show her around
As a dirt road, fence row, kudzu king
Beating along this American dream
Wrecked out the truck when she showed up
She had a fire inside her faraway eyes
And I knew just where to take her that night
[Chorus]
And we got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights
[Verse 2]
She's like a broken heart you can't wait to have
A shooting star that falls too fast
Try holding on, it's already gone
I searched that radio low and high
Tryin' to find a song to make a memory by
And I did alright, for a small town guy
But even in my arms I knew
I'd never shine as bright as her city lights do

We got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge

If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sitting in the parking lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks

Going to raise some hell, going to make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Want a bad boy

Well I'll be out by your driveway when your mom and dad lay down
You can climb on out that window babe
And we'll get on out of town

So hard you can barely breathe
And maybe you just might know what it feels like
Mmm, to be me

She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done
[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
[Verse 2]
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back
[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
[Bridge]
She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her
[Chorus 2]
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster

Everybody's always waiting on Friday
Watching that clock and sitting on go
Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
An open umbrella on the patio
I don't need a reason or a happy hour
Ain't hangin' 'round for a fireworks show
Get a head start, a little sip of somethin'
Off and running, here we go
One, two, three, here we go
[Chorus]
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
[Verse 2]
Blame it on the work day
Blame it on the heatwave
Blame it on the tick-tock movin' too slow
Blame it on any old thing you want to
Ready, get set, baby, here we go
[Chorus]
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking
Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking

Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking

I know you know what I'm thinking

I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

594,683,Cold OneEric Church,"[Verse 1]
It was a perfect day for the end of May, they say a record high
I was starin' at that green water
When out of the blue and by surprise
She had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice
She grabbed a beer, said, ""I'm out of here""
And walked out of my life
[Chorus]
That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that
Hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one
[Verse 2]
It ain't the first time, or last time I watched love walk out
But it's damn sure the one time I still ain't forgot about
I still like to drink a beer but a long neck I won't do
Cause every time I see one sweating, man
I break out in one too
[Chorus]
That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that
Hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one
[Chorus]
That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one
Damn babe, that was a cold one

I knew the first time should've been the last time
I ever let the whiskey touch my lips
Cause the devil wears black and he goes by Jack
And he's really good at helpin' me forget
I thought it was cool when I was a kid
Walkin' around with that cigarette lit
On that ol' dirt road, I lit my first smoke
And I knew right then it wouldn't let me go

And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah

Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down

Gotta different kinda high when I touched her skin
When she laid it on me, she rocked my world

Sittin' with the finest example of a beautiful girl
If we hadn’t hit the brakes, we’d have no idea

But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Doesn't mean they were always wrong

Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones

And I'm comin' off this
Long and winding road

I said whatcha want, she said, whatcha think?
I took a sip and we were slipping away
To a little corner table to the left of the stage
It was just some random night in July
No, there wasn't no fireworks up in the sky
Thought it was nothing, we were just having fun
Next thing you know

Whenever I get to reminiscin'
I think about how it started out
As a what's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' bout whatever, ended up being the best night ever

We were there, till they closed down the bar
Then we spent a couple hours leaning up on your car
Watched the stars fade out, my head on your shoulder
Saying baby, please don't let it be over

But I never found, whatever it was, whatever we had
No nothing no, nothing's gonna ever top that

Standing by the Yeti with the party lights plugged in
Got a jug of feel good, going around
There's just one thing missing, baby, right about now
[Chorus]
I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you
[Verse 2]
I see you dancing over there with your girlfriends
Got your fine self showing off that sun tan
You keep smiling that smile at me
Like you're reading my mind, and you know
[Chorus]
I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you
[Bridge]
I need a sweet little somethin' like you, girl
Sliding into my world
Yeah, I've been needing it all night
Slow kinda just right
Honeysuckle sweet little somethin'
[Chorus]
I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin'
Sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you
I wanna ride you round in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl, you got some serious
Sweet little somethin' like you
The way you slide that across the seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin' like
I wanna ride you round in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl, you got some serious
Sweet little somethin' like you
The way you slide that across the seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin' like you

609,699,Two Night TownJason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
I just spent three nights in a two night town
Sun's coming up and I’m just going down
Am I ever gonna turn my life around
I just spend three nights in a two night town
[Verse 2]
It was women, it was sinning, it was alcohol
It was everything the Bible says will make a man fall
And I didn’t wanna little lord I wanted it all
It was women, it was sinning, it was alcohol
[Chorus]
When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't falling my way
Why do I, always gotta stay to long 'til it’s too late
[Verse 3]
I just spend three nights in a two night town
With a bunch of lost souls out tryna get found
Girl I’ve been a little crazy since you walked out
So I just spend three nights in a two night town
[Break]
That's right
[Chorus]
When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't falling my way
Why do I, always gotta stay to long 'til it’s too late
[Verse 4]
I just spend three nights in a two night town
Suns coming up and I’m just going down
But baby this pain is still hanging around
I think I’ll spend four nights in a two night town

610,700,People Loving PeopleGarth Brooks,"[Verse 1]
Doctor, you ain't got a pill
For whatever's making this world ill
You can't get forgiveness at the store
And peace, it's a politician's war
[Pre Chorus]
You won't find no resolution in the bottom of a bottle
In the stars or Aristotle, the only answer to the problem is
[Chorus]
People loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
[Verse 2]
Words aren't what they seem to be
Talk is cheap but lies are free
We fear what we don't understand
We've been scared since time began
[Pre Chorus]
All the colors and the cultures circle 'round us on a spindle
It's a complicated riddle, the solution is so simple
[Chorus]
It's people loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
[Bridge]
You can pawn it off on kings and queens and those behind the curtain
Say one can't make a difference in a world so full of hurting
But I believe the remedy starts right here with you and me
[Chorus]
People loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
It's just people loving people

611,701,I Did With YouLady Antebellum,"[Verse 1]
I remember thinking 'bout forever
Sittin' there with you by the river
We danced in the headlights
And fell for the first time
[Verse 2]
I remember telling you I loved you
The northern star rising above you
And in that moment, I thought every dream would come true
Oh, but some just never do
[Chorus]
Love comes in circles
And love takes its own time
Bending and breaking, not taking a straight line
I never knew another love timeless and true
Oh, but I did, yeah, I did with you
Oh, I did, I did with you
[Verse 3]
Through the years I just kept on believing
There had to be a plan or a reason
But Heaven was silent and life just kept moving on
'Till my heart knew the moment was gone
Ohh
[Chorus]
Love comes in circles
And love takes its own time
Bending and breaking, not taking a straight line
I never knew another love timeless and true
Oh, but I did, yeah, I did with you
[Bridge]
Love is the reason why
Miracles never die
They just live on and on
Like a song, like a song
In the hearts of ones you leave behind
Ohh, yeah
[Chorus]
Love comes in circles
And love takes its own time
Bending and breaking, not taking a straight line
I never knew another love timeless and true
Oh, but I did, yeah, I did with you
Oh, I did, yeah, I did with you

612,702,That LookAaron Watson,"[Verse 1]
She keeps it all together
I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a dancehall Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a lonestar neon light
She has another side
That no one sees but me
She is the only one
That brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
[Chorus]
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
[Verse 2]
She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Slow dancin'
Romancin'
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but a beautiful smile
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a neon light

The week was long, but now it's gone, the drink is on
So fill your cup and turn the good time music up
Pick up that sweet, somebody wrap your arms around this Friday night
Get a little lost in the party
Float your trouble like a champagne bubble, saying
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
[Verse 2]
The night is young, the night is free, and so are we
So let it out and let me stay inside your drink
Lipstick all along
Next sipping star lie on the window tripping down
Off in the distance the lights of town
Can you see it now?
[Chorus]
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee

Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love

Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Two shots of Patron, don't wanna go home
2 AM in the morning, just you and I
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just bumpin' the night

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night

614,705,CruiseFlorida Georgia Line,"[Intro]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby
[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said
[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
[Verse 2]
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""
[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right
[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head
[Interlude]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
[Outro]
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww, yeah

615,706,We Are Never Ever Getting Back TogetherTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""
[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together

616,707,WantedHunter Hayes,"[Verse 1]
You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl
I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted

You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby I, wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever

Yeah, baby I wanna make you feel
Wanted

617,708,Better Dig TwoThe Band Perry,"[Verse 1]
I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white
[Verse 2]
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else
[Pre-Chorus]
Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:
[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
[Verse 3]
Well
It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart
[Pre-Chorus]
So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:
[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Dig two
[Bridge]
I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now
Oh, right now
[Verse 4]
If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rites
[Pre-Chorus]
And let the stone say:
[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!
There'll be a stone right next to mine
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead

618,709,Every Storm (Runs Out Of Rain)Gary Allan,"[Verse 1]
I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keeping on when you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up
You just keep spinnin' down, 'round down
[Chorus]
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain
[Verse 2]
So hold your head up and tell yourself
That there's something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose
Don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down
Keep on rememberin'
[Chorus]
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain
[Bridge]
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free, set you free

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna set you free
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna set you free

People say I'm just a rough boy
I ain't no good for you girl
It's a dead end street, trying to love me
Yeah, I'll wreck your world
I can see why they're all talking
Looking back at my past
I've got a bad name but a man can change
I'm living proof of that
[Chorus]
Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
All the way up till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
[Verse 2]
Baby I might meet all my friends
Shoot the bull, have a beer or two
But you know I'll be the first one to leave
In a hurry to get to you
Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes
I found a place to rest
Don't ever doubt that I'll be around
And baby don't you ever forget
[Chorus]
Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you

Darling yes I will

Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you

Oh babe, till my last day

620,712,How Country FeelsRandy Houser,"[Verse 1]
You were raised on an asphalt farm
Ain't never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes
[Bridge]
You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here girl
Let me show you how country feels
[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels
[Verse 2]
Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
Ever been so into somebody
You're still lying there when it comes back up
[Bridge]
Girl what do you say?
Cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels
[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels
Let your hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off
[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast

Let me show you how
Country feels

621,713,Beer MoneyKip Moore,"[Verse 1]
When the lights go down
And you're stuck here in this town
With nowhere to go
So you escape through the radio
And you worked all week
To barely make ends meet
Well, I gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket
[Chorus]
So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
[Verse 2]
We can dance in the dark
Blow the speakers out of this car
Light it up, burn it down
Until the morning rolls around
In a field where we can scream
Get away with almost anything
Yeah, every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail
[Chorus]
So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
[Chorus]
So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

622,715,Blown AwayCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down
[Pre-Chorus]
There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away
[Verse 2]
She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge
[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away
[Pre-Chorus]
There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Blown away
Blown away
Blown away

624,717,TornadoLittle Big Town,"[Verse 1]
Thought you'd change the weather
Start a little storm
Make a little rain
But I'm going to do one better hide the sun until you pray
I'm a tornado, looking for a soul to take
[Verse 2]
You're going to see me coming by the selfish things that you did
I'm going to leave you guessing how this funnel is going to hit
I'm a tornado, looking for a man to break
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found
[Verse 3]
Thought you'd take a swing
Try another girl, try another night
But it's the pain that brings my force of nature back to life
I'm a tornado more disturbed than an F5
[Chorus]
Hey, I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found, oh, yeah
[Bridge]
OOOOOOOOOOO
MMMMMMMMMM
[Chorus]
I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found
[Verse 4]
The winds are getting stronger
And the sky is falling through
And you ain't got much longer
Til the rage rips off the roof
I'm a tornado... and I'm coming after you...
[Bridge]
Oooo...
Hmm...
Oooo...
[Outro]
(I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground)

625,718,CreepinEric Church,"[Verse 1]
Like a honeybee beating on my screen door
I got a little buzz and my head is sore
And from my bed I can feel the sun
Lord I hear the morning come
[Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Verse 2]
You shot outta hell like a bullet from a gun
A flip of a switch
A thief on the run
And since the day you left me baby
I can feel the lonely
I can hear the crazy
[Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Verse 2]
Head for the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
And live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December
[Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Verse 3]
[Album version]
[Music video version]
Got under my skin and into my blood
That need you back comes over me
Like ivy crawling up a hickory tree
[Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Verse 4]
Head to the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
And live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December
[Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Outro]
Break it down, down, down, down
Just last night I saw the light
At the end of that tunnel on the other side
Thought I found my way outta this pain
Only to find your memory train
Creeping, creeping, creeping, creeping

626,719,Somebody's HeartbreakHunter Hayes,"[Verse 1]
I'd love to know just what you're thinkin'
Every little river, runnin' through your mind
You give and you take
You come and you go
You leave me here wonderin' if I'll ever know
How much you care or how much you don't
Whatever you need, whatever you want
[Chorus]
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
If you're gonna be somebody's mistake
If you're gonna be somebody's first time
Somebody's last time, baby be mine
If you're lookin' to be somebody's 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin', never callin' again, that's just fine
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine, yeah
Oh, be mine
[Verse 2]
I guess that all I'm tryin' to tell ya
Is a minute with you is better than two without
Oh, I won't be a fool but I can't play it cool
So I'm playin' it safe and I'm breakin' the rules
I'm wishin' I had what I know that you got
So if you're comin' my way then please don't stop
[Chorus]
If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
If you're gonna be somebody's mistake
If you're gonna be somebody's first time
Somebody's last time, baby be mine

If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine, yeah
Oh, be mine

If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Or somebody's mistake
Somebody's first time, or their last time
Baby, be mine

If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
Be mine (If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak)
Be mine (If you're gonna be somebody's mistake)
Oh, I'll take my chances
If you're gonna be someone's heartbreak
If you're gonna be someone's mistake
Somebody's first time, somebody's last time
Be mine
Oh, be mine
Be mine
Baby, baby, baby, be mine, all mine
If you're gonna break someone's heart, yeah
Might as well, might as well be mine

You might be a redneck ...
(radio static)
The Grand Ole Opry coming to you live from ...
(radio static)
[Verse 1]
When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shockin'
Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap, boots, and jeans
Not everybody goes to church
Or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to
""Ring Of Fire"" or ""Amazing Grace""
[Chorus]
Oh, Dixie Land
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee home
And I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone
[Verse 2]
I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me
To take a good hard look around and be a minority
[Chorus]
And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone
[Bridge]
I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, you have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White
I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I wish I was in Dixie Again
I miss my Tennessee Home
I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone
[Outro]
Look away, look away
I wish I was in Dixie, away, look away

628,721,One Of Those NightsTim McGraw,"[Verse 1]
She's getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick
Shimmy shakeing, right into them cutoffs baby, oh yeah
You're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
Here she comes now lookin' so fine
You've been waiting on this night for such a long, long time
[Verse 2]
She slides in and you roll down Main Street
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now, you're half way to heaven
She picks a song, you turn it up to 11
You say, ""Do you wanna?"" and she says, ""Hell, yeah""
So you hit the party, all your buddies are jealous
Someday you'll be looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
[Verse 3]
Crowded backyard, everybody's laughin'
Kinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened
Coming up on midnight, 'bout time to get gone
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song
You slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers, ""Baby, let's go.""
[Verse 4]
And when she slides in and she gives you the green light
You hold off 'till you turn on the headlights
Someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights
[Bridge]
Full moon through a crack in the windshield
You hold her close and you'll never forget how her heartbeat feels
No, you never will
'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
[Outro]
Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights, oh
One of those nights
This is gonna be, hey
This is gonna be
One of those nights
Oh, oh

629,722,Hard To LoveLee Brice,"[Verse 1]
I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me
[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
[Verse 2]
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you
[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted

I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Good

630,723,Begin AgainTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do
[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again
[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do
[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again
[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past
[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

I been waiting' for you, I've been waiting' for you
All the places that you go, all the people that you know
I've been looking for you, I've been looking for you
[Verse 2]
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets, all got something on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singing' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all say they're going' far
[Chorus]
Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long
[Verse 3]
Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song
Were you even here at all?
[Chorus]
Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long
[Verse 4]
Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say
And if you ever were here baby they ain't giving' you away
[Verse 5]
Now it's been two days
I'm still looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long
[Bridge]
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets, all got something on their face
Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand
[Outro]
Think I'll go back to the city, back to El Cerrito Place
That's the last time that I saw that pretty smile upon your face
I've been looking for you baby

Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time
[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

Two black Cadillacs
Two black Cadillacs
[Verse 2]
Two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then, he’d never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah
Two black Cadillacs
[Bridge]
It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave
[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils, they didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park
[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
Well it was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye
[Chorus]
She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away
[Verse 2]
Well she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive
She set my world on fire
On the fourth of July
We wrote our names in the sand
Under the star-soaked sky
But it washed away like she did
With the rising tide

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away

Every summer that rolls around
I'm looking over my shoulder
Wishing I could see her face
Wishing I could hold her

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away

The one that wrecked my heart

She spent the summer there

I feel the sweet release
Of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry

And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until it’s all alright

636,731,Beer With JesusThomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Heaven knows I'd sip it nice and slow
I’d try to pick a place that ain’t too crowded
Or gladly go wherever he wants to go
You can bet I’d order up a couple tall ones
And tell the waitress to put 'em on my tab
Yeah, I’d be sure to let him do the talkin’
Careful when I got the chance to ask
[Chorus]
Tell me, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Do you hear the prayers I send?
And what happens when life ends?
And when you think you're comin' back again?
Yeah, I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
[Verse 2]
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Yeah, I’d put my whole paycheck in that jukebox
And I'd fill it up with nothing but the good stuff
And sit somewhere and we couldn’t see a clock
[Chorus]
And ask him, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Have you been there from the start?
How’d you change a sinner’s heart?
And is Heaven really just beyond the stars?
Yeah, I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
[Bridge]
Now he can probably only stay, for just a couple rounds
But I hope and pray he’s stayin' till we shut the whole place down
[Chorus]
Ask him, how’d you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
What’s on the other side?
Is Mom and Daddy alright?
And if it ain’t no trouble, tell them I said hi
Yeah, I’d tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Yeah, I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

Dog tags hangin’ from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots
And a Go Army shirt folded in the back

But that flag and stone ain’t where I feel you anyway

But I just wanna draw the blinds and...
[Chorus]
Say goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight
[Verse 2]
What's the point of trying to pretend
That we don't wanna just give in
Why are we holdin' onto this day
Let's just let it fade away and...
[Chorus]
Say goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight
[Outro]
Baby I don't want to wait
I just wanna hear you say
Goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Oh go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight
Say goodnight

Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl, you know I love it when you

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It’s the best time of the year
I don’t know if there’ll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Say hello to friends you know

Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know
[Verse 1]
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that
[Chorus 2]
Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home
[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me
[Chorus 3]
Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

I've had my run, baby I'm done, I'm comin' back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright, I'll be home tonight, I'm coming back home

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell twist
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
[Chorus]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock

645,742,True BelieversDarius Rucker,"[Verse 1]
Church bells ringing on our wedding day
Climbed in that limo and rode away
Guess you'll always hear some people say
Man, they're never going to make it
We settled in and we settled down
In this quiet little seaside town
You are the rock I built my world around
And life will never break it
[Chorus]
We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers
[Verse 2]
It wasn't easy getting here today
Sometimes you stumbled or I lost my way
But every roadblock was a chance to say
Take my hand I'm here beside you
We worked and made it through the toughest parts
Now every day is another chance to start
To look around and see where we are
It's where we were trying to get to
[Chorus]
We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers

We are one before our God in Heaven
Oh, we are one road when the going gets rough
We are one now and forever
We are one name, one life, one flame

We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers

Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight
Except a loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer
So, baby tell me would it be all right
If we just take a little rain check and stay right here
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do
As a matter of fact, baby why don't you

Walk down the hall and turn down the lights

647,744,RedTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red
[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red
[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red
[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street

648,745,She Cranks My TractorDustin Lynch,"[Verse 1]
She's a wild rose waiting on me at the end of the road
Between the water tower and the power lines
We're a cloud of dust once I get her buckled in my pickup truck
She's ten pounds of sugar in a five pound sack
A Hollywood looker in a John Deere cap
[Chorus]
I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
[Verse 2]
Burning the backroads, sucking jet fuel from the radio
Cows and corn fields flying by
Gate's locked, hop the fence
Sneak past the barn where the riverbank bends
She's the best skinny dipper that you're ever gonna find
She can hit the branch with her bra every time, and
[Chorus]
I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
[Verse 3]
She's ten pounds of sugar in a five pound sack
A long straight away on a quarter mile track
She got a kiss that'll hit you like a heart attack
I got the rifle she's got the rack and
[Chorus]
I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

649,747,American HeartFaith Hill,"[Verse 1]
She's up before the sun, on the run
Another dollar, another day, another cup of coffee
Thank you Lord for giving me one more
She still leans on her dreams but it seems
Sometimes she's the only one who still believes
That life is hard, so she takes it on with an American heart.
[Chorus]
And it beats like a drum down in New Orleans.
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break an American heart
[Verse 2]
From the small town Friday night lights
To the Broadway neon burning up bright
We're all the same and it's in our veins
A spirit that you can't keep down
A fire inside that'll never burn out
If you are the owner of an American Heart
[Chorus]
'Cause it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break an American heart
[Chorus]
And it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break
You can't break an American heart
An American heart
An American heart

650,748,Can't Shake YouGloriana,"[Verse 1]
I still change the station
Every time they play that song
Can't drive past your house
So I take the long way home
Your black leather jacket
Still hangin' in my closet
I wish that I could give it away
Oh, even though you're gone, somehow you stay
[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you
[Verse 2]
I didn't wanna be here
But my friends all love this bar
I don't wanna see you
But I'm wondering where you are
And why am I still keepin'
The shirt you used to sleep in
It's been sittin' there for over a year
Oh even though you left me you're still here
[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

I can't shake you
No matter how hard I try
I can't shake you
I can't shake you
And I don't know why

Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing

Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

651,749,Hope On The RocksTo,"[Verse 1]
Brady was a baseball star
Til he struck out and took his car and drove away
Sissy lost her little boy
Hitch-hiked up to Illinois, so they say
Then it rained so hard that Mary tried
To take her life with suicide
And disappear just like the thunder
You ask around and no-one knows
Where they went or what they do
But you wonder, I know you wonder
[Chorus]
Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
They’re in need of a mindbender
I’m a bartender
At the end of the day
I’m all they’ve got
Hope on the rocks
[Verse 2]
Charlie’s wife filed for divorce
And Charlie bought a quarter horse and now he's ridin' fences
Upside down and couldn’t pay
They hauled Sue's mobile home away
And we ain’t seen her since
Larry’s long time fiancé
Got kicked out of the P.T.A
And moved her kids back east with someone else
All and the ones you used to know
Don’t drop in or say hello
But you ask yourself
I know you ask yourself
[Chorus]
Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer
They’re in need of a mindbender
I’m a bartender
At the end of the day
I’m all they’ve got
Hope on the rocks

Where do they go?
They come here
To drown in their sorrow and cry in their beer

Maybe I should take that picture off the dashboard
Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
Yeah, I bet she's still crying on that front porch
Yeah, this time it's gonna take some time to heal
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing ""Georgia On My Mind""
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing ""Georgia On My Mind""
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view
[Verse 3]
Yeah, more than miles
Yeah, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her
[Chorus]
So I’m turning back for Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can’t put my dreams before her
Man, I need her with me
Cause that girl’s in every song I sing
She’s in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Can sleep in the back tonight
Now I know what I’m supposed to do, yeah
There’s still more than miles in my rear view

More than miles, yeah
More than miles

Long legged women, velvet and lace
A country boy can't help but stare at your face
And I like your outlaw attitude
And I like that long black car
I might just be your ticket out of this old high browed bar
I don't care who you are
Throw me the keys, honey take a seat
I'll show you how to drive that thing
Ride shotgun, with a bootleg sun
Sure to make a city girl scream
[Chorus]
I'm gone take you places money don't go
I'm gone teach you what a country boy know
Gonna cover you in diamonds and dust
Where the stars fall on moonshine road
[Verse 2]
Roll down that window
Let down your fancy hair
Your a long way from New Orleans
Now nobody 'round here cares
Oh, can't you smell that jasmine
Hanging in the air
That's the ghost of old plantations
That burn the hell out there
Ya girl where almost there
Hold on tight, here come the ride
This is where the blacktop ends
Gonna loose those lights, a running blind
You'll never be the same again

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me
[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me
[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain

I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop
[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look
[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
[Verse 3]
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame
[Verse 4]
Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face
[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
[Bridge]
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

I came up out of the water
Raised my hands up to the Father
Gave it all to him that day
Felt a new wind kiss my face
Walked away, Eyes wide open
Could finally see where I was going
It didn't matter where I'd been
I'm not the same man I was then
[Chorus]
I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way
Into that place
Where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won’t go away
I hit my knees
Now here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am
Changed
[Verse 2]
I got a lot of “Hey, I’m sorry's""
The things I’ve done
Man, that was not me
I wish that I could take it all back
I just want to tell em’ that
Tell 'em that
[Chorus]
I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way
Into that place
Where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won’t go away
I hit my knees
Now here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am
Changed

I'm changed for the better
More smiles, less bitter
I'm even starting to forgive myself

Now here I am
Here I am, Here I am, Here I am
Changed
Yes I am
I’m changed for the better
Thank God I'm changed

Everybody down in Houston calls him ""Texas""
Everybody way up North calls him ""Cornbread""
You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him ""baby""
Daddy called him ""boy"", his friends call him ""crazy""
[Chorus]
Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him ""whiskey""
[Verse 2]
Warm my body to the core just like a blanket
His face was so sweet then he took my breath away
Hit me so hard like a rock through a window
I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you, boy
[Chorus]
Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him ""whiskey""

Now the numb has set in
He's gone like the wind
And I can barely feel the pain

Shoulda just called it like I saw it

658,759,The Moment I KnewTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy
[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""
[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
And that was the moment I knew
[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?
[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry, too""
And that was the moment I knew

659,760,Don't RushKelly Clarkson,"[Verse 1]
Let's wake up in the afternoon
Pretend that we got nothing to do
No we don't have to go by any agenda
We can make up our own rules
I see the way you're looking at me
Baby, know I'm feeling it too
We can just light up every candle
Move from room to room
[Chorus]
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be
Hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush (No, no)
Baby, don't rush
[Verse 2]
Throw the map out the window
Taking the long way around
To a secret place where no one could find us
A little place we can call our own
Come over here and take a picture
Something we can hang on to
We can look back and try to remember
All the crazy things we're gonna do
[Chorus]
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush
Baby, don't rush

Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute

Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush (No, no)
Baby, don't rush (Baby, don't rush)
Baby, don't rush, no
Baby, don't rush

Haven't seen you since high school
Good to see you're still beautiful
Gravity hasn't started to pull
Quite yet I bet you're rich as hell
One that's five and one that's three
Been two years since he left me
Good to know that you got free
That town I know was keeping you down on your knees
[Chorus 1]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses, we all got bruises
We all got bruises
[Verse 2]
Have you seen him? Not in years
How about her? No, but I hear
She's in Queens with the man of her dreams
Funny back then she said that about you
Que sera, you'll never guess who I saw
Remember Johnny B?
Remember him we were best friends, practically
Let's do this soon again, ten years is that what it's been?
Can't believe how time flies by
Leaving you makes me wanna cry
[Chorus 1]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses, we all got bruises
We all got bruises

I would love to fix it all for you
I would love to fix you too
Please don't fix a thing whatever you do

These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to know you've got a friend
But you remember now and then
Everybody loses

These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses
Everybody loses
Everybody loses

661,766,DowntownLady Antebellum,"[Verse 1]
Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin'
Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy, you know it's been a while
[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore
[Verse 2]
I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh
But you ain't getting uh-uh
If you don't come pick me up (Damn)
Show me off (Wow)
You might be tired, but I'm not
[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round

When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

Yeah, don't know why you don't take me downtown
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
I just don't get it

662,767,Pirate FlagKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you want to get naked
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip
[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl
[Verse 2]
Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say what the hell
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something about it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance
[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl
[Bridge]
Well I remember back home beneath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinking shooting stars
[Outro]
I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl

663,769,Like Jesus DoesEric Church,"[Verse 1]
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl
I'm a back row sinner at a tent revival
But she believes in me like she believes her Bible
And loves me like Jesus does
[Verse 2]
I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy
I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does
[Chorus]
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does
[Verse 3]
I always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday
That she loves me like Jesus does
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Yes, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
That devil, man, he don't stand a chance
She loves me like Jesus does

If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then baby, that's where we'll go
If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze
[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you
[Verse 2]
I'll bet there's a two lane
Running right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
We could send a postcard back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime baby you say when
[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

We'll plant some roots and some apple trees

And a fighter's heart like I knew she would

666,773,All Over The RoadEaston Corbin,"[Verse 1]
No sir I ain't been drinking
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzin'
From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best
[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road
[Verse 3]
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say ""Girl take it easy""
She laughs, says ""It'll be fine""
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines?
[Chorus]
Yeah, I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
And all over the road

Something 'bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go
[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me
Sir I'm sorry I know
I'm all over the road
All over the road
All over the road

Baby, you can crash my party anytime

Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-ho
[Verse 1]
Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks
[Verse 2]
But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that
[Chorus]
As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
[Verse 3]
Before you know it, it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere
[Verse 4]
Baby, I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end
[Chorus]
And as long I live, whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
[Verse 5]
Yeah, looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby, I can tell
[Chorus]
As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Now girl I know you used to the same old same
But we ain't floatin' that boat, no we ain't ridin' that train
Hop on my rocket ship and let's get outta here
Let me put a little shimmer in your atmosphere
[Verse 2]
Now let's get outta this town, outta this club
Girl whatever you're sippin' I'ma mix it up
Take a few tick tocks off of your clock
Put a little Third Rock in your hip-hop
I got that
[Chorus]
1994, Joe Diffie comin' out my radio
I'm just a country boy with a farmer's tan
So help me girl I'll be your pickup man
How 'bout a night to remember and a fifth of Goose

A little feel good you ain't never felt before
I'm talkin' 1994

Hey Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie

That your new favorite color is John Deere green
Hop in this truck aka Time Machine

675,786,See You AgainCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry, 'cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow
[Chorus]
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again
[Verse 2]
I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow
[Chorus]
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again
[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah, yeah

676,787,Jump Right InZac Brown Band,"[Pre-Chorus]
The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
[Verse 1]
Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby
[Chorus]
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby
[Verse 2]
There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby
[Chorus]
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby
[Bridge]
You can find me where the music meets the ocean
If you get the notion
Stop on by and play a while
A simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by
[Chorus]
And jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby
[Outro]
The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
Island lullaby

677,788,Little Bit Of EverythingKeith Urban,"[Verse 1]
I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow it’d be good for me
I want a cool chick that’ll cook for me
But’ll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want
And she’ll do it with me
[Chorus]
I don’t need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don’t need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
[Verse 2]
Now I don’t need a garage full of cars
But I’ll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I’ll smoke ‘em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Don’t need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ol' room
Still feels lonely when it’s just you
Yes it does
[Chorus]
I don’t need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don’t need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
[Bridge]
A little bit of everything
Under the sun
So, when I kick back basking in it
I’ll be okay with what I’ve done
Still having fun
[Chorus]
I don’t need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don’t need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na

680,791,Point At YouJustin Moore,"[Verse 1]
I've always been one of them boys
Rolling around in jacked up toys
Making noise on small town Friday nights
Red light running, good time chasing
Guess I've earned this reputation
Probably never shake it but that's alright
[Chorus]
I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Yea, point at you
[Verse 2]
Girl I ain't sure just what it is
That's got me all tore up like this
Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone
I still like to get a little crazy
But something about your loving baby
It breaks me down and makes me want to haul ass home
[Chorus]
I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Point at you, yea

Oh girl I wouldn't blame ya if you tried to change me
Lord knows I'm hard to hold

And I ain't letting you go
Cause my best side is holding me close
Point at you, yeah

681,793,Who's Gonna Fill Their ShoesThe Swon Brothers,"[Verse 1]
You know this old world is full of singers
But just a few are chosen
To tear your heart out when they sing
Imagine life without them
All your radio heroes
Like the outlaw that walks through Jessi's dream
No, there will never be another
Red Headed Stranger
A Man in Black and Folsom Prison Blues
The Okie from Muskogee
Or Hello Darlin'
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?
[Chorus]
Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?
[Verse 2]
God bless the boys from Memphis
Blue Suede Shoes and Elvis
Much too soon he left this world in tears
They tore up the Fifties
Old Jerry Lee and Charlie
And Go Cat Go still echoes through the years
You know the heart of country music
Still beats in Luke the Drifter
You can tell it when he sang I Saw the Light
Old Marty, Hank and Lefty
Why I can feel them right here with me
On this Silver Eagle rolling through the night

682,795,All Cried OutKree Harrison,"[Verse 1]
They say when the last tear falls
You can tell by the way it falls
It's like seeing everything for the first time again
It's not like the pain is gone
Just hurts a little bit less
You know you're going to cross that line
Who knows what you're going to find
It's only a matter of time in the end
[Chorus]
I'm all cried out
I'll let it run like a river
But it's empty now
And the only consolation is that
I can lie here in this bed
And put these memories to rest somehow
'Cause I'm all cried out
[Verse 2]
I never knew I had the strength
'Til I finally hit the ground
Now I have to make a choice to get up
Or stay down
For crying out loud
[Chorus]
I'm all cried out
I'll let it run like a river
But it's empty now
And the only consolation is that
I can lie here in this bed
And put these memories to rest somehow
'Cause I'm all cried out
And the only consolation is that
I can lie here in this bed
And put these memories to rest somehow
'Cause I'm all cried out
I'm all cried out

Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in, we'll just sail away

684,800,EasySheryl Crow,"[Verse 1]
We said that summer we'd go down to Cancun
But no money makes that kind of hard to do
Forget the beach – I’d rather be here with you
Playing Croquet okay, maybe, that’s not true

But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home

We’ll put on bug spray and we'll lose our clothes
Put out the lawn chairs and turn on the hose
We’ll play Jack Johnson, he’s the new Don Ho
And we’ll go surfing, surfing, we'll surf the radio

But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?

Later on we'll slip up to our king size bed
And make love, love, sweet love

On your side of the bed, there's a picture of our wedding day
A clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gave
It's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at night
Staring at the ceiling, lying here all alone
I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own
But you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly
[Chorus]
Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed
[Verse 2]
On your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame
A letter I started but I didn't know what to say
No I couldn't write it down, so I'll try to say it now
[Chorus]
Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

Aren't you even going to make a sound?
Your side of the bed
Turn the other way when I turn the lights down
Your side of the bed
Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?

How, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made

686,802,Hush HushPistol Annies,"[Verse 1]
My brother got out of rehab
Right around Christmas time
Mama made a turkey
Daddy was worried he was gonna have to break up a fight
Everybody was walkin' on eggshells
Drinkin' eggnog instead of beer
We were holdin' our tongues, scratchin' our heads
Wonderin' how the hell we got here
[Chorus]
Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush
[Verse 2]
We were sitting around the dinner table
And we were eating our pumpkin pie
While the sugar-coated pretty little secret
Was eating everybody alive
Well daddy's readin' propaganda
And he's talkin' 'bout the end of days
Well cheers to the vodka mama's been sneakin'
Let's all gather 'round and pray
[Chorus]
Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush
[Verse 3]
So I snuck out behind the red barn
And I took myself a toke
Since everybody here hates everybody here
Hell I might as well be the joke
I'm gonna dance up on the table
Singin' ""This Little Light of Mine""
God gave it to me, what good's it gonna do me
If I don't, by God, let it shine
[Chorus]
Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush
[Bridge]
Hide your tattoo
Put on your Sunday best
Pretend you're not a mess
Be the happy family in the front pew
[Chorus]
Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush
Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush

What are the neighbors gonna think? Better shut that mouth. Hush it. Be quiet. Shh

Best to keep it hush, hush

687,803,BuzzkillLuke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
You're like a screen flashing, insufficient funds
Cops knocking when the party's just begun
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup
A fumble on the one when my team was going up
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know
[Chorus]
You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill
[Verse 2]
I used to do everything I could do to do nice things
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change
Everybody knows you ended us
So why you showing up here on my side of the tracks?
Slipping in this bar just to check out where I'm at
I was a six pack in, now I'm as sober as a judge, cause
[Chorus]
You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill
[Verse 3]
As if it didn't hurt enough, now I got to see you flirt
Nailed to the stool, watching you work
Don't you give a damn about how I feel
You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're such a buzzkill
[Chorus]
You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill

Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here
[Verse 2]
Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
I've been workin' and tryin' and flirtin' and dyin'
For an all night kinda kiss
And country on the boombox, candles on the tool box
I'm doin' everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight
[Chorus]
Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here (Come on)
[Outro]
Yeah, that's how we do it round here
Yeah, that's how we do it round here

I feel a sin comin' on
I feel a right that's about to go wrong
I got a shiver down to the bone
I feel a sin comin' on
[Verse 2]
I got a buzz in my brain
Drunk on a love goin' down like champagne
I got a feelin' it's gonna leave a lipstick stain
And I'd be the only one to blame

All over my face
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall, dark, and handsome
Mix it up with somethin' strong
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on

I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town
[Verse 2]
I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah
[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train

Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Let’s go

In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running

Yeah, I think I’m gonna leave
I’ll just have that one drink
And we’ve all gotta be up early
Boys, we oughta shut her down
Just take it to the house
‘Fore anybody starts getting crazy
I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door

Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron, hang on
I just might have to stay hey
Aw naw, look at the time y’all
What happened to coats on, long gone
I should be halfway home but aw naw

Yeah, girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cutting up and shooting Bacardi

You turned around and we locked eyes

Aw Naw, do you hear that song
Oh one that just came on, c’mon

If we didn’t dance one, show off
Those jeans you painted on

No, I didn’t mean to be holding you
But, tell me, what was I supposed to do?

693,811,When I See This BarKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
Well I see the souls of so many friends
And I see us all back here again
With sandy floors and ceiling fans
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs
That fills my memories like a tip jar
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar
[Verse 2]
I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely because it's not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar
[Chorus]
Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place
[Verse 3]
And I see a kid coming into his own
And a man learning to move on
Somehow trying to find his way
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar
[Chorus]
Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place
[Verse 4]
A few have moved on back to Maine
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne
Some are still living the dream
Stuck in still life it seems
No matter where they've been
Or where they are
Yeah, I see them here
When I see this bar
When I see this bar
[Verse 5]
I wonder where we go from here
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
Life isn't over but it's always near
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
I think about all the good times that we had
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
It makes me happy and it makes me sad
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
How could we be so close, now so far apart
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
That's what I feel, that's what I see
Yeah we were living like pirates and want to be stars
That's what I see when I see this bar

That's what I see when I see this bar

694,812,Drinks After WorkTo,"[Verse 1]
Talk on the phone, stare at the screen
Doing' the job, living the dream
Getting paid
Yeah right
Thinking about what I'll say to prove
That we should go out for a laugh or two
Instead of going home tonight
[Chorus]
'Been a long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?
[Verse 2]
Happy hour's like a holiday
Hanging with you's like getting away
Let's conversate
For a little while
Well, keep me company, catch me up
It's a whole lot better than being stuck
In a drive-time 9 to 5
I'd rather see you smile

A long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually

Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

'Been a long day
And the boss don't get it
Don't you wanna take the edge off
With some 7 and 7?
Just crushing' on a friend
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
Sipping' and tipping' some drinks after work?
[Chorus]
A long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually

A yellow two piece, black Ray Bans
Your bare feet covered in sand
White jet trails across the blue sky
Your ponytail showing off the sunshine
Like a postcard, out of nowhere
You get to me, you give me that smile and

I'm somewhere, somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air

Kissing you and the salt air

I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
[Verse 1]
So we had a few drinks
Had some laughs at the bar
Stayed out too late
And went a little too far
Oh but wakin' up
With you on my chest
I had a pounding heart, and achin' head, and no regrets
[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name
[Chorus]
Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
[Verse 2]
Rule number one
Friends don't break
We could write it off
As a sweet mistake
Only time will tell
If we were wrong or right
All I know is I don't want to be alone tonight

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Me and you baby

697,815,All Kinds Of KindsMiranda Lambert,"[Verse 1]
Ilsa was an acrobat who went and fell in love with that
Horatio the human cannonball
A wedding 'neath the big top tent with barkers clowns and elephants
Sideshow family oddities and all
The dog-faced boy howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was crying
[Chorus]
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
[Verse 2]
Thomas was a congressman with closets full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights
Phyllis was a pharmacist, a dab of that, a pinch of this
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddling she'd slip 'em some Ritalin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive
[Chorus]
'Cause ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
[Verse 3]
When I play this old guitar from children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past
When I stood up in geometry and everybody stared at me
And I tossed my test into the trash
I scratched off my number while hitching out under
That bush league population sign
[Chorus]
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
[Bridge]
Now some point a finger and let ignorance linger
If they'd look in the mirror they'd find

That ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds

There's a bottle on the shelf
Talking to me
Saying, ""Come over here, you can have a drink.""
We can make it through this lonely night together
But that's a road I don't wanna go back down
And I hate myself for what I'm thinking now
Hey, it's just one night
It's not like it's forever
I just want to feel better
[Chorus]
I just want to feel good
Feel alright
Feel anything but what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
I just want to feel better
[Verse 2]
All these pictures
Running through my head
From the way he loved to the way he left
Not a single day goes by
I don't miss him
When the lonely gets to be too much
I try to kill the pain with a stranger's touch
Though I know I won't forget him altogether
I just want to feel better
[Repeat Chorus]
[Bridge]
I know there's gonna come a day
When he's still gone
And it's okay
[Repeat Chorus]
I just want to feel better

699,817,That GirlJennifer Nettles,"[Verse 1]
A friend gave me your number
To tell you watch your lover's tracks
See I always kind of liked you
So, I wanna have your back
There is a good chance by the time you hear this
The story's gonna say
That I came on to him
But it was never quite that way
[Pre Chorus]
I knew he was good looking
Maybe too good to be true
But when he kissed me in that alley
I could tell there was a you
[Chorus]
I don't want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don't want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up
With your guy
When I don't really wanna be that girl
[Verse 2]
I know boys can be promiscuous
Yeah, that's just what they do
But this involves the both of us
Yeah, it's our business too
So, I thought I'd call to tell you
It was never in my plan
I'm not the scarlet Devil
I don't want to take your man
[Pre Chorus]
Imagine how surprised I was
When he got up to leave
It wasn't my name on his lips
No, he didn't call for me
He didn't say, Jolene
[Chorus]
I don't want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don't want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up
With your guy
When I don't really wanna be that girl
[Verse 3]
We all know how the moral of the story goes
Be careful what you reap because you reap what you sow
I'm calling cause I really thought you should know
Even though he is that guy
[Chorus]
I don't want to be that girl
With your guy
To fool you
Make you cry
Wreck it all
For one night
To be with him when he should be with you
I don't want all the dirty looks
The headlines
So, I called you
To explain why
I wound up

And my heart started skippin' a beat
I was tryin' to play it cool, but I knew it was true
That nobody would ever compete

702,820,Dirt Road DiaryLuke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
Me and daddy'd ride around all day shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up
We would drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial
One little country station was all there was
Checking gates, fixing fence and roads
That is how my story goes
[Chorus]
If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Riding round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary
[Verse 2]
I remember when I turned sixteen; I got a license and some gasoline
There's no curve or a straight away we didn't fly down
It was not the boys, it was me and her by fire in a field or down by the river
Every inch of that county was sacred ground
Wish I knew where that old truck was
If it could talk, it could tell about us
[Chorus]
If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Riding round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary

It's not a book underneath my bed
Just a dusty memory lane in my head

Tan legs and some Dixie land delight, riding round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diaries
Just ride around this little town and you will see how I wrote my dirt road diary

You're my favorite song, won't you let me sing along

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere

A gun goes off in a far off city
A siren wails right here at home
Well sometimes life ain't all that pretty
When you're watching it all alone

You build a wall around your feelings
Just another heart afraid to break
And you don't wanna let me in cause really
What difference can I make?

I can't change the world
Baby, that's for sure
But if you let me, girl

But if you let me, girl
I can change yours

Never gonna let you down
Never ever gonna leave you

And the way I would lay and waste a day after day with you
We always go our separate ways
But no one can love you baby the way I do
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Well, the world can be real tough
Find shelter in me
If there's no one else to love
Keep me in mind
If ever you wanted me, I'll be your man
I'd be a fool to let you go with someone else
Whatever you want from me, I'll be your man
I'd give it all up just to have you for myself
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Well, the world can be real tough
Why don't you hold on to me
When there's no one else to love
[Outro]
Keep me in mind
(Keep me in mind)
And I'll hold you, darling
(Keep me in mind)
I'll be your man
(Keep me in mind)
I'll hold you, darling
(Keep me in mind)
Come on little mama
Put it on me

707,826,Tattoos On This TownJason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
There's still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain
And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see
""Allie, will you marry me?""
[Interlude]
Take a ride, look around
There ain't no doubt
[Chorus]
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
[Verse 2]
There's still a rope burn on that old branch, that hangs over the river
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallow ground
That we don't laughed or cried on
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff
It's everything we're made of
[Chorus]
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town
[Bridge]
Everywhere, there we are
It hits me right in my heart
[Verse 3]
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down
And we'll always be hanging around
Like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town

708,827,EasyRascal Flatts,"[Verse 1]
We broke up, yeah, it's tough
Most guys would've been crushed
Wasting their time, wondering where they went wrong
No way, not me
Hey, I'm doing just fine
I'm not afraid of moving on
[Chorus]
It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy every time I see her out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single guy does
But what she, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy
[Verse 2]
The truth is I miss lying in those arms of his
But I don't ever let it show
I laugh and I act like I'm having the time of my life
As far as he knows
[Chorus]
It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single girl does
But, what he, what he don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy
Oh, it's easy
[Chorus]
Oh, it's easy going out on a Friday night
Oh, it's easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
Forget about the way, oh
But, what she, oh what he don't know, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, it looks so easy
So easy, yeah-ooh

709,828,Let It RainDavid Nail,"[Verse 1]
It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame, it ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she throw out the window
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring
[Chorus]
So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain
[Verse 2]
Last thing I remember was the unfamiliar taste of someone on my lips
It's too late to turn around
When the shades start coming down
The guilt you feel is the last thing on your mind
[Chorus]
So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain
So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, just let it come down on me
Let it come down on me, let it rain
Ooh let it rain, ooh let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, ooh let it rain

Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good
[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot
[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end
[Verse 2]
Going to cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you’ll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold

From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around, you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is
[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Gotta whole new direction, it seems, these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Girl, if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking 'bout you
Just remember that

Tell me, have you ever wanted someone so much it hurts?
Your lips keep trying to speak
But you just can't find the words
Well, I had this dream once
I held it in my head
[Verse 2]
She was the purest beauty
But not the common kind
She had a way about her
That made you feel alive
And for a moment
We made the world stand still
[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night
[Verse 3]
You had me dim the lights;
You danced just like a child
The wine spilled on your dress
And all you did was smile
Yeah, it was perfect
I hold it in my mind
[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night
Oh yeah
[Bridge]
When the summer rolls around
And the sun starts sinking down
I still remember you
Oh, I remember you
And I wonder where you are
Are you looking at those same stars again?
Do you remember when?

We woke under a blanket
All tangled up in skin
Not knowing in that moment
We'd never speak again
But it was perfect
I never will forget

Just in case I get the notion
To let it run through my hand

Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light

Hand delivered to a lonely girl

715,834,RealityKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
For me it's a beach bar
Or on a boat underneath the stars
Or with my band up on a stage
For a while everything's okay
For some it's a fast car
Moonshine in a Mason jar
And everybody has their way
Somehow to escape

Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality (yeah yeah)

Yeah, some days it's a bitch, it's a bummer
We need a rock and roll show in the summer
To let the music take us away
Take our minds to a better place
Where we feel that sense of freedom
Leave our worries behind, we don't need them
All we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate
And we'll escape

You could be a blackbird
On the country street

Scared of the rain just as scared to sing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me

Well, here we are baby in the back of my bed
Suns going down skies turning red
Stars coming out
Baby look at you now

Felt that kiss and I can get used to this
Baby I could get used to this

717,836,I'm Gonna Love You Through ItMartina McBride,"[Verse 1]
She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, ""I know that you’re afraid and I am, too
But you’ll never be alone, I promise you""
[Chorus]
When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it
[Verse 2]
She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, ""I don't think I can do this anymore""
He took her in his arms and said ""That's what my love is for""
[Chorus]
When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it
Oh baby
Yeah

And when this road gets too long
I'll be the rock you lean on
Just take my hand, together we can do it

Land, blessed mother land
The place where I was born
Scars, yeah she’s got her scars
Sometimes it starts to worry me
Cause lose, I don’t wanna lose
Sight of who we are

From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know

It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home

Free, nothing feels like free
Though it sometimes means we don’t get along
Cause same, no we're not the same
But that’s what makes us strong

There’s a way to find
Better days I know

Brave, gotta call it brave
To chase that dream across the sea
Names, and they signed their names
For something they believed
Red, how the blood ran red
And we laid our dead in sacred ground
Just think, wonder what they think
If they could see us now
[Chorus]
It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home

It’s been a long hard ride
And I won’t lose hope
This is still the place
That we all call home

She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress
Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind-blown hair; it just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane
Gets its name from a girl like this?
She's a cat five kind, keeps you up at night
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss

She's a beautiful mess
Yeah, the kind you love to love
But what happens next?
I got a feelin' when the sun comes up

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
[Verse 2]
Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels
Somewhere between going and gone?
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on
She's a heart full of rain, red lips like a flame
She's a girl from your favorite song

What a beautiful mess
One part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget

Of a storm warning yeah

720,840,CamouflageBrad Paisley,"[Verse 1]
Kevin wasn't really all that popular in school
But I remember well the day I thought now that guy's pretty cool
He pulled into the parking lot and everybody cheered
Because he had gone and painted his entire Chevy Cavalier camouflage
[Chorus]
Camouflage it disappears when it pulls out of his garage
Camouflage-camouflage
[Verse 2]
I asked Jenny to the prom and her mom knew how to sew
So she made a matching tux and gown from Duck Blind Mossy Oak
We took pictures in the backyard before we went to the dance
And the only thing that you can see is our faces and our hands
[Chorus]
Camouflage
Camouflage you should've seen the way it popped with her corsage
Camouflage, camouflage, ain't nothing that doesn't go with camouflage

You can blend in in the country
You can stand out in the fashion world
Be invisible to a white tail, irresistible to a redneck girl
[Chorus 2]
Camouflage, camouflage
Oh you're my favorite color camouflage
[Bridge]
You can blend in in the country
You can stand out in the fashion world
Be invisible to a white tail, irresistible to a redneck girl
[Verse 3]
Well the stars and bars offend some folks and I guess I see why
Nowadays there's still a way to show your southern pride
The only thing as patriotic is the old red white and blue
Is green and gray and black and brown and tan all over too
Camouflage, camouflage
Designed by Mother Nature and by God
[Chorus 2]
It's camouflage, camouflage
Oh you're my favorite color camouflage

And I won't cuss your city lights
If you ain't ever took a ride around and cruised right through the heart of my town
Anything you say would be a lie

We may live our lives a little slower
But that don't mean I wouldn't be proud to show ya
[Chorus 1]
Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, nobody's gonna call the cops
Where I come from
[Verse 2]
See that door right there, man, I swear that it ain't never been locked
And I guarantee that it never will
That old man right there in the rockin' chair at the courthouse square, I'll tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his millions without one day of schoolin'
[Chorus 2]
Where I come from
There's a pickup truck with the tailgate down
Where I come from
The pine trees are singin' a song of the south
Where I come from
That little white church is gonna have a crowd
And yeah, I'm pretty damn proud
Of where I come from

Where I come from
There's a big ol' moon shinin' down at night
Where I come from
There's a man done wrong, gonna make it right

Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, ain't nobody gonna call the cops

Yeah, that river runs across that old flint rock

722,844,Bait A HookJustin Moore,"[Verse 1]
I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius, because he's into being green
My buddies said he saw y'all, eating that sushi stuff
Baby that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love
Sounds like it sucks
[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook
[Verse 2]
Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama, back in his home town?
Does he drive the interstate, or does he take them old back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song, every good old boy should know?
I didn't think so
[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook
[Bridge]
It won't be that long, until you start getting bored
I'll be smiling on the river, reeling in one more
[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook

No baby I ain't even worried
He can't even bait a hook

But you kiss me when you’re drunk
I don’t know your friends
Don’t know where you’ve been
Why are you the one I want?
[Chorus]
Don’t put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can’t stay
Don’t slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it’s okay

You’ve got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can’t be alone with you

Don’t put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can’t stay
Don’t slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it’s okay
Don’t say it doesn’t matter cause it’s gonna matter to me
I can’t be alone with you
You’ve got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can’t be alone with you
[Outro]
I don’t see you laugh
You don’t call me back
But you kiss me when you’re drunk
"
724,846,OursTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you
[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours
[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
[Outro]
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

725,847,My Heart Can't Tell You NoSara Evans,"[Verse 1]
I don't want you to come 'round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
Cause when you say it's over with her
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in, knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you
[Chorus]
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no
[Verse 2]
I don't want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me
Still I want to hold you, touch you
When you look at me that way
There's only one solution I know
You got to stay away from me
Stay away from me!
[Chorus]
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your sad eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no[x2]
My heart can't tell you no!
[Outro]
I don't want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
Living hell
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell

726,848,The Trouble With GirlsScotty McCreery,"[Verse 1]
The trouble with girls is they’re a mystery
Something about ’em puzzles me
Spent my whole life trying to figure out
Just what them girls are all about
The trouble with girls is they're so dang pretty
Everything about ’em does something to me
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be
[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me
[Verse 2]
They’re sugar and spice and angel wings
And hell on wheels and tight blue jeans
A summer night, down by the lake
An old memory that you can’t shake
They’re hard to find, yet there’s so many of ’em
The way that you hate, that you already love ’em
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be
[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me
[Bridge]
The way they hold you out on the dance floor
The way they ride in the middle of your truck
The way they give you a kiss at the front door
Leave you wishing you could have gone up
And just as you walk away
You hear that sweet voice say…
Stay
[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

727,850,Like My DogBilly Currington,"[Verse 1]
He never tells me that he's sick of this house
He never says why don't you get off that couch?
He don't cost me nothing when he wants to go out
I want you to love me like my dog
He never says I need a new attitude
Him and my sister ain't always in a feud
When I leave the seat up he don't think that it's rude
I want you to love me like my dog does baby
[Chorus]
When I come home, want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog
[Verse 2]
He never acts like he don't care for my friends
He never asks me where in the hell have you been?
He don't play dead when I want to pet him
I want you to love me like my dog does honey
He never says ""I wish you made more money""
He always thinks that pull my finger's funny
I want you to love me like my dog
He don't get mad at me and throw a major fit
When I say his sister is a bitch
[Chorus]
When I come home, want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog
[Outro]
I want you to love me like my dog does baby

728,852,Come HomeFaith Hill,"[Verse 1]
Hello world, hope you’re listening
Forgive me if I’m young
Or speaking out of turn
But there’s someone i’ve been missing
And I think that they could be
The better half of me
They’re in the wrong place trying to make it right
But I’m tired of justifying
So I say to you...
[Chorus]
Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
So come home
[Verse 2]
I get lost in the beauty of everything I see
The world ain’t as half as bad
As they paint it to be
When all the sons, all the daughters stop to take it in
Then hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin
It might start now
Maybe I’m just dreaming out loud
But until then...
[Chorus]
Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
So come home
[Verse 3]
Everything i can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why i need you here
Everything i can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why i need you here
So hear this now
[Chorus]
Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
Ever known
Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, so long
And right now there’s a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
To fight for you is all I’ve ever known
Ever known
Come home
I'm home

729,854,Christmas All Over The WorldTim McGraw,"[Verse 1]
In the desert they’re hanging Christmas lights
From a cactus Christmas tree
And all the way over the sea
In Tokyo, they’re hanging mistletoe
[Verse 2]
And way down south in Mexico
They’re singing Feliz Navidad
And over in Leningrad
Where the white lights glow
They’re dancing in the snow
[Chorus]
And the bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
The joy, the joy, the joy
They’re bringing
For every boy and girl
It’s Christmas time, all over the world
[Verse 4]
From Romania to Pennsylvania
They’re watching for that sleigh
Over in China Town
Someone saw him flying round
You know they can hardly wait
You might say Joyeux Noël
You might say Buon Natale
It won’t make a difference to me
No matter where you are
It’s gonna warm your heart
[Chorus]
When the bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
The joy, the joy
The joy they’re bringing
The bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
For every boy and girl

730,856,Somethin' 'Bout A TruckKip Moore,"[Verse 1]
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A ""No trespass"" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
[Verse 2]
And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice
[Verse 3]
And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
[Verse 4]
And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
[Verse 5]
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

732,860,Better Than I Used To BeTim McGraw,"[Verse 1]
I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aw honey I won't lie
[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be
[Verse 2]
I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust
[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be
[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there

I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

733,861,Dancin' Away With My HeartLady Antebellum,"[Verse 1]
And I finally asked you to dance on the last slow song
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over
[Chorus]
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart
[Verse 2]
I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you lean in to kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me
[Chorus]
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart

You headed off to college
At the end of that summer and we lost touch
I guess I didn't realize even at that moment we lost so much

Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart

Hey old friend, thanks for callin'
It's good to know somebody cares
Yeah she's gone, but I don't feel like talkin'
It might be just too much to bear
To hear somebody say it stops hurting
Or to hear somebody say she ain't worth it
[Chorus]
'Cause you don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
[Verse 2]
I can't forget, I'm drowning in these memories
It fills my soul with all the little things
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
So don't try to tell me I'll stop hurting
Don't try to tell me she ain't worth it

'Cause you don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me

735,865,He's MineRodney Atkins,"[Verse]
Old man knocked on my front door
With my teenage boy and a couple more
From up the road
He had him by the collar
Said he caught him shooting beer bottles
Down in the huller and smoking
I said is that right
He said, they won't speak when spoken to
So which one here belongs to you
And I know one does
Because they all started running
To your back forty
When they saw me coming on my gator
I looked in them in the eyes
And I said, he's mine that one
Got a wild-hair side and then some
There's no surprise what he's done
He's every last bit of my old man's son
If you knew me then
There'd be no question in your mind
You know he's mine
Yeah he is
Friday night football games
I was living for the speakers
To call the name
On the back of number thirty-seven
Just one-forty-five
And five foot eleven, Maybe
Limelight barely shined on him
But everyone still remembers when
He whooped up on that boy way bigger
For taking that cheap shot on our little kicker
And they threw him out
Aw man, you should, you should heard me shout
I yelled he's mine that one
Got a wild-hair side and then some
It's no surprise what he's done
He's every last last bit of my old man's son
And I'll take the blame
And claim him every time
Yeah man, he's mine and he'll always be
The best thing that ever happened to me
You can't turn it off like electricity
I love him unconditionally
I'll take the blame
And claim him every time
Yeah, y'all, he's mine
I thank God, he's mine

I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasn’t scared at all

I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight

You couldn’t see me
Watching through the window
Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldn’t go
You should have kissed me
You should have pushed me up against the wall
You should have kissed me
I was right on the edge and ready to fall
[Pre-Chorus]
So I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock, you turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

It was a Saturday night in a place back just like this
In the laughin' and the dancin', we were havin' one last kiss
There's nothing quite as lonely as a crowd when you're all alone
And there's nothing but Sunday morning waitin' for me at home
So why does everybody love Saturday night
Stale smell of beer and the smoke in your eyes
I keep sittin' and drinkin' and thinkin' 'bout a sad good-bye
So tell me why is everybody so in love with Saturday night
Well hey bartender could you throw those drunk girls out
And don't you think that band's just a little too loud
Tell that couple in the corner to please go get a room
It's a damn good party but what am I supposed to do

Why does everybody love Saturday night
Stale smell of beer and the smoke in your eyes
I keep sittin' and drinkin' and thinkin' 'bout our sad good-bye

With a pretty little dress
A smile in her eyes
Cause she's one of those who loves Saturday night

739,871,Million Dollar ViewTrace Adkins,"[Verse 1]
I don't need to be sitting on the roof
Of a high-rise looking at the city below
I don't need to be on the beach
Watching that sun sink in the Gulf of Mexico
If I climb to the top of a Colorado mountain
I could see forever from there
But I don't have to go anywhere
[Chorus]
I've got a million dollar view
Right here in my living room
In this little tin roof house
Even with the shades pulled down
And the lights turned out
I don't need to go to some exotic place
To see the kinda thing that takes my breath away
No, all I got to do is look at you
And I've got a million dollar view
[Verse 2]
When I see you laying there in that sexy nightgown
It burns me down deep in my soul
You're a living work of art
A sight that would inspire the likes of Michelangelo
If I took a telescope and pointed it to heaven
I wouldn't find nothing up there
That compares to what I got right here
[Chorus]
I've got a million dollar view
Right here in my living room
In this little tin roof house
Even with the shades pulled down
And the lights turned out
I don't need to go to some exotic place
To see the kinda thing that takes my breath away
No, all I got to do is look at you
And I've got a million dollar view

While we're trying to figure out
The next place we should go
[Chorus]
We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it
[Verse 3]
This place is closing down
But I don't want to quit
Got to good thing going girl
Let's find out what it is
[Chorus]
And drink on it
Your place or mine
Girl we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like we're doing something right
Let's find a corner of the night
Where you and I can just drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it
[Bridge]
Might make a memory that we won't forget
[Outro]
So let's just drink on it
Yeah
Mm
Drink on it
Sleep on it
We can just drink on it

742,876,Over YouMiranda Lambert,"[Intro]
Weather man said, it’s gonna snow
By now I should, be used to the cold
[Verse 1]
Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me
[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you
[Bridge]
Living alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I’m not afraid
[Verse 2]
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn’t mean to give them to me
[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you
[Break]
It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone
[Chorus]
Cause you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

743,877,BanjoRascal Flatts,"[Verse 1]
When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Can’t take a breath
Without getting sick
I’ve had enough
With this concrete jungle
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go
Beyond the pavement
[Chorus]
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo
[Verse 2]
It ain’t on no map
And I’m glad it isn’t
Leave the phone
And the GPS
Those satellites
Ain’t found it yet
Got our own little
Piece of heaven hidden
[Chorus x3]
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo

744,879,Even If It Breaks Your HeartEli Young Band,"[Verse 1]
Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll
[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
[Verse 2]
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night
[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
[Verse 3]
Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure
[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'

""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

Keep on dreamin'
Don't let it break your heart

There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like her and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

I've got boots and she's got wings
I'm hell on wheels and she's heavenly
I'd die for her and she lives for me

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous

I'm not sure why her path crossed mine
Accident or grand design
Oh, maybe God just kinda likes

Her kiss is my salvation

But anything i gotta get done

Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But i got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now

Don't wanna spend 'em all on the clock
In the time that we spent talking

747,883,Why Ya WannaJana Kramer,"[Verse 1]
Out of all of the places in this little town
Yeah, you had to come walking in here and sit down
I'm hiding and hoping my face ain't too red
Since we been over, been trying like crazy to get you out of my head
[Chorus]
So why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love?
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good?
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
[Verse 2]
I wish you had on sunglasses to cover up those blue eyes
I wish you said something mean to make me glad that you said goodbye
Why can't you look off somewhere if you catch me staring at you?
Why can't you be cold like any old good ex would do?
[Chorus]
So why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love?
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good?
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Keep wanting you
[Bridge]
Why, why, why
Would you tell me that you call me up sometime?
Maybe we can get a drink and just catch up
Like that'd be enough
No, that ain't enough

Why you gotta show up in a old t-shirt that I love?
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good?
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing
Moving in for a hug

Make me keep wanting you?

748,884,No HurryZac Brown Band,"[Verse 1]
You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills aren't going to pay themselves
Don't matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
[Chorus]
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
[Bridge]
When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have them take their time
When they lay this sinner down
[Verse 2]
Heaven knows that I ain't perfect
I've raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
(Going to get right with the lord)
But there'll be hell to pay
But I'm in no hurry
[Chorus]
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry today

749,885,Fly Over StatesJason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma
[Verse 2]
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?
[Verse 3]
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states
[Verse 4]
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat
[Verse 5]
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states
[Verse 6]
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)
[Outro]
Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride

750,886,SpringsteenEric Church,"[Verse 1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started
[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go
[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

I’ll be the bad guy
I’ll take the black eye
When I walk out
You can slam the door
I’ll be the S.O.B
If that’s what you need from me
So you don’t have to love me anymore
When you and our friends talk
Make it all my fault
Tell ‘em I’m rotten to the core
I’ll let it all slide
Get ‘em all on your side
So you don’t have to love me anymore
[Chorus]
I will keep
All those memories, of the good times
Yeah, there were some good times
So when you think
Of you and me
They won’t even cross your mind

If the wine you’re drinking
Leads you to thinking
That you want what we had before
Girl you can call me
I’ll let it ring and ring
So you don’t have to love me anymore

I will keep
All those memories, of the good times
Yeah, there were some good times
So when you think
Of you and me

Old boy at the bar with the stagger in his step
Looks like he's been rode hard and put up wet
Heartache's on him like stink on a skunk
He's fightin' off lonely, tryin' to drown it with a drunk
[Chorus]
Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock
[Verse 2]
Yeah, think he's still a little green, ya'll, he's fresh off the farm
Some pretty little thing put a whoopin' on his heart
He's walkin' to the left, leanin' to the right
Talkin' to himself, puttin' up a fight
[Chorus]
Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

He needs a long rope, boys, cut him some slack
Every now and then you gotta act like that

Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll

753,889,GlassThompson Square,"[Verse 1]
Trying to live and love with a heart that can't be broken
Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened
Yeah, we both carry baggage we picked up on our way
So if you love me, do it gently and I will do the same
[Chorus]
We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass, 'cause we are glass
[Verse 2]
I'll let you look inside me, through the stains and through the cracks
And in the darkness of this moment you see the good and bad
But try not to judge me 'cause we've walked down different paths
But it brought us here together
[Shawna]
So I won't take that back
[Chorus]
We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass
[Bridge]
We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake
We might burn like gasoline and fire, it's a chance we'll have to take

We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human and we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass, we are glass

But not near enough to satisfy an itch
Of a girl, understand

I don't work, on a car
And I'm as bad at pool as I am at throwin' darts
And golf, not a fan

Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am

On this old guitar, if it turns you on

Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon

I remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
But one look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me
[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined
I'm ruined
[Verse 2]
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me?
I should've gone over, right over
I shoulda never let you leave
But it's the never-knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy

Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller

758,899,Beers AgoTo,"[Verse 1]
I had a hand-me-down ride painted rattle-can red
Second hand tires with poor boy tread
Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that
Truck that got stuck a lot
Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learning ‘bout right by doin’ it wrong
Hopin’ we didn’t get caught
[Chorus]
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Oh
[Verse 2]
Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place and she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues ‘bout
[Chorus]
Spendin'what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fifteen hundred and sixty two beers ago
Oh

And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks

On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was sixteen hundred and fifty two beers
Whole lot of highway, whole lot of years
Sixteen hundred and fifty three beers ago
Oh

I was sitting at the cafÈ for a bite
Couldn’t help but overhear this guy
He just pulled up in a U-Haul truck
Tell Becky how pumped he was
‘Bout movin’ here for his new job
And what a cool little spot it was
Kinda made me jealous, made me mad
Wish I could see this place like that
[Chorus]
Yeah I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin’ in, checkin’ it out
For the first time
Wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid
Of finding you there
Yeah girl when I see you around
I wish I was new to this town
[Verse 2]
I can’t put my feet on this sidewalk
Without hearin’ you laugh or hearin’ you talk
And every street’s a memory
Of just how good it used to be
I can’t walk into that corner bar
Without someone askin’ how you are
And how you’re doing and how you been
I gotta go through it all again

Stop at that stoplight
Not think about you

I wish I was new to this town, oh yeah
I wish I was new to this town

You’ve got a cousin who’s telling you somethin’
That doesn’t have nothin’ to do with the lovin’ that we’re in, baby

Love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, cryin' in the rain

My heart’s never smiled so hard
Baby, lovin’ you is fun

Well ya, you think you know it all

762,903,The Sound Of A Million DreamsDavid Nail,"[Verse 1]
Seeger was singing words I could believe in
Main Street was my street at night
So I called on Samantha and asked her the chance
Of us running out 'neath the moonlight
Well, she's not with me now, she can always be found
When I rewind the radio dial
And like it was then I feel her on my skin
And I'm back there for a while
[Chorus]
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pourin' my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
And maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams
[Verse 2]
My eighteenth summer, I was a cocky up-and-comer
Cranking up Born to Run
Turned left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a prodigal son
My spirit was broken, she threw the door open
I love you, not I told you so
When I hear Mama Tried, I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road
[Chorus]
And I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight
And maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams
The sound of a million dreams

The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer but my favorite color is
[Chorus]
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon
[Verse 2]
The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime
For people like us
Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted that's why they invented
[Chorus]
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on

Do you smoke, do you drink
Do you yell out, ""Hank""

Do you lock it in the bank
Do you jack it up, or drop it down to the ground
Put the juice in the Goose
Or the Coke in the Crown

Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
Yeah, you can kick it back chilling

Try to seal the deal
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star

Do you kick the dirt, or work a Vegas stop
Do you hit the strip, or roll a country mile
Do you wear uptight, or do keep it loose
Do you leave it in the truck
Or sneak it in in your boot

Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
Yeah, you can kick it back chilling
Or you can rock hard
You busted your ass all week

Yeah, you can kick it back chilling

All I saw was smoke and fire
I didn’t feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love
[Hook]
And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you
[Verse 2]
Maybe you don’t understand
I don’t understand it all myself
But there’s a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
He’s got a photograph
And they’re waiting for him back home
It’s weighing on my mind
I’m not trying to be a hero
I don’t wanna die
But right now in this moment, you don’t think twice
[Hook]
And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you
You don’t think about right
You don’t think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do, to defend your own
And I’d do the same
For you
Yes I would
I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice
Cause if it came down to it
Could I take a bullet
For you
Yes I would
I’d do it for you

Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open

30,000 feet above
The city where I fell in love with you
And the fading concrete skyline
Brings an urban lullaby that still rings true
When I passed you on the street that day
Should've let that red scarf fly away
Like any chance I had of keeping you
Like the Northern wind blowing
Yeah, my lonely heart was frozen
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours, too
[Chorus]
Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love
[Verse 2]
The city lights look like a country sky
Like staring at the stars turned upside down
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find it in your heart to stick around
I hate it had to end this way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
And the chances here at love are precious few
Someone's out there waiting
For a sweet good timing lady
To make you smile the way I always wanted to

Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

So I will fly all night
Our memory's my lullaby
That love will not lie
If it is love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
Arms open wide
If love do not lie
Lie
We can fly

Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

775,923,Drinkin' ManGeorge Strait,"[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and I swore to God
I'd never, ever take another drink again
I fought it like the devil, but you know that you're in trouble
When you're fourteen and drunk by 10 am
Tried to hide it from my mom and dad, all my friends said ""Straighten up""
I just laughed, said, ""You don't understand
That's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man""
[Verse 2]
At sixteen I was on my own and flying high and staying stoned
I knew everything there was to know
I did things that I can't talk about
I wore my mom and daddy out
Late nights they spent praying for my soul
Stayed sober once for nine days in a row
I quit cold turkey and damn near almost made it to ten
But that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man
[Chorus]
I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can
Cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man
[Verse 3]
I don't know when or where it was or how we met and fell in love
Or why she'd even fall for a guy like me
I tried to pull myself together, hoping we could last forever
For a while I started to believe
Her daddy said, she's all I got
Son, don't ever break her heart
Promise me before you take her hand
But that's just too much to ask of a drinking man
[Chorus]
I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can
Cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man
[Outro]
I woke up this morning and I swore to God
I'd never, ever take another drink again

Been running this highway like a greyhound
Ain't nothing left for me to see
And sometimes I just wish that I could break down
And get on back to you and me
Take the next flight and leave this crazy life
Get back home in time to kiss you goodnight
[Chorus]
And whoa oh oh, lately all I think about
Whoa oh oh, is what we could be doing now
Whoa oh oh, baby
Here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
Sitting here listening to your sweet voice
Talking on the telephone
It's making me realize, I ain't got no choice
Between staying here and getting gone
I'm gonna say good-bye
Yeah I'm gonna fly
Get these arms of mine back where they belong

Whoa oh oh, lately all I think about
Whoa oh oh, is what we could be doing now

777,926,Water Tower TownScotty McCreery,"[Verse 1]
In a water tower town everybody waves
Church doors are the only thing that's open on Sundays
Word travels fast, wheels turn slow
Yeah working hard and living right is the only life we know
[Chorus]
Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
The fireflies come out when the sun goes down
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them
You can see who loves who for miles around
In a water tower town
[Verse 2]
Where your friend's a friend and your word's your word
And our pickup trucks, they ain't for looks, they're made for work
Corn grows high, crime stays low
There's little towns everywhere where everybody knows
[Chorus]
Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
And the girls come out when the sun goes down
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them
You can see who loves who for miles around
In a water tower town

Yeah, Friday night football is king
Sweet tea goes good with anything
Peace and quiet make such a beautiful sound
Nobody eats until you say Amen
And everybody knows your mom and them

Yeah, in a water tower town

In the mornin' on a Saturday, I got my girls and we're skippin' town
In my '67 442 got the rag top down
Aldean's on the radio, ain't it funny how they sing along
Makes you smile just a little bit because it's not a Miley Cyrus song
[Pre-Chorus 1]
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
[Chorus]
Loadin' up and livin' right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and the fishin' poles
What a way to save my soul
This endless summer
[Verse 2]
Now we're at our little getaway, Zoe go and grab the fishin' poles
I can't think of any other better way for us to cleanse our souls
Fresh trapper on the wheel tonight, cherrystones straight out the shell
Just another day in paradise, another story I can tell

These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
[Chorus]
Loadin' up and livin' right

Monday mornin' and it's gettin' late
There's no traffic at the tollbooth line
Aldean's on the radio
And my three girls know every line

And these are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

Loadin' up and livin' right

Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer night

Been going round and round all day
Bailing some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a couple Shiner Bock
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock
[Chorus]
Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you
[Verse 2]
I hope you are wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that is a good night
Anyone from the heartland is going to understand
What I am talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over

782,938,Eighteen InchesLauren Alaina,"[Verse 1]
It’s about fifteen hundred miles to California
They’ll get there Friday if they leave tonight
She sneaks out at 3:30 in the morning
Leaves a note so she won’t see her daddy cry
He cuts the engine when he coasts in the driveway
She slides in and gives him one kiss for the road
No friends and no family
No job out there waiting
The whole town will call them crazy, but they gotta go
[Chorus]
'Cause when you’re young and in love, yeah
You might do some things that don’t seem all that smart
'Cause there ain’t no greater distance
Than the eighteen inches from your head to your heart
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
They can barely make rent on a rundown apartment
She’s waiting tables and he’s a valet
They’re behind on the bills and the car’s barely running
But he buys a ring with the tips that he’s saved
[Chorus]
When you’re young and in love, yeah
You might do some things that don’t seem all that smart
'Cause there ain’t no greater distance
Than the eighteen inches from your head to your heart
[Verse 3]
Last thing they need is another mouth to feed
But they want one
They’re just kids themselves
But that’s gonna change in nine more months
[Bridge]
She wakes him up at 3:30 in the morning
Ready or not, their new life’s gonna start
Seven pounds and eighteen inches
The doctor lays that new baby’s head right on her heart

When you’re young and in love, yeah
You might do some things that don’t seem all that smart
But thank God for those eighteen inches
The distance it is from your head to your heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

783,943,Just Wanna Rock N' RollRodney Atkins,"[Verse 1]
Times are tough and times are strange
But time's one thing that you can't change
Love is a noun and love is a verb
But sometimes love is a dirty word
It don't matter what tomorrow brings
Tonight you just need to think about one thing
And that's showing up and letting go
And maybe getting just a little out of control
[Chorus]
And sing ohh
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night, in the lights
Cuttin' loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
That's all I'm talking about
[Verse 2]
The sun will shine
And the clouds will rain
Might have to learn to smile through the pain
You lose a step but you gain a friend
Might even catch a break every now and then
So don't sweat it just let it slide
And when you get on the road baby let it ride
You gotta get up to get down
You gotta unwind a little to come on 'round
[Chorus]
And sing ohh
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night, in the lights
Cuttin' loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out
That's all I'm talking about

And when you get tired of trying to be
Who they want you to be
Be what you wanna be
Well come on, come on

And sing ohh
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Gather up a couple of friends
Let a shot hit the spot
And the party begin
And sing ohhh yeah
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Lose yourself out in the crowd
In the night, in the lights
Cuttin' loose some love
Drown all the stressed up
Theft up messed up out

Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Don't you just wanna rock 'n' roll
Gather up a couple of friends

Got us a sunset sinking into a Friday night
Got us some beer needs drinking hey and we just might
Sometimes we got to make it up as we go
But laying low ain't all that goes on 'round here

It might look a little laid back to ya
But it is not all just porches and plows
But do not let that one red light fool ya
There is always something going down
In this nothin' town

That old abandoned factory just got the wrecking ball
We threw a party in the parking lot just to watch it fall
Sometimes we got to make it up as we go

I was looking for a slow down
When you came around

I never left a bar room or a beer joint
Till the lights went out
But in the middle of a long slow kiss
The light came on
I been doing this all wrong

And all my life I been running
And all these nights I've wasted
All this time I been on the move
I think I'ma stop now and
Bring it on home with you

Slip on my boots
Now I'm good staying here

787,950,Feel That AgainJason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
A river in July, two kids on summer break
Another record high, clothes scattered on the bank
The rush of jumping in, I want to feel that again
[Verse 2]
Sun going down, build a fire in the dirt
You're dancing all around, wearing my t-shirt
The way you pull me in, I want to feel that again
[Chorus]
Guitar coming through the speakers
That song you never want to end
Gimme some of that you and me
Some of that way back when
A little bit of wild and free
I want to feel that again
[Verse 3]
Nothing but a blur, gravel road, a flatbed Ford
Always was the cure, ooh whenever we got bored
Sideways 'round the bend, yeah I want to feel that again

Guitar coming through the speakers
That song you never want to end
Gimme some of that you and me
Some of that way back when
A little bit of wild and free

788,951,RonanTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear
[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtain room and this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

Baby since you have been gone
I leave the TV on
Got to hear somebody's voice
I just need some kind of noise
I lay some pillows down
To wrap my arms around
I pretend I'm holding you
I know it is sad but it is what I do
To keep me from going crazy
[Chorus]
I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh, but I don't do lonely well

I got some real good friends
Check on me now and then
Try to get me out at night
They say I need to get a life
It is easy to say alright
When you're not the one going crazy

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh, but I don't do lonely well

Here comes another sunset
Here comes another long night
I am not over you yet
No, I am not over you yet

Washes all my cares away
At the end of a long, hot day

After being gone too long
She's like finally coming home

Let me tell you where to go

I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine
[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party
[Verse 2]
If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo
[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

Oh baby you can find me

Sitting round watching all these pretty things

793,957,Felt Good On My LipsTim McGraw,"[Verse 1]
Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips
[Verse 2]
She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rocking on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said, ""Let's go and get it on""
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don’t know what it meant but it felt good on my lips
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you
[Chorus]
Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
[Verse 3]
She ordered us a drink, it was a purple kind of pink
She said it’s got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mellow yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with
But I took a sip, yeah it felt good on my lips
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you
[Chorus]
Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
[Verse 4]
When the lights came on and they hollered last call
I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss
In a little corner booth, eye to eye no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long
And wet Goodnight goodbye kiss and It felt good on my lips
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Outro]
Whoa, how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
Whoa, how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips

Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers
[Chorus]
And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
[Verse 2]
Mama, there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes
[Chorus]
'Cause he is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
[Bridge]
And when I watch my baby grow up
I only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to our prayers
And that she'll say
[Chorus]
He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

795,959,Somewhere With YouKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you
[Chorus 1]
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
[Chorus 2]
You said pick me up at three a.m
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you
[Verse 2]
I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you
Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear
I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
[Chorus 3]
I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you
If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you
[Chorus 1]
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
[Chorus 2]
You said pick me up at three a.m
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you
[Chorus 3]
I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

Somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you

Well here you come again and you're looking so fine
You don't notice me but it's alright
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words, it's true
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I want to put you in a melody, I got to set you into a groove
[Chorus 1]
I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl oh
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song, oh oh oh
[Verse 2]
Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
It'd be so easy, I'd just write it from my heart
Because I got to tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be
Stuck in my head all day
Because you're already there anyway, yes you are

I want to put you in my car and drive

And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah
And when they see you on the street they'll say

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out

798,962,VoicesChris Young,"[Verse 1]
You could say I'm a little bit crazy
You could call me insane
Walking around with all these whispers
Running around here in my brain
I just can't help but hear 'em
Man, I can't avoid it, I hear voices
I hear voices
[Chorus]
Like, my dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And momma telling me to drop some cash
Into the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time
[Verse 2]
Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky
For all that good advice
Those hard to find words of wisdom
Hold up here in my mind
And just when I lost my way
Or I got too many choices, I hear voices
I hear voices
[Chorus]
Like, my dad saying quit that team
And you'll be a quitter for the rest of your life
And Momma telling me to say a prayer
Every time I lay down at night
And Grandma saying if you find the one
You better treat her right
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

Sometimes I try to ignore them
But I thank God for them
'Cause they made me who I am

My dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away

799,963,The Breath You TakeGeorge Strait,"[Verse 1]
He looks up from second base, dad's up in the stands
He saw the hit, the run, the slide, there ain't no bigger fan
In the parking lot after the game
He said, ""Dad, I thought you had a plane to catch?""
He smiled and said, ""Yeah, son, I did""
[Chorus]
But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
You just might miss the point trying to win the race
Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away
[Verse 2]
Fast forward fifteen years and a thousand miles away
Boy's built a life, he's got a wife and a baby due today
He hears a voice saying, ""I made it son""
Says, ""I told you dad, you didn't have to come""
He smiles and says, ""Yeah, I know you did""
[Chorus]
But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
You just might miss the point trying to win the race
Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away
[Bridge]
Just like it took my breath when she was born
Just like it took my breath away when dad took his last that morn
[Verse 3]
Life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
Just might miss the point if you don't slow down the pace
Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away

800,964,As She's Walking AwayZac Brown Band,"[Verse 1]
We never spoke a word
But every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
We were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame
[Chorus]
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
I may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
[Verse 2]
Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance
(Go on son)
[Pre-Chorus]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith
[Chorus]
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
[Pre-Chorus]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away

Now you want to go back (Now you want to go back, yeah)
Why, tell me why (Tell me why, tell me why)
I don't pay attention to you anymore  (No)
For some time I decided to stop fighting for us
[Chorus]
What do you mean (Yeah), by calling me at this hour? (At this hour)
I already know that attitude (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
You know very well what to do to seduce me (To seduce me)
But this time it's too late (Uah; oh-oh-oh)
[Verse 1]
These are not hours to call me (No!)
Unless you want to suck my dick
That you want to smoke, that you want to smoke (Wu-huh)
If I'm honest, I didn't feel good about you (Nah!)
Because of you, I took pills and I had an overdose like Lamar (Woh!)
But you aren't a Kardashian (No!)
With you I will not be back 'cause for me you are a garbage
I deleted you from Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and even my life (Prra!)
[Pre-Chorus]
And now you want to go back (Nah)
Nah, what you want is to take advantage of me (Wuh)
But that's not going to happen (Fuck you)
You're going to see me with someone else and it's going to hurt
And now you want to go back
Nah, what you want is to take advantage of me
But that's not going to happen
You're going to see me with someone else and it's going to hurt (Nah)

What do you mean by calling me at this hour?
I already know, yeh, that attitude
You know very well what to do to seduce me
But this time it's too late, yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
[Verse 2]
You're trying everything to get me back with you
Things are not the same, why do you keep insisting?
Stop wasting your time, stop bothering yourself
With me you will not achieve anything
You keep watching our photos secretly, checking my profile
Don't deny it, I know you
[Bridge]
You want to repeat everything you did with me
You're looking for more, and I'm not interested
You want to repeat everything you did with me
You're looking for more, and I'm not interested

What do you mean (Yeah), by calling me at this hour? (At this hour)
I already know that attitude (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
You know very well what to do to seduce me (To seduce me)
But this time it's too late (Uah; oh-oh-oh)

My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
[Chorus]
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
[Verse 2]
Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad?
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails?
Call up mamma when all else fails?
Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right, are you thinking of me?

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

803,967,Back To DecemberTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die
[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye
[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

Traffic crawls
Cell phone calls

Through my tinted window I see
A little girl
A rust red minivan
She's got chocolate on her face
Got little hands
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And she waves at me
Yeah, she smiles at me
[Chorus]
Well, hello world, how ya been?
Good to see you my old friend
Sometimes I feel, cold as steel
Broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, a little hope, in a little girl
Well, hello world
[Verse 2]
Every day I drive by
A little white church
It's got these little white crosses
Like angels in the yard
Maybe I should stop on in
Say a prayer
Maybe talk to God
Like he is there
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh, I know he's there
Yeah, I know he's there
[Chorus]
Well, hello world, how ya been?
Good to see you my old friend

And broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, a little grace, a little faith unfurl
Well, hello world

Sometimes I forget what living's for
And I hear my life through my front door
And I'll be there, oh, I'm home again
I see my wife, my little boy, little girl
Hello world
Hello world

All the empty disappears
I remember why I'm here
Just surrender and believe
I fall down on my knees
Oh, hello world
Hello world
Hello world

There's a little moonlight, dancing on the sand
There's a warm breeze blowing by the ocean as you're taking my hand
You need to know where I'm standing now
That I'm right on the edge of giving in to ya
Baby it's a long way down
[Chorus]
If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're going to treat it right?
I'm barely hanging on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?
[Verse 2]
The scent of your perfume, floating in the air
Looking like an angel, lying on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips, look to good to be true
Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen
I'll be at the mercy of you
[Chorus]
If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're going to treat it right?

806,970,Bullets In The GunTo,"[Verse 1]
They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song
[Verse 2]
I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yea
[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
[Verse 3]
She was sitting on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac DeVille
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for, no
[Verse 4]
She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us, man
You're dumb enough to die
[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah
[Verse 5]
We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're running from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I could not spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel
[Verse 6]
I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my .44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back
[Bridge]
Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air
[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun

And telling folks Jesus is the answer can rub them wrong
It is not hip to sing about tractors, trucks, little towns, and mama, yeah that might be true
But this is country music and we do
[Verse 2]
Do you like to drink a cold one on the weekend and get a little loud
Do you want to say I'm sorry or I love you but you don't know how?
Do you wish somebody had the nerve to tell that stupid boss of yours
To shove it next time he yells at you?
Well this is country music and we do
[Bridge]
So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Yeah this is country music
[Verse 3]
Are you haunted by the echo of your mother on the phone
Crying as she tells you that your brother is not coming home?
And if there's anyone that still has pride and the memory of those
That died defending the old red, white, and blue
This is country music and we do
[Verse 4]
So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Just like a road that takes you home
Yeah this is right where you belong

Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Want a little more right, and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
[Verse 2]
I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course
But my definition of change
Just ain't the same
I'm gonna sit right here
Stay away from there
I'm gonna make pretend
I just don't care
And I could get up
Go get her back
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
(ah come on now)
Go get her back (ohhh)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink smoke a little, smoke

Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash

Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, memory crash

Oh no, I don’t know

Then I’ll maybe break out that old rock and roll
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

There's a little cotton dress hangin' in my sisters closet
I think I'm gonna borrow it and wear it this weekend
Painted my toes, bought some cherry lip gloss
No rose, no daisy, touch what I got
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
[Bridge]
I'm just a girl who needs a little sun, a little rain
An open field to play
[Chorus]
Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower
I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine
Soakin' up the way of life I was raised in
Runnin' barefoot, bloomin' in a summer shower
Ponytail dancin', I can't help it, I'm a wildflower

810,978,ThisDarius Rucker,"[Verse 1]
Got a baby girl sleeping in my bedroom
And her mama laughing in my arms
There's the sound of rain on the rooftop
And the game's about to start
[Verse 2]
I don't really know how I got here
But I'm sure glad that I did
And it's crazy to think that one little thing
Could've changed all of it
Maybe it didn't turn out like I planned
Maybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man
[Chorus]
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to
This
[Verse 3]
Like the girl that I loved in high school
Who said she could do better
Or that college I wanted to go to
Till I got that letter
[Verse 4]
All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought I'd never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All lead me here to you
I didn't understand it way back when
But sitting here right now it all makes perfect sense
[Chorus]
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this
[Bridge]
How I cried when my mama passed away
But now I've got an angel looking out for me today
So nothing's a mistake
[Chorus]
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

It led me here to
This

812,981,Are You Gonna Kiss Me Or NotThompson Square,"[Verse 1]
We were sitting up there on your momma's roof
Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move
[Verse 2]
Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me
[Chorus]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?
[Verse 3]
It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand
[Verse 4]
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
[Chorus]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

[Keifer & Shawna]
So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
[Keifer]
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle
[Verse 6]
[Keifer & Shawna]
When the preacher man said, ""Say I do""
I did and you did too
[Keifer]
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
[Chorus]
Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Ain't it funny how some things take you back
And the here and now just fades to black
When I pulled that blue tarp off that time machine
Man, it hits me
Seventeen years old runnin' on dumb luck
Spent the whole darn summer livin' in that truck
Them old tires still covered in all that mud
Like it sticks with me in my blood
[Chorus]
When life was nothing more than living for the night
Just try'na steal a kiss on the tailgate of that ride
Good ole days don't wash away, just like that Georgia clay
[Verse 2]
Only one of my friends with a fake ID
It made me the hometown celebrity
Used to put her in park in a vacant lot
Yeah still can't believe we never got caught

When life was nothing more than living for the night
Just try'na steal a kiss on the tailgate of that ride
Good ole days don't wash away, just like that Georgia clay
All over everything
Every last memory
Man it's all comin' back to me
Ain't it funny how some things take you back

When life was nothing more than living for the night

Every last memory
It's all comin' back to me

Woke up late today and I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger
[Verse 1]
Riding in the car to work and I'm
Trying to ignore the hurt so I
Turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute
But then I changed it
I'm getting a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger
[Chorus]
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

It doesn't happen overnight but you
Turn around and a month's gone by
And you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy getting stronger

And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around

But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

I'm better off without you baby
How does it feel without me baby?
I'm getting stronger without you baby

Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around

I can love you in the mornin'
I can love you all day
I can love you even more when I get home
I can love you every second
To the ends of the earth
Where needing you's the only thing that's on
My broken one track mind
[Chorus]
Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back

I could write a thousand letters
Call a hundred times a day
Or try to drown my sorrow at the bar
I could go down to the church
Get on my knees and pray
But it still won't change the way things really are
Won't bring you back again

Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back

Sweetest soul you ever could meet
I bring her morning coffee every day

She calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me

She talks about the clothes
On the line in summer air
Christmas morning
And Thanksgiving prayer
And stories of a family
That I never had
Well sometimes I find myself
Wishing I'd been there

She calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home

There's a small white cross in Arlington
Reads Raymond Davis, '71
Until she can see his face again
I'm going to fill in the best I can

Tells me get washed up for supper

Making yourself a list of the things you wish you didn't say
Sitting by the phone hoping it's gonna ring

Tell me that you're only barely getting by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name

There's a slow moon rising
It's shining on your skin
The way your body moves me
I know there's no holding back
No holding back

I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you
Was anything I could resist

Where love doesn't exist

As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me
Tells me there's no holding back
No holding back

She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane
[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

I ain't the kind you take home to mama
I ain't the kind to wear no ring

Sometimes I smoke cigarettes
The Christian folks say I should quit it
And I just smile and say, ""God Bless""

And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet he'd understand a heart like mine

But said he loved me anyway
My brother got the brains of the family
So I thought I'd learn to sing

Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate
Spilled hot coffee, down the front of my jeans
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent
Not a minute left for me to be me
Been going like nothing can wait
I got to get my priorities straight

Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found
Maybe Ms. Wonderful, I haven't met yet
It just hit me like a wrecking ball
She's giving me a wake up call

Step out in the sunshine

I loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
I smiled and just knew it

And no one ever heard my song
Now it's climbing with a bullet
It's nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when it's said and done girl I hope you know that
[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you
[Chorus]
Oh Without you yea yea
[Verse 2]
Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did
And people that I barely knew
They love me because I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure
How two souls could be miles from one another
But still you and me somehow found each other
[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you
[Chorus]
Oh Without you yea yea
[Verse 3]
Without you I'd survive
But I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions
[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you
[Chorus]
Without you
Without you baby baby baby without you
Without you

830,1011,You LieThe Band Perry,"[Verse 1]
It ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow, but baby, I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes and tell me that you're sorry
Well, you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie
[Chorus]
You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
[Verse 2]
That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys and baby, I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous?
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service
Well, my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire, like a piece of wire
The way you lie
[Chorus]
You lie like the man with the slick back hair who sold me that Ford
Well, you lie like the pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
[Bridge]
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive to the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm not gonna cry, well, maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
Give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down, down, down
And there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around
[Chorus]
Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well, it's what you do, it's who you are

831,1012,TomorrowChris Young,"[Verse 1]
Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head
Telling me that we're no good
[Chorus]
But, tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
[Verse 2]
Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up
When my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop
No matter how bad I want to
[Chorus]
But, tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow
[Bridge]
Baby, when we're good, you know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
That there's anything worth trying to save
[Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
[Outro]
Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here
Yeah, I'm gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would

832,1013,If Heaven Wasn't So Far AwayJustin Moore,"[Verse 1]
Every day I drive to work across Flint River Bridge
A hundred yards from the spot
Where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand
On the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peeling peaches
If it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him
[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away
[Verse 2]
I'd hug all three of those girls
We lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo
And take him hunting one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of
""Me and Bobby McGee""
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile
[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far
[Outro]
If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far away
So far away
So far away
"
833,1014,If I Were A BoyReba,"[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
I'd drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Because they'd stick up for me
[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I would understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Because I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, oh, to come home
[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I would understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a - a better man
And I'd listen to her
Because I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Because he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
[Chorus]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
How it feels to love a girl -
Someday you'll wish you were a - a better man
Oh, you don't listen to her
And you don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
[Outro]
But you're just a boy
"
834,1016,MeanTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
[Breakdown]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
"
835,1017,Somewhere ElseTo,"[Verse 1]
I walk downtown in my broke down shoes
To the side street pub with the bar band blues
Take a backseat at the front door table
Order me a Bud and a shot of Black Label
Closed this place down once again
Sitting here wishing you would walk right in
Down my shot, shoot my beer
I have to got to go home but I cannot stay here
It is a short, short walk down to my second home
But that boulevard gets longer when you are walking back alone
[Pre-Chorus]
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you
[Chorus]
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else
[Verse 2]
Kicking off my shoes, tumbling through the front door
Knowing too well the kind of night I am in for
Cubs got beat again on Sports Center
My bedroom is cold as my TV dinner
One more cigarette and I will kill the light
And I will lay there wishing you were sleeping at my side
[Pre-Chorus]
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you
[Chorus]
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else
[Pre-Chorus]
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you
[Chorus]
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else

Ah, somewhere else
You might end up somewhere else
Somewhere else

836,1018,Old AlabamaBrad Paisley,"[Verse 1]
She’d rather wear a pair of cutoff jeans
Than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, she’s a hot southern mess
She’ll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night
[Chorus]
Is listening to old Alabama, driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
And she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee!
[Verse 2]
And now we’re rolling down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In Mother Nature’s band
[Chorus]
Now we’re listening to old Alabama
Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And It’s Love In The First Degree-ee-Eee!
[Verse 3]
Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some old Righteous Brothers song
And Barry White is not going to work tonight
If you really want to turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that’s where music has to start
[Chorus]
Now we’re listening to Old Alabama
And we’re driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And its Love in the First Degree
Yeah’ you know we’re listening to Old Alabama (old Alabama) driving through Tennessee (Tennessee)
A little Why Lady Why at The Right Time of The Night
Oh and she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee
[Outro]
Oh, play me some old Alabama
Oh, play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play me some old Alabama
Play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play-ee-ay-ay
Yeee-haw!!!

837,1020,HomeboyEric Church,"[Verse 1]
You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
Before you took off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you can't fool me
We both know who you are
[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
[Verse 2]
I was haulin' this hay, to Uncle Joe's farm
I thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death
[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
Come on home, boy
[Bridge]
Homeboy... Yeah...
You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind
I wish you'd come on back and make it all right
Before they're called...home, boy

Come on home, boy

Come on home, boy

And I know you don't think we can carry it on
Baby, I think we both know
It's gone bad, bad, bad
Think of all the good times we had
Driving to your house
'Member when we first met
Dancing on a friday night
Under the moonlight
Talking 'til the night was gone
In the back of my truck with the radio on

Then that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
When that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
That old country song

Baby, I think we both know
It's alright, alright
But how could I forget what you did that night
Baby, you told me you loved me in Tennessee
Where we were gonna live
But now you've done a few things that I can't forgive
Driving to her house
Tellin' her you love her
Lying on a friday night
Ring in your pocket
Lying to me all along
In the back of your truck with the radio on

Then that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
I know we went wrong but we belong
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Who'd-a guessed that Aqua Net
Could start a fire with a single cigarette
No, she wasn't drunk, she wasn't stoned
Just sick and tired of wondering if he was coming home
So she drove around, she found his car
They heard the boom from in the bar
He called the cops, she called his bluff
They hauled her off in high heels and handcuffs

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden 'til they're pushed off the deep end
Oh yeah, God forgive 'em, they weren't born like this

Borderline bipolar, witch with PMS

He don't know why they always seem to pick him

Keep their crazy hidden 'til they're pushed off the deep end
Oh yeah, God forgive 'em, they weren't born like this

And boy, if you feel the fire, you better bet she's got a match
It might be the teacher just down the street
The hairdresser or the housewife or the waitress that's so sweet
No, you won't see it when you meet 'em
So be careful how you treat 'em
She might look just like me

Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

[Bridge]
Now dance like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines, yea
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do
[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww
[Chorus]
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Girl, I been thinking 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff

Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms
I could have said ""I love you""
Could have wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart

Well it was friday in the p.m
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man willy said I like to really
But idol's on tv
And ray had a date
With his wife and Nate quit drinking
But he didn't tell me
[Chorus]
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
[Verse 2]
Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock and roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled who wants to dance and fired up the band with with a franklin and a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
""What's it gonna be
Are you gonna let me to party alone?""

847,1037,Dirt Road AnthemJason Aldean,"[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing
[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
[Verse 2]
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends
[Chorus]
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride
Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

848,1038,Just FishinTrace Adkins,"[Verse 1]
I’m lost in her there holding that pink rod and reel
She’s doing almost everything but sitting still
Talking about her ballet shoes and training wheels
And her kittens
And she thinks we’re just fishing
I say, “Daddy loves you, baby” one more time
She says, “I know. I think I got a bite.”
And all this laughing, crying, smiling dying here inside’s
What I call, living
[Chorus]
And she thinks we’re just fishing on the riverside
Throwing back what we could fry
Drowning worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin’
[Verse 2]
She’s already pretty, like her mama is
Going to drive the boys all crazy
Give her daddy fits
And I better do this every chance I get
Because time is ticking
(Yeah it is)
[Chorus]
And she thinks we’re just fishing on the riverside
Throwing back what we could fry
Drowning worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishing
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishing
Yeah, aww, she thinks we’re just fishing
We aren’t only fishing

849,1039,Barefoot Blue Jean NightJake Owen,"[Verse 1]
A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side
[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night
[Verse 2]
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

850,1040,Knee DeepZac Brown Band,"[Verse 1]
Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
[Chorus]
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
[Verse 2]
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away
[Chorus]
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
[Bridge]
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be
[Chorus]
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise

851,1041,Country Must Be Country WideBrantley Gilbert,"[Verse 1]
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working spitting hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasing up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile
[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
[Verse 2]
It ain't where
It's how you live
We weren't raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And all Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive
[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

853,1045,Love Done GoneBilly Currington,"[Verse 1]
Don't worry, baby, sometimes things change
Nothing we can do about it now, no way
This doesn't come easy, but that's just life
We can't keep pretending everything's alright
We told each other it was love before
The simple truth is it just ain't no more
The bells stop ringing, the music won't play
The crazy little feeling that's faded away
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like a red kite lost in a blue sky wind
I don't know where the good times end when
[Chorus]
It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone
[Verse 2]
I don't regret a single thing that we did
Anytime together, we ever spent
I wouldn't change a thing, baby, you know
Sometimes we got to just go with the flow
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like money in a slot machine
Don't know what happened to you and me
[Chorus]
It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone

Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive

High above the lights of town

I am not gonna lay around and whine and moan for somebody that done me wrong

I believe it's half full not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone ""He left nothing behind""
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
[Verse 2]
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do but I like to do just what I like
I take the chance, dance the dance, it might be wrong but then again it might be right
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything
[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine

If I could, I would

I can’t sleep
There is no sleep coming
I’m just lying here thinking about you
I’m in deep
Falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything we’re going to do
Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Want to jump in my car, go wherever you are
Because I need you by my side
[Chorus]
It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down
[Verse 2]
I want to see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinning like these wheels in my head tonight

It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

The only place that I want to be is where you are
Because anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far

It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

I swear it’s like you’re waiting for the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down
Hey, yeah
Oh, I’m loving thinking about you

A crop's got rain, dirt and sun, to make 'em grow
A song's got rhyme
A clock's got time
You got me and

Baby I got you

Today I wanted to write a tune
Started strummin' this little groove
I could've wrote about love, or money, something sad, or something funny
[Chorus]
But hey, hey, hey what's so wrong with one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song
[Verse 2]
And if by chance this brings you cheer maybe someday you'll bring me a beer
Or not to mention my favorite drink a marga-daiquiri-screw-aloda-on the beach

Hey, hey, hey what's so wrong with one more drinkin' song?
Hold up your cups and sing along to one more drinkin' song

Buyin' shots and pick up lines
And here's to bartenders tryin' to get paid
When all of us are tryin' to get ---

863,1057,I Got NothinDarius Rucker,"[Verse 1]
It's my third cup of coffee
Fifth time I've said I'm sorry
The sun slowly peeking through the glass
Says we been up all night
We both know where this is going
It's been a long time coming
Is it really over, is this really goodbye
Maybe I should say something
Maybe you'd change your mind
Maybe, maybe buy a little more time
[Chorus]
But I got nothing'
No magic words
To stop your leaving'
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm just staring into space
Praying please, please let me think of something
Cause I got nothing'
[Verse 2]
I watch you pack your things
You look down at your ring
You slowly slip it off and then
You lay it on our bed
Maybe I should pick it up
And get down on my knees
Tell you what you wanna hear
And give you what you need
[Chorus]
But I got nothing'
No magic words
To stop your leaving'
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm just staring into space
Praying please, please let me think of something
Cause I got nothing'

You're almost at the door
And you stop and turn around
Your eyes are begging me
Please say something right now

No magic words
To stop your leaving'
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm just staring into space
Praying please, please let me think of something

864,1058,Cost Of LivinRonnie Dunn,"[Verse 1]
Everything to know about me
Is written on this page
A number you can reach me
My social and my age
Yes, I served in the army
It's where I learned to shoot
Eighteen months in the desert
Pourin' sand out of my boots
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I've never been convicted of a crime
I could start this job at any time
[Chorus]
I got a strong back, steel toes, rarely call in sick
A good truck, what I don't know I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays
Give you forty and then some, whatever it takes
[Post-Chorus]
Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up
[Verse 2]
I put Robert down as a reference
He's known me all my life
We attend the same church
He introduced me to my wife
Gave my last job everything
Before it headed south
Took the shoes off of my children's feet
The food out of their mouths
Yesterday my folks offered to help
But they're barely gettin' by themselves
[Chorus]
I got a strong back, steel toes, rarely call in sick
A good truck, what I don't know I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays
Give you forty and then some, whatever it takes
[Post-Chorus]
Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up
[Bridge]
I'm sure a hundred others have applied
Rumor has it you're only takin' five
[Chorus 2]
I got a strong back, steel toes, I'm handy with a wrench
There's nothin' I can't drive, nothin' I can't fix
I work sunup to sundown
Ain't too proud to sweep the floors
Bank has started callin'
And the wolves are at my door
Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up

865,1059,God Gave Me YouBlake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain’t who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you
[Chorus]
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you
[Verse 2]
There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!
[Chorus]
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
[Verse 3]
On my own, I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo
[Chorus]
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
He gave me you

866,1061,Sparks FlyTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of
[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I wanted lace, I wanted pearls, to be a princess like
The other girls
But life came hard, to my front door
And I grew up trying
To even out the score
Tough, I ain't never been nothing but tough, all my edges have
Always been rough
[Chorus 1]
But Jesus loves me anyway
Oh backbone, there ain't nothing wrong with a woman that
Got a little backbone

You just wait 'til you taste her kind of love
You want a shy little thing, a pretty little high heel thing
Going to cry if I don't polish up
Tough

The way I see it, the hand of fate, did me a favor, with
The cards he dealt my way
Found out real fast, life is a game
You're out real quick if you don't know how to play, tough

All my edges have always been rough

But Jesus loves me anyway
Oh backbone, there ain't nothing wrong with a woman that

Are you serious? You ain't fooled me much
You just a hanging round
So you can try your luck
Well tough, I ain't never been nothing but tough
All my edges has always been rough

Going to cry if I don't polish up
You know what I got to say about that is tough

Well I drove down to the ocean
Left my heartache way behind
But the rain won't leave and the pain won't ease
And the sun don't wanna shine
So I ordered me up a killer
Found a view out across the sea
I sat down in the sand
A drink in my hand
And in the glass looking back at me
[Chorus]
I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go
Yeah, I got a long, long way to go
[Verse 2]
Well I met an old boy from Georgia
Yeah, his woman done knocked him down
I asked him how's he doing
He stared at me confused
And said, ""Hey, ain't you looked around?""
He said the rain won't leave
And the pain won't ease
And the sun don't wanna shine
And there's something in the bottom of this drink I just got
And it don't look like a worm to me

I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go
Yeah, I got a long, long way to go

So we put our drinks together
And toasted rainy weather
And the women that had done us wrong
Then we threw back margaritas
The bug just made it sweeter
And we both sang a happy song
[Chorus][x3]
Yeah, I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I got a woman I'm tryin' to drink away
And I got a long, long way to go

Everybody's reaching for something
Every day, pulling and tugging
And always wanting a little more
Holding onto hurt like an anchor
Treating those we love like strangers
Taking names and keeping score
We all know what we're really after
Somewhere along the road, we got it backwards
[Chorus]
If you want to get love then give it
If you want to feel some forgiveness
Then you gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own
If you want a friend then be one
A little bit of kindness, show some
You'll be surprised at how much finds its way back home
It don't matter what it is
If you want it, give

I been downright stubborn
At one time or another
And found it easier to bend
I've had a shoulder to lean on
Been the one who got to be strong
And peace was waiting at both ends
I've felt the power, I've seen what it can do
It seemed so simple, so simple that it's true

If you want to get love then give it
If you want to feel some forgiveness
Then you gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own

I drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt
I'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself

At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found

Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Guess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's going to be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beating
Nobody's going to see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

Blowing every dollar I ever made
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me
'Cause I sure lost a lot of weight
Tell 'em I'm out on the road
With some old rock and roll band
Living like a gypsy can
[Chorus]
Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth
[Bridge]
The truth is that I'm asking you to lie
And we both know that it ain't right
But if you ever loved me
Please have some mercy on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth
I still need you
[Outro]
Yeah, that's the truth
I still love you
Baby, that's the truth

880,1086,That's How Country Boys RollBilly Currington,"[Verse 1]
They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll
[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll
[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
[Outro]
Aw come on now
Yeah they're crying aloud
Humble and proud
They love moma and Jesus and Jones
That's how country boys roll
Don't you know

881,1087,Hillbilly BoneBlake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
Oh man, you've got to watch where you're steppin' around here
Yeah, I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Conway Twitty
Don't know nothin' 'bout grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonkin' and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud
[Chorus]
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just gettin' on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
[Verse 2]
Nah, you ain’t gotta be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
Yeah, bubba, all you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you got to let it shine
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Come on, come on, come on
You ain't alone, you ain't alone
[Chorus]
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin' Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that it's in them genes
Ain’t nothin' wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone

[Chorus]
Come on y'all
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide

You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man, you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just getting on your

882,1088,Temporary HomeCarrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face
[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home
[Verse 2]
Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night, she whispers to her baby girl
""Someday we'll find our place here in this world""
[Chorus]
This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home
[Verse 3]
Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, ""Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday""
He looks up and says, ""I can see God's face""
[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

This is our temporary home

Got the news on Friday morning
But a tear I couldn't find
You showed me how I am supposed to live
Now you showed me how to die
I was lost til Sunday morning
I woke up to face my fear
While writing you this good bye song I found a tear
[Chorus]
I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend

So play it sweet in heaven

I'm not crying' cause I feel so sorry for you
I am crying' for me

I got up and dialed your number
Your voice came on the line
That old familiar message
I have heard a thousand times
It just said, sorry that I missed you
Leave a message and god bless
I know that you think I am crazy
But I just had to hear your voice I guess

I'm going to miss that smile

Backward bass guitar
I'll see you on the other side superstar

I'm going to miss you my friend

884,1090,A Little More Country Than ThatEaston Corbin,"[Verse 1]
Imagine a dirt road full of potholes
With a creek bank and some cane poles catching channel cat
I'm a little more country than that
Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the courthouse
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that
[Chorus]
I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm I'm not the kind to two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
[Verse 2]
Think of a Hank song from days gone
With a steel rod that's so strong,  sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that
[Chorus]
I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm  not the kind to two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that

Yeah, I'm sure that you've heard those three words from lovers but they fell flat
But this ring ain't something that I mean to give you and then take back

[Verse 1]
Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight
[Chorus]
But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'til summer comes around
[Verse 2]
I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days 'tell you just might come back
[Chorus]
But then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
Till summer comes around
[Chorus]
Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on a Ferris wheel rocking with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment
And ""Baby I'll be back again"" you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
'til summer comes around

'til summer comes around yeah
Mmm...
'til it comes around, 'til it comes around

I ride east every other Friday but if I had it my way
The day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son, there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along
[Chorus]
So I'll drive
And I think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride
[Verse 2]
A day might come and you'll realize that if you could see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don't mistake me for a man that didn't care at all
[Chorus]
And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride
[Outro]
So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride

And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah

Like I was all you'd ever need

890,1096,Ain't Back YetKenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
I heard a song about a rambling man
Bought a guitar and I started a band
I got a gig at the local Am Vet
I was gone and I am not back yet
69 bored, out and jacked up
A quarter mile that was all it was
I burned the cool off of that Corvette
And I was gone and I am not back yet

Looking back at the moments, black and white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever

Man, we were matches and gasoline
First taste of love never will forget
I was gone and I am not back yet
I was gone, gone and I am not back yet

Looking back at the moments, black white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever
The laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears
It's hard to hate what got me here
What got me here

She was a straight out of Hollywood smile
We missed it all by a country mile
Went out one night for some cigarettes
And I was gone and I am not back yet

I was gone and I am not back
I am not back, am not back yet

Walked down the road a little sideways
Cracked a brick when you hit the wall

Pull you down faster than a sunset
Hey, it happens to us all
When the cold, hard rain just won't quit
And you can't see your way out of it

You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken

Love, it can weather any storm

As you think that there's no way out

You know how to get hip to my heart

898,1109,StillTim McGraw,"[Chorus]
There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still
[Verse 1]
There's the place I love to be
Momma daddy my sister & me
First time I ever saw the beach back to 1983
All I really have to do is just be still
When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes no matter where I am
And just be still
[Chorus]
There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still
[Bridge]
When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes
No matter where I am
And just be still
[Chorus]
There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still

899,1111,I Keep On Loving YouReba,"[Verse 1]
Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the Good Book says
You got to play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you got to go without knowing where you're going
[Chorus]
That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you
[Verse 2]
Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some of baby-I'm-gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel
Someday we're going to look back
Say look at us now
[Chorus]
That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you
[Outro]
Keep on loving you
Through the I-take-it-backs, I-didn't-mean-it-like-that
I'd-never-hurt-yous
Oh, I keep on loving you
Keep on loving you
Through the I-take-it-backs, I-didn't-mean-it-like-that
I'd-never-hurt-yous
Oh, I keep on loving you

900,1112,Rain Is A Good ThingLuke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing
[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
[Verse 2]
Aren’t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing
[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
[Bridge]
Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playing in a big mud puddle
[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
[Outro]
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing

901,1118,The CallMatt Kennon,"[Verse 1]
Today was gonna be the day
He'd already wrote the note
And parked that Chevrolet
At the end of that dead end road
Had his finger on the trigger
Just about to end everything
He was taking one last long breathe
When he heard his cell phone ring
[Chorus]
And his best friend said man where you been?
We're headed down to the lake this weekend
You better not miss it 'cause buddy I swear
It won't be the same If you ain't there
And I told that girl that you like so much
You were coming along and her eyes lit up
I better let you go, man
I really hope I didn't catch you in the middle of anything
He said you kinda did but I don't mind at all
I'm glad you called
[Verse 2]
In another town down the road
In the backseat of a car
Two 18-year-olds had let a kiss go top far
He said how are we gonna have this child
When were both headed off to school?
He convinced her late one night there's only one thing to do
She was scared to death in that waiting room
When the nurse asked how far along are you
She said five weeks and just about then
Her phone lit up and his call came in
[Chorus]
Saying baby I was wrong about everything
I've already bought you a diamond ring
We're gonna start a life, would you be my wife?
Boy or girl; pink or blue; yeah either way
All she could say as she felt those teardrops fall
I'm so glad you called
[Outro]
If someone you know is weighing on your mind
And needs a friend on the end of that other line
Don't hesitate what you say may seem so small
But who knows? They might be glad you called
So make the call, yeah make that call
"
902,1120,Turning HomeDavid Nail,"[Verse 1]
Usually take one last pass through town
Stop the car and touch the ground
Watch those streetlights swayin' in the breeze
Decorated store fronts
Rusty old gas pumps
Try to fill my mind up
With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company
[Chorus]
I don't know no town like the old town
Even when the miles are many, I feel like I'm still around
Deep inside me like rings through an oak tree
Yeah, there somethin' 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turnin' home
[Verse 2]
I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I can't re-live
Stories I'll never forget
[Chorus]
And I don't know no friends like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now like I did with them
But deep inside me a piece of history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
And it keeps me turnin' home
[Verse 3]
Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent
[Chorus]
And I don't know no love like the first love
When I think about the best times she's the one I think of
Deep inside me all though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
And it keeps me turning home, yeah

903,1121,Stay Here ForeverJewel,"[Verse 1]
I'm staring at the ceiling, laying here dreaming
Wasting the day away
The world's flying by our window outside
But hey baby that's okay
This feels so right, it can't be wrong so far as I can see
Where you wanna go
Baby, I'll do anything
[Chorus]
'Cause if you wanna go
Baby, let's go
If you wanna rock
I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss
Have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can stay here forever
Lay here forever, oh
[Verse 2]
If you want to see that Italian tower leaning
Baby, we can leave right now
If that's too far, we can head in the car
And take a little trip around town
They say that California is nice and warm this time of year
Baby, say the word and we'll just disappear
[Chorus]
'Cause if you wanna go
Baby, let's go
If you wanna rock
I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss
Have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever, oh
[Bridge]
Take me for a whirl
Just a boy and a girl
Letting go of it all
Holding on to one another
Or there's a whole world to discover
Right here, under the covers
[Chorus]
'Cause if you wanna go
Baby, let's go
If you wanna rock
I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together
If you wanna walk
Baby, let's walk
Have a little kiss
Have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can stay here forever
Lay here forever, oh
Let's stay here forever, oh

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet

You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow,  that's right
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade
[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
[Verse]
Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

[You make me smile like the sun]
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night]

Forget how to breathe

Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Roll into town, step off the bus
Shake off the where you came from dust
Grab your guitar, walk down the street
Sign says ""Nashville, Tennessee""
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I have found
[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town
[Verse 2]
You pay your dues and you play for free
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny
You cut your teeth in the smokey bars
And live off the tips from a pickle jar
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Til you find a cool new sound
And you smile when the record man shoots you down
[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town
[Bridge]
One year they repossess your truck
And the next you make a couple million bucks
[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
We love it, we hate it, we all came here to make it
In this crazy town
It's a crazy town

908,1132,The House That Built MeMiranda Lambert,"[Verse 1]
I know they say ""You can’t go home again""
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard
[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me
[Verse 2]
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream
[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me
[Bridge]
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am
[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

I was hanging' out a last night at the top cat when the band slowed down to Merle
Man I hit it 'cross the bar room trying to find my baby girl
Some drunk tried to punk me, and ask my baby ""do you dance"" she said ""yes I do, but not with you, I'm waiting' on my man""

Well I flipped her around and I kissed her and she said lets do one more

910,1135,WaterBrad Paisley,"[Verse 1]
Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old
Splashing everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water
On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And you’re a big old wuss
If you don't jump in
The water
[Chorus]
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old igloo
Drive until the map turns blue
[Verse 2]
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water
Oh let her go boys
[Chorus]
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you want to see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue
[Verse 3]
You can stay right there
When the daylights gone
Play truth or dare
And it won’t take long
'Fore you and her got nothing on
But water
All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water

Far too long, far too long
Say you'll buy me a shiny ring
But your words don't mean a thing
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy

Till you take me down (take me down)

Charming devil, silver tongue
Had your fun, now you're done

No more chicken and gravy
Ain't gonna have your baby!

Take me down to the little white church, take me down

912,1140,Get Off On The PainGary Allan,"[Verse 1]
I don't know why I love women
That love to do me wrong
I don't know why my life sounds like
A heartbroke country song
I ain't really happy
Until the sky starts driving rain
Maybe I just get off on the pain
My whole life I been picking fights
There ain't no way to win
There's a hundred scars and shoulda-run-aways
Now tattooed on my skin
There's a side of me that just won't stop
Dancin' in the flame
Maybe I just get off on the pain
[Chorus]
'Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road
Just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain
[Verse 2]
I wake up every morning
A thousand miles from home
Praying for forgiveness
For this aching in my bones
It would be so easy
To find a better way
Oh, but I know I'll never change
[Chorus]
'Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road
Just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain
'Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
I know I'm the only one to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

Baby I'm on my way to come and get you, meet me at the end of your drive
Grab your shades and your string bikini and your Coppertone 45
[Chorus]
Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good times, girl let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet, honey let your hair down too
I know a spot down on the river, underneath the Sycamore tree
Save all your kisses, but bring on your sweet love, pour it all over me
All over me
[Verse 2]
We can build us a fire when we run out of daylight, let it light up your face
Lay on a blanket, listen to the river, get a little carried away
Well I can take a side kiss on your sweet lips, ain't going to want it to end
So when the morning comes, we'll roll on out, and do it all over again

Come on

There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change

All the stars keep on falling around us
We were almost broken
Holding on as we felt our worlds collide, collide
Sometimes all the answers, baby, are right outside your door
Sometimes all we need is a little time, time
[Chorus]
There’s no going back to the start again

The world is ours tonight
The only thing I have is everything to lose
I would lay it on the line for you
To be here by my side
The world is ours tonight

Turn the pages, we’ll write another chapter
Be the last one standing
Burn those bridges down and we’ll never go back, no

We’ve just gotta try
I refuse to walk away this time, this time

There’s no going back to the start again
Time will tell us how the story ends

We drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just me and you
Lay underneath the harvest moon
Do all the things that lovers do
Just me and you

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

No we don't have a lot of money

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you

Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this I gave you that
It's scary business
Your heart and soul is on the line
Baby why else would I be standing round here so tongue-tied
[Chorus]
If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in, I'm in
[Verse 2]
Baby come on in the water's fine
I'll be right here you take your time
Just let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith
It's like I told you there's no guarantees when you feel this way

If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic

Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in
[Bridge]
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am

I wasn't born for digging deep holes
I'm not made for paving long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer
[Verse 2]
I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slapping on paint
Don't have a knack for making motors crank, no
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer

So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my Bud Light

Here we go!
[Verse 1]
You wear your smile like a summer sky
Just shining down on me and you
I swear your heart is a free bird
On a lazy Sunday afternoon
I love the way that you were up for anything
Never worried 'bout what people say
That's right, oh, that's right
What we got is

Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always tryin' to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love
Mmm, that's our kind of love

Skipping rocks and leaving footprints
Down along the riverbank
Always holding hands, never making plans

920,1157,Roll With ItEaston Corbin,"[Verse 1]
I got my old guitar and some fishing poles
So baby fill that cooler full of something cold
Don't ask, just pack and we'll hit the road runnin
Honey what do you say?
I got just enough money and just enough gas
So pick a place on the map we can get to fast
Where the white sandy beach meets water like glass
And if the tide carries us away
[Chorus]
Baby we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinkin' low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby let's roll with it
[Verse 2]
We get so caught up in catchin' up
Trying to pay the rent, tryna to make a buck
That don't leave much time for time for us
And ain't life too short for that?
So open up that bag of pig skins you bought
At the Exxon station the last time we stopped
And you kick back baby and dance in your socks
On the windshield to some radio rock
[Chorus]
And we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinkin' low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And it won't be no thing if it starts to rain
And we have to wait it out in the truck
We might wind up a little deeper in love
So baby let's roll with it
Baby let's roll with
Baby we'll roll with it
Baby we'll roll with it

I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it... pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain

Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving

And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on

Lace-up boots and faded jeans
A homemade sandwich, a half jug of tea
Average Joe, average pay
Same ol' end and same ol' day
[Chorus]
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man

All week long making a living
Life keeps takin', he keeps giving
Behind the scene, below the grade
Hardly noticed but part of everything
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
He gives his life then fades away
Another young man takes his place
Average Joe, average pay
Same ol end, same old' day

But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
No, there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer

Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man

Let's blow out these city lights
Let's just leave it all behind
Get up where the air is still
You can hear the whippoorwill
Start a fire, pass the 'shine
Won't be home 'til morning time
Shout your name out in the wind
Confess my love for you again
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
[Verse 2]
Hey, now, honey child
We'd be running free and wild
No one care what you do
Ain't no law to answer to
Dance around in the dirt
Listen to them crickets chirp
Hear old Jake start to howl
When he hears that old hoot owl
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge

Come on, girl, it's almost dawn
Let's get it 'fore the magic's gone
Tall, tall grass all around
Come on lay that blanket down
Wild flowers just like you
Lay on me like morning dew
Now take my hand walk with me
Sun come up through them trees
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
I just want one little kiss

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, Oh-ho
[Verse 1]
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
[Verse 2]
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
[Pre-Bridge]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
[Bridge]
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls

My neighbor Carl, he lives next door
Pink flamingos on his porch
At night he teaches driving school
And he sits out by his plastic pool
He takes off his shirt he opens up a cold one
Old Carls he's a fool but it takes one to know one

Music is playing up and down the block
Mostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock
It's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods
There is always something going on down in the trailerhood

Across the street there is gambling Jane who is always got the poker game
If you care to try your luck you can buy a seat for 15 bucks
You can call to raise or you can check and fold them
I like five card stud but it is mostly Texas hold 'em

Mostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock
It's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods
There is always something going on down in the trailerhood

Dallas Cowboy football on TV
When the storm starts getting bad, you hear the those sirens humming
Grab a six pack and a lawn chair there is a tornado coming

Mostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock
It's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods

There is a party going on down in the trailerhood

I rolled my daddy's truck off the Dixonville curve after drinking my fifth beer
And I fed hogs trying to pay him off for most of my senior year
I got my jaw jacked by a big ole boy for messing 'round with his girlfriend
But she was tall and tan and she kissed just right but I'll never do that again
[Chorus]
Yeah, I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way
[Verse 2]
I've been kicked in the face by horse cause I ran up too fast behind him
And I shook hands on a deal with a man, and found out he was lying
I've broken a couple good girls hearts cause I said I loved em knowing I couldn't
An I've given my heart to a woman who said she'd stay, when I knew she wouldn't

Yeah, I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

I'm a little bit harder and whole lot smarter

When you first said my name, I didn't feel a thing
No, not me, my heart didn't skip a beat

This ain't no love song
I just felt like getting my guitar on
And singing a tune, singing about you, yeah
Feeling good and tapping my shoes

But then you never know
So baby if you want, you can sing along, but this ain't no love song

I couldn't sleep last night
But you weren't on my mind

But if you saw me driving by
Well, I must have took a wrong turn
I must have been thinking something else
Had a melody in my head
Yeah, maybe that's why I couldn't sleep last night

I got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a Hallmark card
If you wanna pick a fight
Well, I'm gonna to have to say good night
I don't have to be hateful, I can just say bless your heart
And even though I don't belong with your high life friends
Doesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amends
It's easier, can't you see? Let's agree to just disagree
We don't have to like each other, but it's sure fun to pretend

So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
If you just smile and behave, you could always get your way

Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in
Right back in
And I know-oo I'm never letting this go-ooo
I'm stuck on you
Whutooo whutooo
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Whutooo whutooo
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
"
933,1176,MineTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""
[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)

934,1177,Anything Like MeBrad Paisley,"[Verse 1]
I remember saying I don't care either way
Just as long as he or she is healthy I'm OK
Then the doctor pointed to the corner of the screen
And said "" you see that thing right there well you know what that means""
And I started wondering who he was going to be
And I thought heaven help us if he's anything like me
He'll probably climb a tree too tall and ride his bike too fast
End up every summer wearing something in a cast
He's going to throw a ball and break some glass in a window down the street
[Chorus]
He's going to get in trouble oh he's going to get in fights
I'm going to lose my temper and some sleep
It safe to say that I'm going to get my payback if he's anything like me
[Verse 2]
I can see him right now knees all skinned up
With a magnifying glass trying to melt a Tonka truck
Won't he be a sight with his football helmet on
That'll be his first love till his first love comes along
He'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teens
And heaven help him if he's anything like me
He'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast
Get a speeding ticket he'll pay for mowing grass
He's going to get caught skipping class and be grounded for a week
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
He's going to love me and hate me along the way
Years are going to fly by I already dread the day
He's going to hug his momma he's going to shake my hand
He's going to act like he can't wait to leave
But as he drives out he'll cry his eyes out
If he's anything like me
There's worse folks to be like
Aw, he'll be alright
If he's anything like me
"
935,1179,Draw Me A MapDierks Bentley,"[Verse 1]
Staring deep into your eyes
Searching for answers to questions I can't find
If I took for granted that I held your heart
I'd beg forgiveness but I don't know where to start
[Chorus]
Draw me a map that leads me back to you
I don't know where to go, please tell me what to do
Help me find the road you're on
I just need directions home
Draw me a map that leads me back to you
[Verse 2]
I've never been so at loss
I'm at a can yon I can't get around or cross
So baby come down here, lay by my side
And tell me love's not lost across the great divide
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
You're my destiny and destination
Understand my desperation - you
The only place I wanna be
So get us back to you and me
[Chorus]

936,1180,Playing The PartJamey Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Takin' a dip on the Sunset Strip in the mornin'
Ain't nothin' like the smell of tofu and high dollar wine
Except maybe all of them cars lockin' down the I-5
I find it amazin', these rats I've been chasin', are helpin' me remember a time
[Chorus]
When the only L.A. I knew
Was lower Alabama
Back when me and Hannah
Was wishin' on a southern star
Now it's so complicated, I really hate it
Why'd I ever wanna go so far?
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part
[Verse 2]
All this grippin' an' grinnin', an' bluesin' an' winnin' an' runnin'
And promises break like an egg on the hot asphalt
What the hell was I thinkin', drinkin' like I'd never get caught?
These high dollar women and the fame and the fortune, ain't worth the ticket I bought
[Chorus]
When the only LA I knew
Was lower Alabama
Back when me and Hannah
Was wishin' on a southern star
Now it's so complicated, I really hate it
Why'd I ever wanna go so far?
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part
[Outro]
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part
