High, high hopes

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Verse 2]
Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

[Bridge]
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

[Bridge]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)"

Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me

Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

2,Brokenlovelytheband,"[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 1]
I met you late night, at a party
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off

[Pre-Chorus]
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 2]
There's something tragic, but almost pure
Think I could love you, but I'm not sure
There's something wholesome, there's something sweet
Tucked in your eyes that I'd love to meet

[Pre-Chorus]
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Bridge]
Life is not a love song that we like
We're all broken pieces floating by
Life is not a love song we can try
To fix our broken pieces one at a time

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you"
3,Bohemian RhapsodyQueen,"[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters

Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

[Chorus: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""Let me out!""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3: Freddie Mercury]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro: David Bowie]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure"

I saw the part of you
That only when you're older, you will see too
You will see too
I held the better cards
But every stroke of luck has gotta bleed through
It's gotta bleed through

Go forward slowly
It's not a race to the end

Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)

Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar

16,ZeroImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

Looking for the path of the young and lonely

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Looking for the path of the young and lonely

19,Love It If We Made ItThe 1975,"[Verse 1]
We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us

Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

And guess what, you're all invited
And you're famous
Modernity has failed us

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars

Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

Get up, get up
Get up, get up

[Verse 1]
Well, are you ready now for the revolution?
For too long your power has been taken away, it's been taken away
Does your heart feel heavy now? Savor the solution
Take those mental shackles off and throw them away
You've got to get them out of your mind
Don't you let their vision leave you blind

[Verse 2]
Moving steady now, it's a revelation
For so long your focus has been taken away, now you're breaking away
They may think they know you, but here's an education
No, they can't control you once you've broken away
They're done patrolling your mind
When they're searching for you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for

[Chorus]
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong

That's enough already now, you don't wanna take it
All your reservations have been taken away, they've been taken away
So you think you're ready now for the revolution?

You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for

Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong

They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon

They aren't ready for us to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
Let me know you're ready to be turned into people who cannot be preyed upon

I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight

I love them, I love them
These are my friends, these are my friends
I love them, I love them

[Verse 1]
I wish I was a little more loved
Tryna find a way to fix that
So many people inside my head
Momma taught me not to talk back
But they're pretty good company
They cheer me up when I feel bad

That keep me going?

All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

34,MantraBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell ""epiphany""?

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

[Bridge]
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

Now those days are over
And we are all ghosts

We used to sleep all day and talk all night
Stay up by the TV light (Oh, oh)

36,All Out LifeSlipknot,"[Verse 1]
What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

[Chorus]
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

[Verse 2]
Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I gotta know now, you better tell me

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

[Bridge]
We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
""I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever""

No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die

I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool

There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

On videos for hours and hours

How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you, we depend
So, stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

45,Fast TalkHouses,"[Verse 1]
Me and my best friends cruising down West End Street
Hiding from cops and driving circles around the block all week
All of my friends died out on West End Street
They say we're born to die young
But we're just trying to live in peace

[Chorus]
So maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk
So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run

[Verse 2]
All of our friends went crazy on LSD
Sailing their cars through the big bright city streets
And everyone who knows our name
Says that we ain't ever gonna change
They say we're born to die young
But we're trying to find a better way
They say we're born to die young
But we're trying to find a better way

[Chorus]
Maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk
So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run

[Spoken]
Word up?
Hey, what's up, man?
Just sitting around and I'm gonna be 32 years old tomorrow
And I feel half completely alive and half completely dead

[Bridge]
We hope and we pray day after day
They say we're born to die young
But we're gonna find a better way
We hope and we pray day after day
They say we're born to die young
But we're trying to find a better way

[Chorus]
So maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk
So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run"
46,DiseaseBeartooth,"[Intro]
If I fall again, will it be the end?
I know it's wrong, you think I'm strong, but I just pretend
Is it takin' over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Stuck at the surface, not makin' progress
Fallin' apart, well, I'm tryin' my hardest
Lookin' for answers, findin' a rope
Is the noose gettin' tighter? I'm losin' control

[Pre-Chorus]
Will the end make me whole again?

[Chorus]
It's like holdin' on when my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

[Verse 2]
I'm gettin' older, still, lost as ever
Fakin' a smile while I bury the pressure
Why does this happen? I should be fine
But I can't shake the feelin', I'm livin' a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Will the end make me whole again?

[Chorus]
It's like holdin' on when my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

47,Roaring 20sPanic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Verse 2]
Oscars and Emmys and Grammys
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Bridge]
Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feeling me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Here comes the Sunday driver
Came to get my sister
We know you're such a liar
Can't believe I missed her

[Chorus]
It ain't right (Yeah)
It ain't wrong
It's a fact
Sing my song

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know he's gonna spin it
Can't believe she kissed him
He said, ""Give me just a minute
I'm working on a system""

It's a fact, yeah
Sing my song

It ain't wrong
It's a fact
Sing my song

49,Northern LightsDeath Cab For Cutie,"[Verse 1: Benjamin Gibbard]
I remember your silhouette on Dyes Inlet
Against the silver sheen of a moon like painted glass
Under stars out on a pier; a celestial sphere
We were weightless as the waves that disappeared

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard]
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

[Verse 2: Benjamin Gibbard with Lauren Mayberry]
We shared a clove cigarette on the parapet
As the TVs glowed from the windows of the model homes
And I'd never be that close again to your lips and perfect skin
As the tide receded into the unknown

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard & Lauren Mayberry]
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

[Post-Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard]
I remember your silhouette on Dyes Inlet

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard & Lauren Mayberry]
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
Northern lights filled our skies

50,Almost (Sweet Music)Hozier,"[Verse 1]
I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is ""Stella by Starlight""
That was my heart, the drums that start off ""Night and Day""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Verse 2]
Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Bridge]
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't, mmm
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

[Verse 3]
The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, ""Is everything alright?""
And, Lord

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me"
51,Come AlongCosmo Sheldrake,"[Verse 1]
Come along, catch a Heffalump
Sit with me on a muddy clump
We'll sing a song of days gone by
Run along now, don’t be glum
Get you gone, now, have some fun
Don't be long, for the end is nigh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't let moments pass along
And waste before your eyes
March with me and the borogoves
Come with me and the slithy toves
And never ask us why

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

[Bridge]
We'll be here when the world slows down
And the sunbeams fade away
Keeping time by a pendulum
As the fabric starts to fray
There’s no such thing as time to kill
Nor time to throw away
So, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty
Thrice for another day

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

[Verse 2]
Come with me, catch a rare type specimen
Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton
We'll break our fast with friends
Once we're fed, we shall disappear rapidly
Many moons to the west of here and happily
Our journey never ends

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shut your ears when sirens sing,
Tie armbands to your feet
Listen up and you won't go wrong again
Float along on a verse-less song and then
Get to where the two ends meet

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs"
52,Land Of The FreeThe Killers,"[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers & Choir]
Can't wipe the wind-blown smile from across my face
It's just the old man in me
Washing his truck at the Sinclair station
In the land of the free (Ooh)
His mother, Adeline's family, came on a ship
Cut coal and planted a seed
Down in them drift mines of Pennsylvania
In the land of the free

[Chorus: Choir & Brandon Flowers]
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
(I'm standing crying)

[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers & Choir]
When I go out in my car, I don't think twice
But if you're the wrong color skin (I'm standing, crying)
You grow up looking over both your shoulders
In the land of the free
And we got more people locked up than the rest of the world
Right here in red, white and blue (I'm standing, crying)
Incarceration's become big business
It's harvest time out on the avenue

[Chorus: Choir & Brandon Flowers]
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Move on there's nothing to see
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free

[Bridge: Choir]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm standing, crying (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm standing, crying

[Verse 3: Brandon Flowers & Choir]
So how many daughters, tell me, how many sons
Do we have to have to put in the ground
Before we just break down and face it:
We got a problem with guns? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
In the land of the free
Down at the border, they're gonna put up a wall
Concrete and Rebar Steel beams (I'm standing, crying)
High enough to keep all those filthy hands off
Of our hopes and our dreams (I'm standing, crying)
People who just want the same things we do
In the land of the free

[Chorus: Choir & Brandon Flowers]
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
Land of the free, land of the free
In the land of the free (I'm standing, crying)"
53,HurtOliver Tree,"[Intro]
My day will come, I gave too much
I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I only want your dying love, I've seen enough

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

[Verse 1]
I feel left out, I don't see how
My whole life can change in one week
I don't mind my own reflection
I don't see how, you've been let down
Don't speak 'less you have to
Why you always seem in a bad mood?
Your whole life, you had an attitude
One day, is it so bad for you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

[Verse 2]
I changed my whole life when
I learned to ignore them
I changed my whole life up
Maybe it was not enough
I don't think I'm allowed to
Make a deal with your selfish ways
They're acting vicious out there
There's lots of demons out here

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough"

Ten times outta nine, I'm a hand grenade

It’s a red flag before the mayday
Check all of my signs, keep away, I'm warning you, babe

56,Harmony HallVampire Weekend,"[Verse 1]
We took a vow in summertime
Now we find ourselves in late December
I believe that New Year's Eve
Will be the perfect time for their great surrender
But they don't remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

[Chorus]
And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Verse 2]
Within the halls of power lies a nervous heart that beats
Like a Young Pretender's
Beneath these velvet gloves I hide
The shameful, crooked hands of a moneylender
'Cause I still remember

Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified

57,Over My HeadJudah,"[Verse 1]
What's my purpose? Huh? What's my future? I don't know
These are the questions I address before I go to sleep
I wish my mind would turn off with the lights and my TV screen
But here in the dark, everything off, I start to think
It gets hard to breathe

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
All these thoughts are an ocean that I'm drowning in
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head

[Verse 2]
Second guessing, I'm so stressed, success is an empty lie
So what's the point if that's our purpose on Earth by design?
All this stressing got me confessing that I can't find peace
Well, I hydrate, caffeinate, medicate, repeat
I hydrate, caffeinate, medicate, repeat, I

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I
I'm in over my— I'm in over my head

I'm in over my— I'm in over my head

Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
You rained on my heart for far too long (Far too long)
Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause
I can't save you from yourself
When all you give a shit about is everybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you

But you won't admit, why don't you get a grip?
'Cause you can't keep going on and on and on and on like this
And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

You need a taste of your own medicine

Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you

'Cause I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
Yeah, I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood

59,CringeMatt Maeson,"[Verse 1]
Lover, come over, look what I've done
I've been alone so long, I feel like I'm on the run
Lover, come over, kick up the dust
I've got a secret starting to rust

[Chorus]
She said I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, ""I'm just tired,"" she said, ""You're just high""
And I said, ""I saw you in the water""
And I said, ""I saw you in the water""

Lover, come hold me, head's on the fritz
Gaudy intoxicated feelings comfortably mixed
Lover, come hold me, could you forget?
I've got a secret, digging a debt

She said I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, ""I'm just tired,"" she said, ""You're just high""
And I said, ""I saw you in the water""
And I said, ""I saw you in the water""

Sweating all your sins out
Putting all your thoughts back together
Oh, we just don't blend now
All of my attempts seem to weather
Oh, I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?
Oh, I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?

She said I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal

I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been-oh, ooh
The way that things have been-oh, ooh
Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea-oh, ooh
The master of my sea-oh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I was broken from a young age
Takin' my sulkin' to the masses
Writin' my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
Singin' from heartache from the pain
Takin' my message from the veins
Speakin' my lesson from the brain
Seein' the beauty through the...

First things first, can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin''
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
Love you Miss Cita, the son of a leader
I know that bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without, huh
Hold up, hold up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without gain
I know that beauty don't come without
Don't come without…

Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

[Bridge]
And it's by the by
If it makes those nights fly
We're side by side again
And now, we’re all careless and love drunk
You know exactly how it goes
When you’re giving us all kind of reason
Thought I had to go and follow the heart I believe in
'Cause one of us must know
When you're giving us all kind of reason
Thought I had to go and follow the heart I believe in
'Cause in the past it's done me good
So good, so good, so good

[Chorus]
Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of our longshots paid off
Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of our longshots paid off
One of our longshots paid off
One of our longshots paid off"

Floating in outer space, have I misplaced a part of my soul?
Lost in the in-between, or so it seems, I'm out of control
Floating in outer space, have I misplaced a part of my soul?
Lost in the in-between, but it can't keep me asleep for long, 'cause

With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts

[Chorus]
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

[Verse 2]
You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
You gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared

[Chorus]
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them"
74,We Are The Champions (Live Aid)Queen,"[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...
Of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...

We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...

Here we stand or here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won’t be home tonight

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all, yeah
And it’s time for the hammer to fall

Every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build up...

Tow your line and play their game
'Til the anesthetic covers it all
'Til one day they call your name
Then it's time for the hammer to fall

Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Just wanna  scream it louder and louder and louder

Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
Then it’s time for the hammer to, hammer to fall

76,New HouseRex Orange County,"[Verse 1]
It doesn't come that easy anyway
Every time I try, it never feels the way it did at the start
This one for my dawgs
That see where I’m coming from and know why it's hard
I do it for you
No one can save me this evening
She does her all but I've never been the easiest ride
She says, ""It’s okay, we know it's alright""
(So I sit, picture it)

[Chorus]
I can see us in a house next year
(You'll be) making your mind up
You can figure out what goes where
(And stay) keeping it real with me all the time
All the while, they can't touch me anyway
So I'll be holding it down with you every day

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, yeah)
Holding it down (Oh)
Oh, oh, I'll be holding it down
Holding it down (Yeah)
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm so good at falling asleep
Grateful for you waking me
If it weren't for you, I would’ve stayed here for weeks
And the bed is just upstairs, the only place I feel peace
There’s nothing I forgot to do
Nowhere that I'ma need to be
There’s no one left for me to impress
How am I meant to know what's good
When nothing good on the screen?
It's been the same way for a while now and I'ma come clean
You know that I haven’t been inspired since like I was 18
And the extra stress isn't necessary anyway
So the only thing that's worrying is right in front of me in a line
And life is too short to be staying inside
But I didn't realize I ran from the light
And no one can save me, I'm bleeding
I do my best, but I rarely am a regular guy
At least I've got 3-6-4 more days to get it right
(Take a seat, picture this)

[Chorus]
I can see us in a house next year
You'll be making your mind up
You can figure out what goes where
You'll be keeping it real with me all the time

[Verse 3]
No distraction, no one's even tryna reach me
Well, not until they need something, honestly
And the trouble is
Everybody needs something all the fuckin' time (Time)
Everybody needs something all the fuckin' time
Oh yeah

[Outro]
It doesn't happen like this every day
Every time I look at her, I feel the way I did at the start
She's holding me up, I'll never depart
All the emotions straight from the heart
She got me all in my feelings
I wouldn't know how to live life if it wasn't with her
I know what it's worth"

So I wouldn't come home low

Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones

And I'm coming off this
Long and winding road

Too many romantic dreams
Up in lights
Falling off the silver screen

For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together
At the seams

She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

[Chorus]
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you

[Verse 2]
Are you afraid
However could you not be
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

[Chorus]
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved

[Bridge]
We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love

[Chorus]
And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet"
90,A Reason To FightDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
The image in your eyes
Reflecting the pain that has taken you
I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
From what's ailing you

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you can rise again
So don't give up

[Chorus]
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

[Verse 2]
Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through?

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you will rise again
I won't give up

[Chorus]
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

[Bridge]
Don't let it take your soul
Look at me, take control
We're going to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for

[Interlude]
Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win

[Chorus]
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

I'll be your reason to fight
Give you a reason to fight"

What's wrong?
You've been asking but I don't have an answer
How come?
I'm still thinking, let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old, will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that shit
And stalling only goes so far when you've got a head start

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking, ""Are you bored yet?""
And if you're feeling lonely you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?

[Verse 2: Clairo]
Feels like I've known you my whole life
I can see right through your lies
I don't know where we're going
But I'd like to be by your side
If you could tell me how you're feeling
Maybe we'd get through this undefeated
Holding on for so long

'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset

I don't have the strength to play nice

[Chorus]
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over

At least you're on the radio, oh
At least you're on the radio, huh
At least you're on the radio, oh

The best die young, immortalized

To choose their favorite vice
I don't have the strength to think twice

104,Night RunningCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1: Beck]
We're on a night run
Boy you better hold your tongue
Talking like you're coming from kingdom come
Rhythm and reeling, the feeling I'm riding
The sound through the ceiling
Never got no money
But I'm running from the gun
My engines flooded
Cold blooded no money
Drunk on something, uh
Killing the moonlight with daylight
I got my X-ray eyes
And I'm feeling so fine

[Chorus]
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
We're running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, all night running (We roll)

Night running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, we're all night running (We roll)

[Verse 2: Matt Shultz]
We're on the nightshade
Tell me what we're hiding from
Like someone could steal it
Are we waiting for some kind of feeling
Or saving it up for the morning?
Undercover
The cloak and dagger
Is there a creature in the attic?
Are we for real, yeah?
Or just pretending?
Will it burn out by the morning?

[Chorus]
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
We're running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, all night running (We roll)

Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, we're all night running (We roll)

[Verse 3: Beck and Matt Shultz]
We're on a night run
No telling who we're running from
In a world of secrets and demons and people hiding from the sun
Sending my message to everyone losing control
Better not stop 'til I get home
Sentimental flowers don't grow
Got to live through tidal waves
And parishes and biblical floods
I got the gris-gris love
And the streets in my blood
I'm on the final run
Falling in and out of love, oh

[Chorus]
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
We're running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, all night running (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, we're all night running (We roll)"

106,Remember WhenBad Wolves,"[Verse 1]
Remember when, when it was 1992
Two little kids stealing records, skipping school
We must have been like only ten
Taking life for granted till we learn it had an end
Remember when, and time is something they say
You never appreciate till you age
And to this day you never knew
I wanted to be just like you

[Chorus]
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now

[Verse 2]
Remember when, when it was 2002
You started slinging coke and got the dopest pair of shoes
But, yo, this house just ain't a home
Since our father hit the bottle and our mother hit the road
And time is something they say
You never understand until it slips away
And looking back I think you knew
I wanted to be just like you

If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now

If I only knew, then what I know now

Do we make sense?
I think we do
In spite of everything that we've been through

And I say white
It's not about who's wrong
As long as it feels right
Don't think those stars won't align

[Chorus]
Under your scars I pray

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 1]
I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 2]
Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

[Bridge]
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?"

They gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

120,This LifeVampire Weekend,"[Verse 1]
Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain
I just thought it didn't rain in California
Baby, I know love isn't what I thought it was
'Cause I've never known a love like this before ya
Baby, I know dreams tend to crumble at extremes
I just thought our dream would last a little bit longer
There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand
We're surviving, we're still living, are we stronger?

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate
I just thought we locked the gate when we left in the morning
And I was told that war is how we landed on these shores
I just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing? (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)

[Verse 3]
Baby, I know death probably hasn't happened yet
'Cause I don't remember living life before this
And darling, our disease is the same one as the trees
Unaware that they've been living in a forest

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing? (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
This life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing?"
121,Blame It On My YouthBlink-182,"[Intro: Matt Skiba]
Blame it, blame it on my youth

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
(Blame, blame, blame on my youth)

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
I wasn't made for the good life
I ended up getting stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
Tough breaks are the only kind I know
I was left on a door step
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbors' fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You could never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

[Bridge: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
I was raised on the Ritalin
Ever since I was a little kid (Little kid)
No one ever seemed to give a shit (Give a shit)
And I don't need an excuse
I don't need an excuse

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never kill my high (Endless summer)
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Stretching on and on)
Blame it, blame it on my youth (Oh, oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth (Oh, oh)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
Endless summer
Stretching on and on"

Thought I'd never be waking on the kitchen floor
But here I lie, not the first time
Now my morning has broken, and it brings the fear
My mind's falling, fall in

Then I feel my pulse quickening
But regrets can't change anything
Yeah, I feel my pulse quickening

From self-pity, poor me

But I wouldn't change a thing

And if the city's skyscrapers rise over this island
Would you be glad to see Manhattan for once?
I knew the dream, it died, JMZ line, Myrtle, and Broadway
But I'd be glad to see Manhattan for once

Woah-woah, living life in the city
Woah-woah, it will never be pretty, oh, oh

And if you leave, don't leave me all alone

And I miss my dad and Cleopatra sitting on a phone
So take me back off these streets and we'll never be apart
Together from the start
Never, never falling back alone

Living life in the city
Oh-oh, it will never be pretty, oh, oh
Oh-oh, we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah

And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you just lay down and dig your grave?
Or will you rail against your dying day?

[Joakim Brodén]
""So, did you find the boat?""

[Verse 1]
From the mist, a shape, a ship, is taking form
And the silence of the sea is about to drift into a storm
Sign of power, show of force
Raise the anchor, battleship's plotting its course

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion, king of the ocean

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

[Verse 2]
Two thousand men, and fifty thousand tons of steel
Set the course for the Atlantic with the Allies on their heel
Firepower, firefight
Battle Stations, keep the targets steady in sight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Into formation, the hunt has begun
Death and damnation, the fleet is coming

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

At the bottom of the ocean, the depths of the abyss
They are bound by iron and blood
The flagship of the navy, the terror of the seas
His guns have gone silent at last

Rylan, you should try to get some sun
You remind me of everyone
Rylan, did you break your mother's heart?
Every time you tried to play your part

[Chorus]
Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Underwater, you're almost free
If you wanna be alone, come with me

[Verse 2]
Rylan, we can take the quick way out
We can turn blank white in a blank white house
Say that you're a pervert, you're a vulture
Don't you wanna be popular culture?

[Chorus]
Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Underwater, you're almost free
If you wanna be alone, come with me
Is it easy to live inside yourself?
All the little kids are high and hazy
Everybody's got nowhere to go
Everybody wants to be amazing

[Bridge]
Rylan, California's rotten
Dress light blue to be forgotten
Eat your pearls on Sunday morning
Keep your conversations boring
Stay with me among the strangers
Change your mind and nothing changes
Don't let show any emotion
When you climb into the ocean

Rylan, you should try to get some sun
There's a little bit of hell in everyone

You remind me of everyone

Rylan, you should try to get some sun"

I saved a picture where your hair was braided
They found your wallet in the cemetery
You told your daughter she was ordinary

You hate the name Junior
Your husband loved his computers
Your mother never was one
The eldest of seven children

If you don’t have it, then you'll never give it
And I don't blame you for the way you livin’
The little boy was born in February
You couldn't sober up to hold a baby

You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry

Hold my hand now, time to
Go to bed, it's way too late

You had your soul with you, I was in no mood
Drift away, and I could forget
I had only one last feather left
I wore it on the island of my head
I had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger]
You felt like heaven stood up in you
You said love fills you out
It moves you from the skeleton and pulls you around
I got it worse than anyone else
And I just can't find a way to forgive myself
I had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet

[Verse 3: Gail Ann Dorsey & Matt Berninger]
I have owed it to my heart, every word I've said
You have no idea how hard I died when you left
If I yield to my trances, will I get up close again?
I had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet
I had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet

Bring your waves and the thunder
Make me believe forevermore
Outside my window, I can see

Horns that sprout out from your head
A glowing light near the surface

Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think something's fucking wrong with me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong, but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?

Roll me up and smoke me, love

Roll me up and smoke me, love

135,Typical StoryHobo Johnson,"[Verse 1]
It’s a– It’s a– It’s a–
It’s a typical story
Where the bassist kills the singer
And the guitarist and the drummer
Find they’re in love with each other
It's the story of the kid
Who clearly won’t know what to say
When the love of his life starts to calmly walk away
And it’s the story of the dad
Who decides to chase his dream
He quits his job, he falls apart
And he loses everything
And it’s the story of the kid who just wants to make a record
Loves and crafts it but nobody ever, ever cares about it

[Chorus]
Well, hey, hey, what’s your name?
Talk is for the guys you hate
We should sit in silence
While we think of what to say, hey
Hey, hey, I don’t think this is working out
Will you forget I even asked you to come over to my house?
Hey, hey I don’t think I know much
But I know I couldn’t take a good punch
So if you feel like I’ve been talking enough
Just tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck up

[Verse 2]
And I’m afraid of everything
Staying the same or worsening
So what’s the point of finding calm
When calm to me is unsettling?
Settle down, little kid
Your bones are shaking in your skin
Go and try and take a breath
Though nothing more, nothing less
(It’s a– It’s a– It’s a–)
It’s a typical story of a king who had it all
Except for citizens who didn’t want his head up on a wall
It’s a typical story of the wife who couldn’t quit
Being in love with such a giant piece of shit
It’s the story of the queen who could never ever think
Of any redeeming qualities a man could ever bring
It’s the story of the dog who wanted to run away
'Til he learned that his life is way safer inside a cage

[Bridge]
I don’t really need much
Just a place to be alone and you won’t really see much
I think that I’m invisible
My mirror shows another guy
A guy who doesn’t do shit
He just sits and is miserable
Everybody’s gotta live a life
That they didn’t ask for, why
Why would he put me here
Just to die, just to, just to
Die?!

[Chorus]
Well, hey, hey, what’s your name?
Talk is for the guys you hate
We should sit in silence
While we think of what to say, hey
Hey, hey, I don’t think this is working out
Will you forget I even asked you to come over to my house?
Hey, hey I don’t think I know much
But I know I couldn’t take a good punch
So if you feel like I’ve been talking enough
Just tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck up

[Bridge]
Everybody’s gotta live a life
That they didn’t ask for
Why would he put me here
Just to die, just to, just to
Die?!

Well, hey, hey, what’s your name?
Talk is for the guys you hate
We should sit in silence
While we think of what to say, hey
Hey, hey, I don’t think this is working out
Will you forget I even asked you to come over to my house?
And hey, hey I don’t think I know much
But I know I couldn’t take a good punch
So if you feel like I’ve been talking enough
Just tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck up and die"

Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

[Verse 1]
Oh, I felt weak tonight
'Cause I caught myself not being caught up with the times
Strangely, you and I cross the finish line
But big hearts move slow, get left behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying next to someone else, oh
But sometimes, I still remember what you said and how it felt

[Chorus]
Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
It's all locked up inside
This giant hole, this stupid quicksand life of mine
And I guess I can't let go, even though I've tried
But it'll stay here with me 'til the day I die

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying next to someone else, oh
But I'll always remember what you said and how it felt

[Chorus]
Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)
I can't stop it, woah, oh (Woah)
(Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic)
Oh, oh, oh (Woah, ooh)
('Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby I can't stop it)
Oh (Woah, woah)

('Cause the memories are flooding my mind)
Woah, I can't stop

I'm in the lion’s cave
I've done it all before
I feel alive again
But maybe not for long
Another day will come

140,Time Waits For No OneFreddie Mercury,"[Chorus]
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody

[Verse 1]
We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me
We've not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all now

[Chorus]
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
We've got to build this world together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time, it waits for nobody
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong
You know what's going on
And it seems to me we've not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all
It seems like we've all got our backs against the wall

[Bridge]
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
We've got to trust in one another
Or we'll have no more future at all

[Chorus]
Because time
Waits for nobody
Waits for nobody
Time waits for no one
Best not to be friends with one another
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody

142,Why Did You Run?Judah,"[Verse 1]
Got the call on the streets of Seattle
She said, ""Honey, I don't got much time to talk""
I broke down 'cause I knew what was next
And she said, ""I'm okay, but I'm locked in a holding cell
'Til someone gets me out
Can you help me? I have no one else""
So there I was, a defenseless middle kid
Crying out for the right words to say
Sorry, I can't do anything at all
So I hung up and called you
I hung up and called you

'Cause you were the one, oh
You were the one I needed
You were the one, oh
You were the one I needed the most

[Chorus]
Why, why did you run?
Why, why did you run?
Why, why did you run? Oh

[Verse 2]
So I took a stupid fight with him after the accident
Funny now 'cause I thought it was your defense
'Cause I thought you were sober then
So there I was, a lost kid looking for a home that he once knew
So I broke down and called you
I broke down and called you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were the one, oh
You were the one I needed
You were the one, oh
You were the one I needed the most

Shut up, count your calories
I never look good in mom jeans
Wish I was like you
Blue-eyed blondie, perfect body

[Chorus 1]
Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your expectations
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
I was never cut out for Prom Queen

[Post-Chorus]
If I get more pretty, do you think he will like me?

[Verse 2]
Dissect my insecurities
I'm a defect surgical project

Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your beauty standards
I'm no Quick-Curl Barbie
I was never cut out for Prom Queen

I've been starving myself, carving
Skin until my bones are showing

They say beauty is pain
You'll only be happy
If you look a certain way

144,ParentsYUNGBLUD,"[Intro]
Blah!

[Verse 1]
I was born in a messed up century
My favourite flavoured sweets are raspberry amphetamines
I bought a carburettor, age 16
I brush my teeth with bleach 'cause I ain't got time for cavities
My daddy put a gun to my head
Said, ""If you kiss a boy, I'm gonna shoot you dead""
So I tied him up with gaffer tape and I locked him in a shed
Then I went out to the garden and I fucked my best friend

[Chorus]
'Cause my high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive
'Cause parents ain't always right

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I-I-I

[Verse 2]
Threw a toaster in my bath, watch my mum and dad laugh
See a thousand volts go through the son they wish they never had
They told me casual affection leads to sexual infection
But it's hard to get an erection when you're so used to rejection
Yeah, the teacher fucked the preacher
But then he had to leave her
Had to wash away the sins of a male cheerleader
""Hi, nice to meet ya,"" got nothing to believe in
So let me know when my breathing stops

[Chorus]
'Cause my high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive
'Cause parents ain't always right

I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I

Tick, tock, stop the clock
Because I get the feeling that I'm gonna get shot
Tick, tock, stop the clock
Because I get the feeling that I'm gonna get shot

[Chorus]
My high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive
'Cause parents ain't always right

145,Bored And RazedThe Raconteurs,"[Verse 1]
Rolling a juke joint box in the corner
Trolling myself in the mirror at night
Keeping an eye on my grindstone future
Staying away from the left and the right

[Chorus 1]
California bored and razed
These days, she's living with another
Plastic features, perfect face
What a waste and I'm still thinking of her

[Verse 2]
Laying the cardinal sins on the table
Pouring the coffee out on the grounds
Changing the losses to wins if I'm able
Switching the pitch to an audible sound
Running the rounds of the mundane soldier
Trading the cards and erasing the names
Feeling a pounding, insane, colder
Sounding, system, feeding the flames

[Chorus 2]
Well, I'm Detroit born and raised
But these days, I'm living with another
You tell me she can be replaced
But that's not the case, I'm so lost without her

Rolling a juke joint box in the corner
Trolling myself in the mirror at night
Keeping an eye on my grindstone future
Staying away from the left and the right"
147,Solway FirthSlipknot,"[Intro]
Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here’s an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

[Verse 1]
While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

[Chorus]
I don’t need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just wanna feel like any other man
I won't show you the whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

[Post-Chorus]
Here’s an unexplainable one
Here’s an unexplainable one

[Verse 2]
I'm not ahead of my time, I just drew the first breath
If I’m alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

[Chorus]
I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don’t need you to hide it from me
I just wanna feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

[Post-Chorus]
What have you done?
What have you done?
Yeah

[Outro]
Oh, while I was learning to live, you taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted
Another needle in the back through purified scarification
It wasn't somebody else, you fucking did it to me
You want a real smile?
I haven't smiled in years"
148,The Hypetwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I’ll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you’re a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

Life is degrading and silently making me
Spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death

I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

[Chorus]
So come give me the truth you hide

Humiliating, I fall to its craving
It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading, our feelings I'm saving

Alone in my car, I'm in a parking lot, darkest spot in my mind

Cursing myself, I burned the furniture a million times in my head
I'm feeling low, got nowhere to go, but back up again

Once again we hear them calling for war
It doesn't matter what they're fighting for
They light the match and watch the whole world burst into flame

Behold the propaganda, get your fill
A distant enemy is threatening our freedom again

We will no longer be their whore

They don't care about the blood on their hands
Look at the world, and you will understand
They count the money as the innocent continue to bleed
They're always planting the seed
So tell me, people, are you ready to die
Without believing in the reason why?
They paint a picture, and the whole damn world is deceived
It's all that they ever need

Millions keep falling in line
It's only a matter of time
Sowing destruction will make sure their pockets are lined
For all time

We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war

How they smile as we pay for their war

Zero chances, no way out
No solutions, give in now
There's no point resisting, there's nobody listening
Are we just sick? (Sick)
Are we just tired? (Tired)
Apathetic, uninspired

So tell me what's real
I don't know if I can feel

You're leaving us all behind with hell to pay

All of the dearly beloved
Your time is up, they're out for blood
Misery made us so hopelessly faithless (Hey)
And now I can't believe (Hey) a single word that you say (Say)
Secrets kept, a thin disguise, empty threats are full of lies (Hey)
Do what you will, you just add to your bill now

I don't see the light

All that we have is just slipping away

155,"Lover, LeaverGreta Van Fleet","[Verse 1]
Oh, my holy Lord
Sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
She's my heart's desire
She's an angel straight from Hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness way below
It's my heart she'll keep
Yeah

Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind it takes the sky
And winter takes us all
Mountain high against the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing loud and smiling proud
This is where we lay

Taker

Oh God hellfire
Witch of Endor raised
Saul would fall to his knees, watch the fire blaze
Satan plays his flute for him
The sound it burns his ears
Watches as the peace of man slips and disappears

Wait, when am I gonna lose you?
How will I let you slip through?
Careless or unkind?
Trace the curving of the coastline
The Santa Lucia cliffside
We'll stay here for the night

Everything has its place
Now I lie in our bed
Wondering how to explain

Engrave the silhouette of you dancing
A shadow play that we're cast in
On the cabin walls

You were floating to me
In a slow-motion fade
Could I finally see
Between belief and faith?

When am I gonna lose

I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees tumbling down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you
I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees tumbling down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you

160,OutnumberedDermot Kennedy,"[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 1]
I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See, I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart (Yeah)
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go, just know it kills me to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 2]
But there's beauty here that's yet to depart
There's still a song inside the halls in the dark (Halls in the dark)
I'll come for you if you just stay where you are
And I'll always hold your hand in the car (Hand in the car)
There'll be days when it's difficult
But I ask you to never leave behind the reciprocal, we're past that
Love is not designed for the cynical
So we have that (We have that)
We can have that

To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Bridge]
How long can you wait for the one you deserve?
Fight on, never let it out, never let it out
If I'm gone, if you ever leave I hope that you learn
To fight on, to fight on

Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing

To determine what we have to lose? (To lose)

Becomes so lost in this world of hypocrisy

Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer!

[Verse 2]
I've got to figure something out
But I don't know where to start
I found my keys under the couch
But I'm scared of going out
Having all these doubts and I'd rather
Stay home cuz there's no place to run!

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer

I'll be wasting time
In the sunshine
I'll be flying high
In the summer time

Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer!"

Every second counts
I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and
All these little games
You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah
Every minute counts
I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
Can you figure me out?
Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch

[Chorus]
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

[Verse 2]
Pour your glass of wine
Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah)
Cases under the bed
Spill it open, let it rush to my head
I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
Savor this with everything I have inside of me
I'm not the type to run
I know that we're having fun
But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed

[Bridge]
Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me

[Chorus]
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse

Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

Take my foot off the gas
Step on paper-thin glass
Play the music and dance
It's my addiction

Calm down my obsessed mind

Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him be provoked
Father, by self-control

[Verse 1]
I'm just a Judas, lookin' for a silver line
And tomorrow is still a step behind
Hey, hey, drama, I'd love to be a waste of your time
Oh no, thanks so much for wasting mine
So hear me out
Let's hear it for the damaged
Who understands but the broken?
Developed in the arms of spite
I'm all fucked up and I make it look good
Adrenaline sight tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

[Chorus]
Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the cruel

[Verse 2]
Remember how you spent the best part of forever
In a state of pure disease?
It was another thing altogether
To forget that you brought out the worst in me
Hey, karma, you don't feel like I do
You just wish you'd hate like I do
We are the bitter, the maladjusted and wise
Fighting off a generation too uptight
We're all dressed up with nobody to kill
The rhetoric stops tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me

Shifting the focus to scare

174,Welcome HomeHellYeah,"[Verse 1]
Far off in the distance, the storm's closing in
The pressure collapsing, bright skies become dim
This scent all around me, give memories new life
Knots that I've loosened still tangled inside
Ominous clouds, no sun in the sky
Is this a metaphor for my tragic demise?
The colors are gray on my canvas of life
The picture's complete, but the paint just won't dry

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home

[Verse 2]
And those dirty little whispers, demon's voice in my head
Angel over my shoulder, evil needs to be fed
Hot flashes turn cold as day turns to night
My head starts to ache because something's not right
Pour salt in my wounds, I'm cut deep inside
Battered and bruised, bones breaking, teeth bite
Tattered and torn, pour gas on my life
You can burn up the book, but the pages survive

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home, so welcome home

[Post-Chorus]
So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome

The sky is falling, the sky is falling down
The ocean's flooding, the oceans are swelling everywhere all around
The fire's burning, fire burns me to the ground
What the fuck was I waiting for?
All you fucking little pigs, I'll blow you down

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home, so welcome home

So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome home"
175,Sing AlongSturgill Simpson,"[Verse 1]
Words can stab as deep as night
And cut like a razored thorn
Bitter air and the winds of spite
Like the cold of winter's scorn
Leaves may fall on sleeping ground
But the wind sweeps them away
Like hurt lovers in the final round
What once was is now decayed

[Chorus]
I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone

[Verse 2]
A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancin' in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one
Compromise is made out of peace
But history's made out of violence
After the war of the words has ceased
All that's left is the deafenin' silence

[Chorus]
I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong, so here's your song
Now sing along, baby

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Well, I know you know that you're killin' me
But it's worth it just to see you smile
Tell 'em to carve my name in the barstool, baby
You know I'm gonna be here a while
A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancin' in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one

[Chorus]
I can't go on livin' alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong, so here's your song
Now sing along"

First pill that you drop only sets it off

Am I your go-to or am I uncool?
With all of these extremes that I go to
All I want is to be wanted by you
All I want is to be wanted by you

I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Ooh, hit me

I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummer
There must be more behind the summer
I want someone to make some trouble
Been way too safe inside my bubble, oh
Take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light

Carry me away
Carry me away

Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away

You carnivore, you loose cannon
Can I have some more? I can't understand it
You fast car, you foolish spender
You know you are, and I surrender
So come on over and wake me up
Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
You know I need you, and that's for sure
You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for

[Chorus]
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Where the sun hits my face all different
Carry me away
Carry me away"

187,10/10Rex Orange County,"[Verse 1]
I had to think about my oldest friends
Now, I no longer hang with them
And I can't wait to be home again
I had a year that nearly sent me off the edge
I feel like a five, I can't pretend
But if I get my shit together this year
Maybe I'll be a ten

[Pre-Chorus]
Help myself a little better
'Cause it's getting tirin'
And I can't wait for the summer
Now, I'm gonna need a moment

[Chorus]
I did it again, I did it again
No control over my emotions
One year on and I still can't focus
I did it again, yeah
I did it, I did it again
Twelve rounds in, fightin' solo
But nobody wins when it ends

[Verse 2]
We'll be placin' memories in frames
Invitin' people 'round to stay
And always owning up to things, to things
'Cause after all, I guess it all depends upon
The people you choose and where you're from
If so, I've been so lucky, so far, it's outrageous
I won't complain (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give myself a little credit
Since I dealt with all the pain
Yeah, I turned superhero
I'm comin' in Bruce Wayne

[Chorus]
Yeah, I did it again, I did it again
But this time I took control
And turned my shit 'round
Sometimes you gotta cut a bitch out
I'm livin' again, yeah
I'm livin', I'm livin' again

The people you choose and where you're from"

I don't believe that we were ever meant to be
Left underneath the light of dying stars (Dying stars)
Push me off of the edge of the world (Fall apart)
Watch me as I slowly fall apart
Set fire to the roof of your house
And waited for the sirens to wail (Sirens wail)
Left your favorite records to melt (Left to melt)
Listen as you damned me to hell

Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
Well, what did I think would happen?
I wouldn't dream of asking
You waited here for me so long
I lived in fear that you moved on
What have I done to us? It seems
I've broken trust and shattered dreams
I only wish I'd spoken of
The loneliness since we broke up

Angel wings at the bus stop

[Bridge: Matt Skiba]
Say a prayer that you'll make it to the other side
It won't make no sense and you lose your mind
We're lost in our ways (We're lost in our ways)
Nothing left to say, no (Nothing left to say)
Make a wish that you'll get a chance to say goodbye
Before the shots ring out in the dead of night
We're stuck in our ways (We're stuck in our ways)
I've got so much to say, oh (I've got so much to say)
Showed up like shadows in this crowd
Brought the fire blinding
Came here to quickly tear us down, down, down

Tragedy (Tragedy)
Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain
Oh, tragedy (Tragedy)
You took my everything (You took my everything)
Oh, now all I feel
All I feel is pain
Oh, how can I go on
Knowing that I lost you?
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I went and searched for some answers
But all I found were monsters
They're under my bed
They're haunting this tie that's been severed
This tie that's been severed
Now I follow your footsteps
Through the ashes you once crept
I feel so hollow now
I'm trapped on this island
This island of regret

Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see

Knowing that I lost you?
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
They left a note on the front door
With a time and a place as the tears poured from my eyes
Straight to the floor, there was no going back once we knew what they came for
And all I have here is heartache
And bones, and mirrors for me to break
Only so much bad luck a person can take
We quiver and quake, we shiver and shake

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
Tragedy (Tragedy)
Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain
Oh, tragedy"

[Verse 1: Matt Skiba]
Photographs of you are still haunting my halls
Still framed and blue, say nothing at all
Sacrifice myself, leave me dead in the sun
Put it on a shelf, leave it there for everyone to see
Is that all you have, is that all you have to say?

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
Lying on the bedroom floor
Hanging on the words that you said before
No heart, no heart to speak of
Dying on the bathroom floor
Thinking of the life that we had before
No heart, no heart to speak of

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Nothing left but scars, clawed away at my heart
On a crumbling edge, watch me falling apart
Feel the birds of prey circle over our home
Vultures in the ash, separating skin from bone
Is that all you have, is that all you have to say?

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
Lying on the bedroom floor
Hanging on the words that you said before
No heart, no heart to speak of
Dying on the bathroom floor
Thinking of the life that we had before
No heart, no heart to speak of

And I think one day
And I think one day
We'll both just fade away
And I think one day
We'll pay for our mistakes
And I think one day
I'm gonna slip away

Lying on the bedroom floor
Hanging on the words that you said before
No heart, no heart to speak of
Dying on the bathroom floor
Thinking of the life that we had before

Met you in the dark, where we stumble in the mysteries
An opened book that you took and now I'm history

There's a poster on my wall
With a picture that says you're missing
My friends say I should rip it apart
Thought I saw you at the bodega
Thought I heard your voice at the bar
Time is slipping out through my fingers
I'm wishing on a burned out star

They say forgive and forget
As long as I live, I'll let
These feelings pound in my chest
Maybe I am better off dead

Thinking back to times in Manhattan
And that SoHo gallery
Saw the sights and your favorite paintings

How'd things get so dark and shitty?
Sunrise always gives us the creeps

Fall back in our routines
Like nights I still dream about

Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You
It's you and me

[Chorus]
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

[Verse 2]
You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy

[Chorus]
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy

Come on, baby
Come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience

[Chorus 2]
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
Say, if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

[Outro]
Say, if I only could
With no problems
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill

201,Die HappyDREAMERS,"[Intro]
Yeah, I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time

[Verse 1]
I met a girl, she had expensive perfume
Was a waste of money, didn't smell so lovely like you
And now you're on my steps up late night
Chain smoking Pall Malls while I philosophize

[Pre-Chorus]
Glass sky, killin' time
You leaned upon my shoulder
And my thoughts dried, didn't mind

[Chorus]
So alive, I felt like I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time
Yeah, I could die now that I've been floating
High upon the smoke in your eyes

[Verse 2]
And I've been burned, yeah, and I've burned myself
Saw no point in falling just to burn somebody else
But now your dreams are catching my eye
Maybe we could stay up and pretend for a while

[Pre-Chorus]
Glass sky, killing time
You leaned upon my shoulder
And my thoughts dried, didn't mind

[Chorus]
So alive, I felt like I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time
Yeah, I could die now that I've been floating
High upon the smoke in your eyes

And in the darkness, we leave our bodies
Leave our bodies, so alive

High upon the smoke in your eyes

Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in his voice so sweet
I thought that I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will""

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter

What's done in the dark will be brought to the light
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time

I hope the encore lasts forever
Now there's time for us to spend

When you say my name, nothing's changed
I'm still a boy inside my thoughts
Am I meant to understand my faults?

I don't think so
I don't think I'm meant to understand myself
Maybe you do

Maybe in time
Maybe one day

Being alone outside, they
Cannot suffocate me when they
Cannot fucking chase me out (Ayy)

I may have tricked myself, she couldn't shake it
So I guess you might be right

Every morning, I ride on a carousel
To the sides of my mind that I cannot help
Had to die in Heaven just to get to Hell
Fell when the lights went out now
My real friends act like they don't know me
This headache's giving me a nosebleed
My silence is killing me slowly
I can't keep tuning it out and

Anytime you see me smilin', it was probably for show
All the memories are blurry, so I let 'em burn slow

You was outta pocket when you told me ""Die slow""
I was going through the shits, I kept it down low
Tongue-tied, tongue-tied, what we had was all lies

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway
Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase
I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
I battle with depression, but the question still remains
Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage?
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer

Falling into love now with falling apart
I'm a popular, popular monster

[Verse 2]
I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace
I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace
How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste
Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention
I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing
And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave
I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again
Crashed my car just to feel again
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster

Falling into love now with falling apart
I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah

[Breakdown]
Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh
We're sick and tired of wondering
Praying to a god that you don't believe
You're searching for the truth in the lost and found
So the question I ask is, oh, where the fuck is your god now?

I'm searchin' for a way out

And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say
It hit me like a hurricane (Hurricane)
It hit me like a tidal wave (Tidal wave)
And I don't know why I drown my mind it got the best of me

[Bridge]
With your life on the line
Ready to die for something
When you're at the divide
And you're down to nothing
Look into my eyes
Believe me that the storm is coming
Believe me that the storm is coming
Down, down, down
It's coming down

[Chorus]
It hit me like a hurricane
It hit me like a tidal wave
And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say
It hit me like a hurricane (Hurricane)
It hit me like a tidal wave (Tidal wave)
And I don't know why I drown my mind, it got the best of me

Believe me that the storm is coming down

Lately, I don't give a fuck
'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with anyone
And maybe, I'm already gone"

233,Can I Call You Tonight?Dayglow,"[Verse 1]
I feel close
Well maybe I’m not, heaven knows
It’s a spotlight stuck on the ceiling
Why are these the things that I’m feeling?
There’s so much time
For me to speak up, but I keep quiet
I’ll complicate the most of the mantra
The power's out and I can’t turn the fan on

[Chorus]
So can I call you tonight?
I’m trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I’m no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real anymore?
Cause I wouldn’t know

[Verse 2]
Voice so low
Sneaking around, so it goes
I always try my best to listen
Picking up things that I can fidget
Circle speed
Pacing around, watching my feet
Batteries drain, I get the memo
“I think that I might have to let you go”

[Chorus]
So can I call you tonight?
I’m trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I’m no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real anymore?
Cause I wouldn’t know

Don’t go, don’t go and leave me
Don’t go, don’t go so easy
Don’t go, don’t go and leave me
Don’t go, don’t go so easy
Don’t go, don’t go and leave me
Don’t go, don’t go so easy
Don’t go, don’t go and leave me
Don't go, go

[Chorus]
So can I call you tonight?
I’m trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I’m no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what’s real anymore?

234,LudensBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
Some resist the future, some refuse the past
Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact
That a world covered in cables was never wired to last
So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash

[Pre-Chorus]
(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like a phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity

[Chorus]
Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

[Verse 2]
Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show

[Pre-Chorus]
(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves

We could fight a war for peace

Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down

But, oh until it falls won't bother me

Taking my sulkin' to the masses

Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

There can be loneliness?

Wake up to a cloudy day
Dark rolls in, and it starts to rain
Staring out to the cage-like walls
Time goes by and the shadows crawl
Crushing candy, crushing pills
Got no job, mom pays my bills
Texting exes, get my fill
Sweating bullets, Netflix chills
World's out there singing the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself: ""Really, what's the use?""
I'm just like you, I was born to lose

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
When all I want's to get high
And forget this so-called life

I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)

Can't wait to feel better than I ever will
Attack that shit like a kid on Benadryl
Chase it down with a hopeful smile
Hate myself, I can go for miles
They say family's all you need
Someone to trust who can help you breathe
Inhale that drug, but you start to choke
You fall on the outs of an inside joke

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
Cause I've seen enough of it, heard enough of it, felt enough of it
Had enough of it!

[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)

Superman is a hero
But only when his mind is clear, though

Too bad that shit don't work though

246,Whatever It TakesImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"
247,No RootsAlice Merton,"[Verse 1]
I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Verse 2]
I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

[Chorus]
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots

[Verse 3]
I like standing still but that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Verse 4]
I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

[Chorus]
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots

I like digging holes, hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I won't forget to find them

249,Up All NightBeck,"[Verse 1]
When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up, you're working it 'round
Now get yourself together
When you call the dominoes fall, it's time to go

250,One More LightLinkin Park,"[Verse 1]
Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Verse 2 ]
The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars

Who cares when someone's time runs out?

251,Sit Next To MeFoster The People,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, it’s over, it’s over, I’m circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said “What’s up?” and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you but we’re always on the move
And now it’s over, we’re sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain’t getting younger, last call’s around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted and I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers ‘cause now all I want is you
Just sayin’

Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high

[Verse 2]
Well, I ain’t frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light
But I’m here to tell you I’m not trying to change your mind
It’s alright, ooh, it’s alright, oooh

British to the very last

No, there's nothing you can do about it"
253,Ben Franklin's SongThe Decemberists,"[Verse 1]
Electricity! Yeah, you can all thank me
Took some lightning, a kite, and a fat brass key
And they're putting up streetlights in Gay Paris
You’re welcome from our young nation
I’m the only American the French wanna see
They call me a genius, I can’t disagree
They have guns, they have funds
They can set us free, invest in my reputation

[Chorus]
And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin

[Verse 2]
I said, early to bed, bitches, early to rise
They make a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
Soldiers are fighting for freedom, they have no supplies
So diplomacy happens at night
John Adams debates at the gates of Versailles
He whines and berates and awaits a reply
As I stay up late with a succulent breast or a thigh
Alright, diplomacy happens at night

[Chorus]
And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am 76-and-I’ll-Still-Kick-Your-Ass Fuckin’ Franklin

[Bridge]
One pain that lingers, the hitch in my stride
Is my son back at home who I could not guide
Who sits all alone in a prison cell on the wrong side
Stands against our young nation
So I play my ambassador part with pride
I am known in the world and the world is wide
To my children, my sins may be magnified
But I’d do it all again, no hesitation

[Chorus]
And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin
(Do you know who the fuck I am?) Who the fuck I am?
(Do you know who the fuck I am?) Who the fuck I am?
(Do you know who the fuck I am?)
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Polymath, bifocal-wearing
Harp and glass-armonica-playing

When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy

Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me

262,Into The FireAsking Alexandria,"[Intro]
Take him out back
Take him out back
Take him out back

[Verse 1]
I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do with this
These hands, this mind, this instability
From a cage I created to a Hell that Heaven made
Can't let go of the hatred 'cause I love the way it tastes

[Pre-Chorus]
Take him out back

[Chorus]
I wouldn't take back a moment
Not one miserable moment
I'll give it all till there's nothing
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire

[Verse 2]
I've come to terms with the fact I'll never change
And that's just fine, I find solace in the pain
I don't mind the darkness, it's easy on the eyes
I'm praying for something to make me feel alive

[Chorus]
I wouldn't take back a moment
Not one miserable moment
I'll give it all till there's nothing
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire

[Bridge]
I'm a paranoid sycophant, masochistic dilettante
Narcissistic elephant in the room
I'm the end of the world thinning the herd
The all-around outta my mind, fucking absurd
I am gone, I am gone

[Chorus]
I wouldn't take back a moment
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
I'll walk into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire
Fire

Take him out back"
263,Happy HourWeezer,"[Verse 1]
I'm like Stevie Ray Vaughan on the stage, high on music
Teeth grindin', sweatin' under the lights
But then my boss comes
And she's crushin' me with a 20-ton weight
Just like in Monty Python
Somebody left on the sink, it's still running
My eyes are gonna overflow

[Chorus]
I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)

[Verse 2]
I'm like Ponce de Leon
Setting on a ship for the new world
Checking out the birds and flowers
Let's chill out on this island, I've been
Sucking on a lime and coconut (coconut)
Coconut (coconut)
I think I could stay here for the rest of my life
Please, don't ever make me go home

[Chorus]
I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
It's my happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
We'll conversate about rare birds and MIDI keyboards
And we'll slow dance, head on my shoulder
Swayin' back and forth and
My friends look on and smile
Everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
It's my happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)
I need happy hour, to save me
Maybe I'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
We'll conversate about rare birds and MIDI keyboards
And we'll slow dance
I need a happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)"

Faith is like a fire that never burns to embers

I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside
I, I, can't, can't sit here quiet

You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

[Chorus: John Cooper]
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

[Verse 2: John Cooper]
(Hey) Can you hear me? (Hey) Are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history

They can take my heart, they can take my breath
When they pry it from my cold, dead chest

Let's go to war
Let's go to war
We arm ourselves with the wrongs we've done
Name them off one by one

You push it in
And you cut me down
And you cut me down

Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?

Hush my baby; make no sound
Maybe we can wait each other out

But you turn it around

Screaming at the ones we love

Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Screaming at the ones we love

Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?

[Bridge]
Do we censor or do we flow?
Are we drunk on the chemicals?
Every feeling in my bones tells me to lash out
And tell you to fuck off
You've got my heart
And I've got your soul
But are we better off alone?
With every battle, we lose a little more
Remember everything that we'd die for
You are everything that I'd die for

[Chorus]
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do you feel safe?"

Three thirty in the morning
Not a soul in sight
The city's looking like a ghost town
On a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield
There's a storm moving in
He's heading back from somewhere
That he never should have been

[Pre-Chorus]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Verse 2]
Every light is burning
In a house across town
She's pacing by the telephone
In her faded flannel gown
Asking for a miracle
Hoping she's not right
Praying it's the weather
That's kept him out all night

[Pre-Chorus]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls
And the lightning strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls

[Verse 3]
She's waiting by the window
When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain
A strange new perfume blows
And the lightning flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows

[Pre-Chorus]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls!

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls
And the lightning strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on

The thunder rolls on

What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

[Chorus]
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I saw my mother on the street last night
All pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long'
I said 'Momma I know you've tried'
But she fell on her knees and cried

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back

Take a look around me
Taking pages from a magazine
Been looking for the answers
Ever since we were seventeen
You know the truth can be a weapon
To fight this world of ill intentions
A new answer to the same question
How many times will you learn the same lesson?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think they got it all wrong
We just gotta hold on
And on, and on, and on

This is what we came for
And we couldn't want it anymore

Through the struggles and the trade-offs
Fighting tooth and nail on the way up
Tell them the truth, but they think it's just made up

For you might never make it out alive
You gotta live without a compromise
Let everybody hear your battle cry

Well, it was last week
And you ran out of the house
I heard his sparkomatic
And when you came back
I felt you losing touch
I knew you couldn't be trusted

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've known better when you're coming to bed at four in the morning
I should've taken your eyes avoiding mine as a warning
Every time I ask you, ""What's up baby?"" you're changing your story
Just so you know that when you go I ain’t begging for you back

I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back
I don’t want you back

Another year passed
Another Friday night
You showed up at the disco
And when we caught eyes
The room started to spin
And my heart nearly busted

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've known better but the liquor got me thinking I miss ya
I should've taken two steps back but I wanted to kiss ya
Every time you flash those eyes you make me reminisce ya
You’re looking fine, but I'd be lying, if I said I wanted you back

[Chorus]
I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back
I don’t want you back

The bigger the lies the harder they fall
The hotter the fire, the faster the love is gonna burn up
The hotter the fire, the smoke and the mirrors
Its clear I'm better off without ya

I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back
I don’t want you back

I don't even have my own attention
You say, ""Please don't ever change""
But you don't like me the way I am

The sign says ""Don't you tap the glass""
But I read it in reverse
""eht pat uoy t'nod syas ngis ehT""

The world tried to burn all the mercy out of me
But you know I wouldn't let it
It tried to teach me the hard way
I can't forget it

Driving down the coast again
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in

She said, ""I love you 'til I don't""
I am just playing house
No idea what I'm doing now

There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's getting to me
It's time to throw in the towel

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright
The sunshine

Call me Oluwaburna
I fell in love but I didn't fall down
Them say me nah normal
Drink Hennessy, me nah drink water
Make me stumble pon me Air Jordan

Ain't no slowing down, know I keep it rolling now
Smoking in my fuckin' brain
Passing through my fuckin' mind
Feel like I'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby
With the sun shining through
Got the blunt and the juice, cruise
Ridin' through the...

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
The sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright

Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I-I'm stuck in...)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun

[Verse 3: Patrick Stump]
You are my truest feeling yet
I love you so much, it's just like oxygen
And it's going to my head
A public meltdown, petulant but irreverent

Take all your possibilities then take away the limits
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
I do the best with what I have
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light

Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

[Verse 3]
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed?
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath

When you love someone, but it goes to waste

312,Wild LoveJames Bay,"[Verse 1]
Don't know what to say to you now
Standing right in front of you
Don't know how to fade in and out
Don't know how to play it cool
Lose a little guard, let it down
We don't have to think it through
We've got to let go

[Chorus]
I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love

[Verse 2]
Tried to call you, to feel you close
From a runway in Tokyo
Let's leave the atmosphere, disappear
There's always something left to lose

[Chorus]
But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
I wanna give you wild love

[Bridge]
(I wanna give you wild love)
(I wanna give you wild love)
Let's be reckless, unaffected
Running out until we're breathless
Let's be hopeful, don't be broken
Let's stay caught up in the moment

[Chorus]
But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
Oh I said I wanna give you wild love

[Outro]
Give you wild love
Wild love
Wild love

313,The MountainThree Days Grace,"[Intro]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

[Verse 1]
Another night I'm barely holdin' on
One step away from being dead and gone
Am I alive to die another day?
Is this life that I've been livin' all that's meant for me?

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

The higher I go, the harder I fall
So I don't look down, I don't look back at all
And when I wish it all would turn to black
I try to see the light and push the darkness back

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', I keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

[Bridge]
So if I'm not already too far gone
And if I feel a pulse then I can carry on
When I'm lost and wanna fade away
I tell myself to live, to die another day

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still alive and keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain, the mountain"

The long drive, the coastline
Lookin' out at first light
Am I still on her mind?
I've been undone

After all the clouds have gone
We can get together
She mixes the pineapple with dark rum
Says it’s because of the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re burning in the sunshine
She squeezes the lime
As the DJ on the stereo dropped the bassline
She told me she’s in love
With the speaker and the sub
And reggae makes her crazy

[Chorus]
Maybe it’s your eyes, how they pull me in
Maybe it’s your skin, either way I win
I don’t even know where to begin, girl
You’re just like paradise
All around the world they look for this
A little bit of sun and a pretty miss
Here I got you both I can’t resist, girl
Just like paradise

She called me up when my watch read one
Waiting in the lobby (you know what she wants to do)
The weekend is here and the work is done
She just wants to party

As the DJ on the stereo dropped the bassline
She told me she’s in love

Maybe it’s your eyes, how they pull me in
Maybe it’s your skin, either way I win

Plan every minute of our whole lives
We used to talk about it all night

A little bit of sun and a pretty miss
Oh, there’s nothing that you need to fix, girl

I only touched you once
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

Started with a little bit

I just wanna bury it

[Chorus]
I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

[Post-Chorus]
Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

[Verse 2]
Out into the unknown
We traded in our regrets
Not gonna go alone
'Cause we're gonna finish this

[Chorus]
I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

[Bridge]
Burn it all, set me free
And let the smoke blow on out to the sea
I need to find somewhere I can believe
I need to know there's a chance we can be
Burn it all, set me free
And let the smoke blow on out to the sea
I need to find somewhere I can believe
I need to know there's a chance we can be

[Chorus]
I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick up the phone

[Verse 1]
You said it yourself you're scared of being alone
You said it yourself that you can crack the code
But the static you hear automatically keeps you exposed, on your own
I hope you're ready, steady, smashing through the levy
The drama, the trauma, don't play the prima donna
My God
You said it yourself that you would never stop
Until you felt the needle drop

The silence, the silence
The blinding ultra violence
Knockin' at your door (Hey)
Pacin' back and forth
What now? (What now)

Love is like problems, we all got 'em

A dark night, remember, the sunrise, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Hands tied, remember, it's suicide to surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, I have a one track-mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

There is a method to the madness, to the madness

Float around town, made it official now
Think about you every now and again
There's been times, spendin days when I'm with you, girl
On my downtime, locking in, I take a ride around downtown
I'm not in the right town, come alive in the nighttime
Wasn't the right state, wasn't the right mind
Love is like problems, we all got 'em
How come when you stop a problem
Everybody problems become your problem?
Let 'em cry 'bout it, ain't my problem
Ain't my fault, Mystikal, Silkk the Shocker
Heard it's only thirty seconds to Mars
And it took you even less just to get to my heart

One track-mind, method to the madness

335,House On FireRise Against,"[Short Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, ""Move!""
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 2]
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 3]
And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

[Chorus]
'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I can't let go of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you"
336,Hurt SomebodyNoah Kahan,"[Verse 1]
Taking it slowly
I'm afraid to be lonely
Nobody told me
It's harder than I thought to tell the truth
It's gonna leave you in pieces
All alone with your demons
And I know that we need this
But I've been too afraid to follow through

[Chorus]
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

[Verse 2]
Don't know where the time went
Stuck in the wrong mindset
I let the rules bend
When I know that all along they're made to break
You got me searching for reasons
To keep me from leaving
At night I have trouble breathing
I give myself another chance to stay

[Chorus]
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

One day before you know it, you will see
All of the pain and all the irony
You'll feel the stinging and you'll think of me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt

Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody"

I want you to know I appreciate it

Mom I gotta go, the curtain's calling
All the way from Rome, I'm really sorry
Tell my little sister I said hey
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate

Yeah these late nights and these long drives
Full moon under dark skies
Tears fall behind phone screens
Lonely hearts lead to bad dreams
Wish that I could be there for you
I hope that life will be fair for you
It's hard to sleep cause I'm always thinking
And passing out off of codeine
And I hope you know that I'm not complaining
Hope you know I appreciate it
Every day is just filled with love
Man every day is just thanks and praises
But memories of your birthday, they get me in the worst ways
When you say, ""dad, it's okay.""
When you get home we can celebrate

Not the money, not the fame
Love the struggle, love the pain
After all that we have gained
We realize we're all the same
Sacrifice my brothers cried
We've been gone when family died
Losing my focus, symphonies open
Singing my opus, just think for a moment
One day I'll get home and we can throw a big party
Invite other people that helped us get started to
To all of you artists that feel a martyr
Don't ever give up, you just gotta go harder

Mom if you can hear me, I think I made it

Tell my little sister I said hey
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate

Every night feels like another weekend
Keep pretending that it's easy
Sold my soul for a wrecking ball
I shot at the moon but I mostly fall

Mom if you can hear me, I think I made it
20,000 fans from the stage I'm standing on
I want you to know I appreciate it
One day I'll come home, we can celebrate

346,Sky Full Of SongFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
How deeply are you sleeping or are you still awake?
A good friend told me you've been staying out so late
Be careful, oh, my darling, oh, be careful what it takes
From what I've seen so far, the good ones always seem to break
And I was screaming at my father and you were screaming at me
And I can feel your anger from way across the sea
And I was kissing strangers, I was causing such a scene
Oh, the heart it hides such unimaginable things

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

[Verse 2]
And I can tell that I'm in trouble when that music starts to play
In a city without seasons, it keeps raining in LA
I feel like I'm about to fall, the room begins to sway
And I can hear the sirens but I cannot walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (Shoot, shoot, shoot)
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (Fire)

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm too tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (Shoot, shoot, shoot)
And take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (Fire)"

349,Favorite Color Is BlueRobert DeLong + K.Flay,"[Verse 1]
Locked up, naked with socks
I'm watching the phone ring
It's making me angry
It's making me mad

Maxed out, minimum wage
My brain is a time bomb
I'm saying goodbye, Mom
I'll see you again

Striking a pose
Smiling in photos without any reason
With people that I'll never know
I'm outta control, living a fictional prose
I took an oath, it's killing me though
'Cause I don't believe in the things that I do

[Chorus]
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite

[Verse 2]
Roped up, rat in a cage
I'm having a breakdown
Drinking at a playground, tequila for one
Too short, walking the streets, I'm hating my haircut
You say that you're here, but
You live on the Sun

Burning a kite
I'm at a funeral, nothing unusual
Baby, I do what I like
Looking to fight, smoking a blunt and a pipe
Taking a bite, worm in the apple
I knew what would happen, 'cause honey the vermin survive
Swerve to the side, been driving all night

I'm thinking of changing my name, thinking of wrecking a home
'Cause loving and hating are one and the same
And I'm feeling like everyone's feeling alone
I'm just looking for something to soften the blow
A second inside of the truth
I don't see red 'cause

[Chorus 2]
Now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue
And now my favorite color is blue

350,SorryNothing But Thieves,"[Verse 1]
You might kill me with desire
Wind me tighter than a wire
It's something that you do to me
I run away like mercury
And I know you think it's rough
When you're tryna patch us up
And I say, ""Honey, what is love?""
You just say I drink too much

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm defective
Or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

[Verse 2]
And on the t-shirt that I wear
Pick the thorns out of my hair
I broke your heart so carelessly
But made the pieces part of me
And now it hurts what we've become
'Cause you taught me how to love
It's me who taught you how to stop
And you just say I drink too much

I never cared about the money, never really needed fame
You think it would've changed me but I've always been the same
My label tried to sue me, TMZ tried to screw me,
Blabbermouth can fuckin' suck it 'cause they never fuckin' knew me!
Everybody seems like they're waiting for me to die
Talk shit behind my back, can't look me in the eye!
They say I'm overrated, that I should've already faded;
Give a shit about it all because I love to be so hated

[Chorus]
All in all it's a good life; I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (It's all sham pain)

[Verse 2]
I barely get to eat and when I finally get to sleep
I get drug out of bed for another meet-and-greet
I shake the hand of every fan, put on a happy face;
Spread so fuckin' thin I'm all over the place
I hate riding on the bus, I hate flying in the planes;
Sedate myself just to kill the pain
I have no life, forgot the hope;
The whole thing's turned into one big joke

All in all it's a good life; I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now

I mean no disrespect, but I ain't picking up the check
Takin' selfies on your phone while you're breathing down my neck
Is getting pretty fuckin' old, and I'm almost nearly done;
I'm glad that you were happier when I was number one

Behold a new Christ
Behold the same old horde
Gather at the altering
New beginning, new word

Addicts of the immediate keep us obedient and unaware
Feeding this mutation, this Pavlovian despair

Disillusioned
So we run
Towards anything glimmering

Time to put the silicon obsession down
Take a look around
Find a way in the silence
Lie supine away with your back to the ground
Dis- and re-connect to the resonance now
You were never an island

Tuning
Into each other
Lift all higher

I will wait by the river
In the light of the moon
At the edge of the city
I will wait for you
Though I can't wait forever
Someday I'll be dead and gone
And I won't be forgiven
For what I've done

I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river

[Verse 2]
I will cry out to heaven
As it rains down on me
I will beg for forgiveness
Get down on my knees
If I can't change the weather
Maybe I can change your mind
If we can't be together
What's the point of life

[Bridge]
Baby, I didn't mean the things I said
I don't honestly wish you were dead
I'm a fool; I'm just a man
If I only could hold you again

[Verse 3]
And the stars fill the river
As it flows into the sky
And the mind leaves the body
And floats higher and higher
If we can't be together
I will leave this world behind
If I can't touch your body
Can I touch the sky?

I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river"

It's in your blood and it's in your making
So don't hold your tongue
'Cause it's, it's no longer working
Don't fall on your sword
Just follow your instinct
Like an old lesson learned
Like an old lesson learned

Only you know what it, what it is to see through
See through the eyes that are trained on me now
I can, I can only tell you how it, how it looks from here
I think you've made up your mind
I think you've made up your mind

Yes there's a lot we can
We can learn from this loss
Learn not to let it fall around our ears
Don't fall in love with the, with the way things were
It'll fuck up your mind, it'll fuck up your mind
But this is all on the wings of others
I loved you more
More in your own flight
So it ain't the same
It won't be lost forever
It won't be lost forever

Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever

Give all that you got on the sword
Don't say that you won't live forever

And I don't know why, and I don't know why
This is your grace

I trade goods for glory
I trade love for pain
I trade my tomorrows
If you just say my name
This [?] and this needle
This blood in my veins
I'm an innocent victim
On a runaway train

[Chorus]
But it's time to let go
It's time to break free
From these sins that I hold
And this blood that I bleed
Don't say goodbye
You don't have to hold on
The place where you come from is gone
The place where you come from is gone

[Verse 2]
I found God in the backseat
Of a stranger's used car
I found faith in the rumble
Of the stranger's guitar
I found love at the sea
In a stranger's blue eyes
And I found salvation
In a stranger's goodbye

[Chorus]
But it's time to let go
It's time to break free
From these sins that I hold
And this blood that I bleed
Don't say goodbye
You don't have to hold on

364,Four Out Of FiveArctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

[Verse 2]
Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice, I don't want to be nice
And you know that

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

[Bridge]
All the nights that never happened and the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it’s all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, now, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews, four stars out of five

[Outro]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five"

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

[Verse 2]
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

[Chorus]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

Take me back to the night we met

I don't wanna die alone

I've always walked alone
I chose the path less taken
I refuse to let you win
Life's a bitch and I've been shaken
It's not a joke at all
Inside my spirit's fading
I refuse to take the fall
'Cause no one cares at all

Wake me up, when this is over
I'm tired of living life like it's a dream
Please wake me up, when it's all over

Nobody teaches you to hurt like this

Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Yeah, we slide into the arms of someone else

In disguise, we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight

371,King Of The CloudsPanic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
Heaven knows that I'm born too late
For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

[Chorus]
I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

[Verse 2]
Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I don't feel anything
At all

[Chorus]
I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
Imagination, take me somewhere I don't know
I'm lost but I better find it alone
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

372,AfricaWeezer,"[Verse 1]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Verse 2]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

While I slip into the great divide

Going down with my wings on fire
Guess I'll see you in another life
Stepping out of body
You can tell everybody

All is not lost
My veins are seething
I can feel the freedom
Let them talk
It's not about the crown
We could share the kingdom

This is suicidal honey
Nothing you can do about it
Let me take the check with the reckless abandon on it
Just call me kamikaze"

385,Give Yourself A TryThe 1975,"[Verse 1]
You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 2]
I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like

[Chorus]
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 3]
And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard
And whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?"

389,Crossing A LineMike Shinoda,"[Chorus]
They’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line

[Verse 1]
I don’t know how to warn you
For what I’m gonna say
'Cause you’re holding so tight to
What I’m taking away
I got demons inside me
So I’m faced with a choice
Either try to ignore them
Or I give them a voice

And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
Holding back things you don’t know
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright

And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line

It’s not about status
We know it never was
'Cause what good is the kingdom
When you’re missing the love?
This is not a goodbye now

But I do have the faith

Oh, and it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
Holding back things you don’t know

396,GhostBadflower,"[Verse 1]
I tried it once before but I didn't get too far
I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up
I tried it once before and I think I might've messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be

[Verse 2]
I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough
And I should've told my mother, ""Mom, I love you,"" like a good son
But this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be, yeah

I tried it once again and I think I might black out
I should've left a letter but I had nothing to write about
My blood is all around me, I get dizzy if I stand up
The cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked

Yeah, take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be
I tried it once again and I think I went too far
(The man that I was meant to be)
I cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart

Maybe it was two times?

It can't be more than four times

You text that boy sometimes

Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you

Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made

They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors

Wait, habits here too, you’re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell

409,Alone In A RoomAsking Alexandria,"[Verse 1]
I've been away a little while, sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind's runnin' wild, I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard the crazy things the voices tell me to do
But it's no use
I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me, I've tried, in the end, I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

[Verse 2]
I saw the world a couple of times, tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole and my mind kept playin' tricks on me
Feelin' older every day, took everything I had to not crash and burn
But I'm starting to learn
Sometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here
So I keep pushin' the limits of what makes me me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

[Post-Chorus]
(Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely)

I can be better than I was
I can be better than I am
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room"

Ignite the fire inside of me
Embrace the life of tragedy
A tide of war and broken dreams

Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart of atrophy

Rising vapors through clocks of gold
Gilding fire unchain the demons

The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain

Nightfall haunts us all from the shadows
Cynical beauty now lights the halls
Before the flicker there's only blackness
The end is coming and all my friends are dead

The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain

It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power

[Verse 2: Hozier]
It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus: Hozier & Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power

And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power

And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to
Rattle your chains if you love being free

[Chorus: Hozier & Mavis Staples]
But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power

Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power

Oscillate yourself tonight
When you're in your bed
Simulate the dopamine
Passing through your head

When you get back on a Saturday night
And the room is caving in

Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

See yourself in Cupid's lake
Chipped in your head
Do you indicate to satellites
Passing by the edge?

Left her heart in a letter
Said she'd never been better
But now I know
My original sin
She is down once again
No, no

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been so long
Can't remember the last time, you know
It's been so long
So I'm on my way

[Chorus]
I can't see the road through the driving rain
But I won't stop now
Her love is calling me home, seems to guide the way
So I won't stop now

[Verse 2]
To avoid all confusion
She said she's been using
No, not again
Oh, but my fear of losing
The girl always gets me home
'Cause she knows

It's been so long
Still some things will never change, I know
It's been so long
So I'm on my way

I can't see the road through the driving rain
But I won't stop now
Her love is calling me home, seems to guide the way
So I won't stop now

She's the dark to light
She's never satisfied
She always seems to find a reason to hope
That I'll come back tonight
That I will wanna rise
She pulled my strings yet again
So, here we go

I can't see the road through the driving rain
But I won't stop now
Her love is calling me home, seems to guide the way
So I won't stop now
I can't see the road through the driving rain
But I won't stop now
Her love is calling me home, seems to guide the way
So I won't stop now

And I won't stop now
So I won't stop now"

417,WavesDean Lewis,"[Verse 1]
There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark
And I feel its warmth
In my hands, in my heart
But why can't I hold on?

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

[Chorus]
And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

[Verse 2]
Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

[Bridge]
I've watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does

[Chorus]
And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away"

Move!

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that ""if"" and ""when"" are truly different cries
For ""if"" is purely panic and ""when"" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

[Verse 2]
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Bridge]
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder

What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)

What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, ""How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king""

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them""
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated"

I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it

In City, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

432,Ridetwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize (Size, size)

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you

I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene

I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

The reason to have been here

Reclaims our footprints
And while our bones keep looking back
At the overgrowth that's swallowing the path
There for the grace of God go we
There for the grace of God go we
There for the grace of time and chance
And entropy's cruel hands
So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build 'til we've blistered our hands
So won't you stay here with me

Build us some castles
Build us some monuments
And burn them all right down

So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

Build us some castles

I'm like a child looking off in the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
Oh I'm still alive

I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Oh I'm still alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

Are you scared to death to live?

444,CleopatraThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans

And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Verse 2]
While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Bridge]
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

[Verse 3]
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

[Outro]
I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time"

A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel, I appreciate the time, I'm not alone

Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize

Guiding me to her arms

Before a blow to the head
By the gavel of time to wake up
Won't you wake up?

Was now the only solution for them keeping the score?
Just wake up
Can't you wake up?

I don't take these things so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl
I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

Robots are my next of kin

[Verse 3]
I'm kissing high and low our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret
I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?

467,How Did You LoveShinedown,"[Verse 1]
You can have the sound of a thousand voices calling your name
You can have the light of the world blind you, bathe you in grace
But I don't see so easily what you hold in your hands
'Cause castles crumble, kingdoms fall and turn into sand

[Verse 2]
You can be an angel of mercy or give into hate
You can try to fight it just like every other careless mistake
How do you justify, I'm mystified by the ways of your heart
With a million lies the truth will rise to tear you apart

Wooaahh!

[Chorus]
No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love?

[Verse 3]
Nothing ever feels quite the same when you are what you dreamed
And you will never look at anything the same when you see what I see
How we forget ourselves, lose our way, from the cradle to the grave
You can't replicate, or duplicate, gotta find your own way

Yeeaahh!

No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?

How did you love?

It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?

How did you love?

This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury
This ain't no cross to bury

I met up with an acrobat
In Brooklyn or some place like that
With life and taxis flying past
We tore that dance hall down

Pocket change and subway cars
Our big ideas filled empty bars
You might be from the moon or Mars
Either way, I'm never going home

So, let's hang an anchor from the sun
There’s a million city lights but

I was drinking from the wishing well
Some junkie metal-head hotel

The bankers in the lion's den
Were dropping lines like beggars in the snow

477,MonsterStarset,"[Verse 1]
Under the knife I surrendered
The innocence yours to consume
You cut it away
And you filled me up with hate
Into the silence you sent me
Into the fire consumed
You thought I’d forget
But it’s always in my head

[Chorus]
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
You're the love that I hate
You're the drug that I take
Will you cage me?
Will you cage me?
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
From the monster you made me?
The monster you made me?

This is the world you've created
The product of what I've become
My soul and my youth
Seems it's all for you to use
If I could take back the moment
I let you get under my skin
Relent or resist?
Seems the monster always wins

[Chorus]
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?

My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul
I'll lift you up and then I'll let you go
I've made an art of digging shallow holes
I drop the darkness in and watch it grow
My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul
Who knew the emptiness could be so cold?
I've lost the parts of me that make me whole
I am the darkness
I'm a monster

[Chorus]
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
You're the love that I hate

There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walkin' around with a limp an' a hunch
Sayin' stuff like, ""You only live once""
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talkin' about

Before it slips away

[Chorus 1: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up, I found love

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
You say something loving
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar

Before it slips away

[Verse 3: Romy Madley Croft]
Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

So I won't shy away
Should it all fall down
You'll have been my favourite mistake

You are dangerous, but I don't care

If they call us reckless
Until they are breathless
They must be blind

You are dangerous, but I don't care
I'm going to pretend that I'm not scared

If I'm beating every hand away
No one stays
I've got so cautious
And now I choke on every move I make
Let one play
To be that careless

With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud… for me to hear?

Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
Try as I might
With every beat comes a violent noise
The melody's sung
And I don't know the voice
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise

You've been staying out late
Trying your best to escape
I hope you find what you're looking for
Let a moment take place
Without running away
I hope you silence the noise

How could eyes this wide
Lose sight of a world outside?
I've looked away, cowardice

Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud… for me to hear?

I don’t like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

[Chorus: Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything’s about me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?"

496,All Around YouSturgill Simpson,"[Verse 1]
There will be days
When the sun won't shine
When it seems like the whole world is against you
Don't be afraid
Life is unkind
You can let go of the pain if you choose to

'Cause time slips away
Skies fall apart
It ain't too hard
A universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you

There will be nights that go on forever
Like you're long-lost at sea
Never to be found
Just know in your heart
That we're always together

And so is love
God is inside you
All around you
And up above
Growing, showing, you the way

And when my heart won't break
An empty space between my lungs
And when my knees won't shake
I'll drink to find inspiration
'Cause I'm a red blooded man
When I can't see behind the sun (I can't see behind the sun)
A supernatural plan
Is coming to meet me now

Living life with no need for the brakes

But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes

[Chorus 2]
Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

Addressing those beneath from high above
Convincing his belief for what you love

Another charlatan to idolize

Is this suppression just in my mind? (Just in my mind?)
No more questions, get back in line! (Just get back in line!)

[Chorus]
You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)

The gears forever turn to grind the mice
Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
Power absolutely all for show
The piper blows his flute and off you go

Why do I feel like the fault is mine?

Why must the weakest be sacrificed?

No more questions, get back in line!
(Just get back in line!)

[Chorus]
Pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away (Wither away)
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (To feed the machine)

I'll just keep on throwing middle fingers in the air

500,Tearing Me UpBob Moses,"[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a little situation
It's been testing my patience, man
She was keeping me up all night
'Cause you only get so far reading faces
We were off to the races
And I thought to myself, ""Hold tight""
You see there was just this one complication
She was already taken
And what was so wrong felt so right
She said, ""No need to be looking over your shoulder
When you could just come over
And we could work this out just fine""

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
Slow me down, playing by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you

[Chorus]
If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
And I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up

[Verse 2]
It all started with a simple conversation
It was all in the making, man
She was talking me up all night
Kept asking if I was only faking
She was there for the taking
Showing me that she was all mine
She told me she lived just around the corner
I wanted to know her
Ya, she was making me lose my mind
I didn't know quite what I was chasing
She had my heart racing
And all it took was just one night

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
Slow me down, playing by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you

[Chorus]
If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
And I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
Slow me down, playing by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you

[Chorus]
If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
And I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up"
501,Cold Cold ColdCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
Doctor, look into my eyes
I've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life
Doctor, the problem's in my chest
My heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess

Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right

Counselor, give me some advice
Tell me, how hard will I fall if I live a double life?

[Pre-Chorus]

Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right

And as the darkness falls, it fills up both my eyes
My life before me like a flash in the night
With my arms open wide

Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me? Cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right
Something just ain't right"
502,Lost On YouLP,"[Verse 1]
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers, falling tender
Long before the days of no surrender
Years ago
And well you know?


[Pre-Chorus 1]
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
Cause I don't know how

[Chorus]
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you
Is that lost on you?

[Verse 2]
Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine

[Pre-Chorus]
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around

[Chorus]
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Bridge:
Lost on you
Lost on you

Is that lost on you?"
503,AloneI Prevail,"[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser]
We used to have it all
It was us against the world, but now
I've been sleeping on my own
Spending all these nights alone, knowing you're not coming home

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
'Cause you're running through my dreams
It's like you're on repeat
Feels like eternity
And I can't believe

I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone
I let you in, you bled me out
You left me skin and bone, you left me all alone

You left me all alone

'Cause you're running through my dreams
It's like you're on repeat
Feels like eternity

I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone
I let you in, you bled me out

And to be honest, I know I'll never be the same
I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone

You left me all alone

[Bridge: Brian Burkheiser]

I'll leave the light on, I'll leave the light on
When it's too dark to see

I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone
I let you in, you bled me out
You left me skin and bone, you left me all alone

You left me on my own, you left me all alone"
504,Moving On And Getting OverJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time

[Verse 2]
Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

[Bridge]
Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

[Verse 3]
Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
And I sure would like to see you one more time

It's taken me so long just to say ""so long""
And baby it's so wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl
A something-I-can-do-girl
To try to get me through, girl
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby

Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure?

There was a wayward lad
Stepped out one morning
The ground to be his bed
The sky his awning

[Verse 2: Joe Newman]
Neon, neon, neon
A blue neon lamp in a midnight country field
Cows surround so you lean on, lean on
So much your hugs become hold ons

[Chorus: Joe Newman + Gus Unger-Hamilton]
Oh, these three worn words
Oh, that we whisper
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language

[Verse 3: Joe Newman]
Well, that smell of sex
Good like burning wood
The wayward lad lay claim
To two thirsty girls from Hornsea
Who left a note when morning came:

[Bridge: Ellie Rowsell]
""Girls from the pool say, ""Hi"" (Hi)
The road erodes at five feet per year
Along England's east coastline
Was this your first time?
Love is just a button we pressed
Last night by the camp fire""

Oh, these three worn words
Oh, that we whisper
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona

Been rusting in the rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint

Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain

Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again, and again

[Chorus]
How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

Rolling down the ancient high street you'll find

Can you make your way out?
In a world dearly won
Well it's yours love
You can move it around
Given all the drops in the ocean
Better take it one sip at a time
Somebody with an antique notion
Comes along to tighten the line
They're just afraid of you speaking your mind

They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name?
They got a name for everything
All of the clothes that you wear
And all of your bits and pieces yeah

You're flipping through the check-stand rags it appears
There ain't no time to waste, you're getting on in years
You can keep your can up
If you just never eat again
It's a means to a terrible end
Even if your plan is successful
Have you really got room in your life?
Yeah and it's a bland kind of torture
You've played the mother and wife
But what do you really dream of at night?

[Chorus]
They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name?
They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name?

Like you don't know?

If I had nothing to my name
But photographs of you
Rescued from the flame
That is all I would ever need
As long as I can read
What's written on your face

The strength that shines behind your eyes
The hope and light that will never die

[Chorus]
And one promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
As we've always done

[Verse 2]
And you said: ""the poison in a kiss is the lie upon the lips""
Truer words were never shared
When I feel like lies are all I hear
I pull my memories near, the one thing they can't take

And one promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
As we've always done

The books still open on the table
The bells still ringing in the air
The dreams still clinging to the pillow
The songs still singing in a prayer

Now my soul is stretching through the roots
To memories of you
Back through time and space
To carry home
The faces and the names
And photographs of you, rescued from the flames

[Chorus]
One promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
And dare to rise once more
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
And fill the world with life
As we've always done"

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA
See the faces of the people as they run away
It's a permanent made distraction, the modern reaction
The people don't have to feel the dissatisfaction
It's a slow journey up but a quick ride on down
And nobody here knowing their way around
From the top of the world every which way is down
And who's gonna take the crown?

'Cause I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're keeping me low (But you're keeping me low)
I don't got time to waste or time to kill

How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need

528,Good Goode',"[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

[Verse 2]
Rosie
You don't have to hide his things
I'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
Whoa-oh-oh, Rosie
Don't you know my love is true
'Perdon' and 'lo siento', see, I learned those words for you

Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune"
531,Still Feel Like Your ManJohn Mayer,"[Intro]
I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man

[Verse 1]
The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can

[Chorus]
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

[Verse 2]
I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there

[Chorus]
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man, oh mama
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man, your man

[Bridge]
(Ever since the day we met, ever since the day we met)
Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, be—

[Chorus]
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
(I still feel like) Still feel like your man (oh honey)
Still feel like your man

I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man (And I don't know why)
Still feel like your man

I still feel like
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still, I still"
532,Never On The Day You LeaveJohn Mayer,"[Chorus]
No it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave

[Verse 1]
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

[Chorus]
No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave

[Verse 2]
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man

[Chorus]
No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave

[Bridge]
So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave"
533,AndromedaGorillaz,"[Verse 1: 2-D]
When the pulsing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Where it all goes down

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
I put it to the right man
He put it back

[Bridge: 2-D]
Caught in your eyes
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart

Mama Mavis, oh, Mama, they tried my patience
{Obama} is gone, who is left to save us?
{Orlando,} we mourn, I'm praying for my neighbors
They say the devil's at work and {Trump} is calling favors
You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands

You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Refrain: 2-D]
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
But until then, I keep my piece in arm's reach

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark) Another night
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change coming
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?

All the world is out of your hands

You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change, oh, change is coming
You'd best be ready

Be ready, ready for it
Be ready, be ready

535,Don't Take The MoneyBleachers,"[Verse 1: Jack Antonoff]
Somebody broke me once
Love was a currency
A shimmering balance act
I think that I laughed at that
And I saw your face and hands
Coloured in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shave my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
I slept on my own those nights
Was still in my parents' house
And I cut off my t-shirt sleeves
And claim a new continent
'Til I saw your face and hands
Covered in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shake my head

We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)

[Bridge: Jack Antonoff]
When you're looking at your shadow
Standing on the edge of yourself
Praying on the darkness
Just don't take the money
Dreaming of an easy
Waking up without weight now
And you're looking at the heartless
Just don't take the money

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff & Lorde]
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Well, don't take the money
(Baby love me you've got me, runaway)
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money

A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

[Chorus 2]
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

538,HighSir Sly,"[Verse 1]
I’ve been smoking on the peace pipe
I’ve been wondering just what would peace be like
I’ve been staring into headlights
Swallow me whole, finding my peace of mind
I’m just trying to seize the moment
Trying to love the little things, even if they’re hard to love
A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone, “Unwilling to come undone”

[Chorus 1]
It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I’m up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

[Verse 2]
I remember back in Oakland
I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
Moving hotel to hotel
Out on the road, no idea really what’s in store
Light it up just like a flashlight
Let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun
Turn it over and it’s capsized
It’s finally done, the battle's lost, yet I feel I’ve won

[Chorus 1]
It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I’m up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

[Post-Chorus]
It feels good for the first time in a long time now
It feels good to be me

[Chorus 2]
I’m high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I’m along for the ride as I’m taking flight

[Chorus 2]
I’m high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I’m along for the ride as I’m taking flight

[Chorus 1]
It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I’m up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

[Post-Chorus]
It feels good for the first time in a long time to be me
It feels good for the first time in a while I’m free

[Chorus 2]
I’m high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I’m along for the ride as I’m taking flight"

Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya 
They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up

The roof is on fire, she wet like Barbra Streisand

So don't be coming 'round Vince on that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit, need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with, them slave bones make Grace Jones

Attack on Iraq, it's on a line
Typing it fast, then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk, I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage 'cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition, well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness and recalling it all
And I’m a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-

All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn {Obama} to my partner 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag

Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree

Oh honey
You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me

What do we do

Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me

Every time I'm with it alone
It picks me up
You just send me down

You're a cage won't you let me in?
On my toes
Lock the door
Pretty face
Through the walls
Don't know if I'd be so sure again

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

Every time I'm stuck in the ground
Spin me round, won't you spin me round
You're a void, a crack in the mirror
See me now, if you could see me now
You slipped through
The night
Then walked out
Skin tight
But you don't matter that much to me
No you don't matter that much to me

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out
So turn the lights out
Just turn the lights out

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out"

On the lam cut down in the middle of the night caught in a trap
Crushed by the crown of the wandering man who was never coming back
Stuck on the line spending all of his time with his back to the throne
With the flash of the round everybody in town said ""Leave it alone""

Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let it go

I got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight facing the ground
Beast of the wild with a porcelain smile as it passes around
The truth in disguise from the billowing eyes isn't working on me
Don't you think you gotta give
Give me something I want
Give me something I need

[Chorus]
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

One last drink to drink wishful thinkin'
And then another again
The bar is getting brighter
And the walls are closin' in

Journey on the jukebox singin'
Don't let the believin' end
The one that you had eyes for
Had their eyes for your best friend

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight

If you roll it on home

The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday

I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

[Verse]
I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing

Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don’t got one
So we'll build one of our own

Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can’t change my ways

I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing

[Bridge]
Time's been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying “Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart”
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing

I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

549,Like A StoneAudioslave,"[Verse 1]
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone

[Bridge]
And on I read, until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone"

552,Want You BackHAIM,"[Verse 1: Danielle]
Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart

[Verse 2: Danielle & Este & Alana]
I said we were opposite lovers
Said it from the beginning
You kept trying to prove me wrong
Said you’d always see it through
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

[Chorus]
But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

I know it’s hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don’t take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself

[Verse 4: Danielle & Este & Alana]
And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you’d always see me through
All that time is gone, no more fearing control
I’m ready for the both of us now

[Chorus]
So just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you back

Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

567,Feels Like SummerWeezer,"[Verse 1]
Climbing up the tower
Just a boy and his computer
I'm still in my bathrobe
Hiding in the shadows
I'm not used to losing
Bye, bye, sugar blue eyes
You're home with the angels
Thank you for being so kind

[Chorus]
I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go, whoa-oh-oh
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
And she was a lover to me, to me, to me, to me

[Verse 2]
Which way is the graveyard?
I'm an iceberg with a warm heart
I'm spiritual, not religious
I'm a Libra, if it matters
Shattered by an email
Your words will fade away
Castle built in the sand
Will only last one day

[Chorus]
I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go, whoa-oh-oh
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
When she was a lover to me

June bride, shine so bright
Flowers in her hair, but it just ain't right
June bride, shine so bright
Flowers in her hair, we look good together
We look good together

Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
When she was a lover to me

Let me see the smile, stay with me awhile
I cry for you, you were the song in my life"
568,26Paramore,"[Verse 1]
Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine, until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

[Verse 2]
You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

[Bridge]
Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody

But I wouldn't care what it cost me"
569,PoolParamore,"[Verse 1]
As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
Could've gotten the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new?
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, would you come through?
Happy second chance or happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

[Chorus]
(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

[Verse 2]
As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

[Chorus]
(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you

If I survive, I'll dive back in

When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground
You must find a way

576,The ViolenceRise Against,"[Verse 1]
Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or was it all a dream?

The bombs are getting closer everyday
""That can never happen here"" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough or is it all a dream?

[Verse 2]
To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream

So can we break this mold?
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

[Bridge]
Well trodden paths are all we take
We need a storm; let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from the shadows
And into the light

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream..."

Sick and tired, picking up from the dirty floor

If you take a step towards me, you will take my breath away
So I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
No one else has ever loved me, no one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take
Then I saw the worst was over when I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place
Out of all the vast illusions, out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face

[Chorus]
If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too

[Verse 2]
Let me take a step towards you, let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads
There's a darkness down inside me that I know we'll both enjoy
And it's screaming from within to set it free
I have left this bloody nightmare in my wake but out of sight
All I want is deviation by design
Out of all the past confusion, out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours, 'cause you are mine

And if you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm

Ah!
Something in the middle of the side of the store
Got your attention, you would ask for more
I was excited to be part of your world
To belong, to be lost, to be mostly the two of us
Something I was stealing for no reason at all
They hang me higher than a disco ball
But you talked them into letting me go
It's no Picasso, Michelangelo

Something 'bout the jewels you wear
Shiny, shiny bangles on your wrists
And at the Masquerade ball
You feel trapped in a vault, in an empty aquarium
If suddenly you're out of the woods
Then inside of an alley, you're out of words
Well, I thought it was radium at first

[Chorus]
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than that, we're chained
And there's no else to blame
For us two

[Verse 2]
Some things, they don't matter till they matter to you
They stole that money from a homeless girl
The truth is we're all to blame
There are lies and moral consequences
We started at the end of the line
To end up giving up to a couple, who cares?
When you talked me into letting you go
No more coral on the atoll

Something 'bout how hard you learned
Kamikaze in a hopeless world
Do you remember the last time you laughed
And I laughed and you left and I left?
Send me on the lonely other side of the world
With a couple of guys and no alphabet
Put two and two together
We'll make it last forever

[Chorus]
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad? Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than that, we're chained
And there's no else to blame
For us two

When reaper calls, may it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns, may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When we’re seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

[Pre-Chorus]
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

[Chorus 1]
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

[Verse 2]
When all is pain, may it be
It’s all we’ve ever known
When flame consumes, may it be
It warms our dying bones
When loss has won, may it be
It’s you I’m madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be
We walk right through that open door

[Pre-Chorus]
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

[Chorus 1]
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future

We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever"
582,Doing It For The MoneyFoster The People,"[Chorus 1]
Just close your eyes
We’re gonna run this blind
We live our lives
Yeah, we’re not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We’re gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
But we’re not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

[Verse 1]
Is it wrong to write the rules?
We gotta strike a match to light the fuse
Now I’m never looking back
It’s time to leave the future in the past

[Pre Chorus 1]
I said it doesn’t matter where I go I am
Calling all the poets into battle I am
Shouting to the world let them know that we won’t
Be afraid to step into the fight
When we can’t see the light

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
We’re gonna run this blind
We live our lives
Yeah, we’re not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We’re gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
But we’re not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

[Verse 2]
Well, if you’re down then soldier up
You better learn to shoot or learn to duck
There’s no retreat and no escape
If we keep dreaming while we’re wide awake

[Pre Chorus 2]
I said it doesn’t matter where I go I am
Calling all the prophets into battle I am
Never going to change who I am I won’t
Bend under the pressure when my back’s on the ropes
I said it doesn’t matter where I go I am
Staring down the barrel of a gun we are
Shouting to the world let them know that we are
Not afraid to step into the fight
When you can’t see the light

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
We’re gonna run this blind
We live our lives
Yeah, we’re not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We’re gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
But we’re not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

[Bridge]
Well it’s a silicon rush
And I’m addicted
I don’t understand
When it starts I can’t switch
Saying what I won’t do
Well pleasure comes as pain too
But mostly it’s an afterthought
And it’s slowly coming after you

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
We’re gonna run this blind
We live our lives
Yeah, we’re not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We’re gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
But we’re not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money"
583,Suit And JacketJudah,"[Verse 1]
I ain't trading my youth for no suit and jacket
I ain't giving my freedom for your money and status
So don't say I'm getting older
Cause I'll say it when I do

[Chorus]
Cause everybody I know, everybody I know
Is growing old, is growing old too quickly
And I don't wanna go
So how am I supposed to slow it down so I can figure out who I am?

Some of us just roaming
Some of us just hoping the world will move more slowly
And some of us alive
We're all gonna die one day

Some of us just roaming
Some of us just hoping the world will move more slowly
And some of us alive
We're all gonna die one day

I'm cornered in fire, so break out the secrets
I hope you know that you were worth it all along
I'm tired, you're angry, and everyone looks blurry
I love you, I'm leaving, so long

[Chorus 1]
Hey, little one
I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only friend
My little one

[Verse 2]
The places I took you, they seem so fucking empty
I have trouble going anywhere at all
Especially my own bedroom
Yeah, and it stays awake to haunt me
So I'll pass out, blackout drunk in another bathroom stall

[Chorus 2]
Hey, little one
I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only friend
How long must I justify my pain through these songs?
How long? how long?

Hey, little one
I'm so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only little one

585,In The EndLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
586,NumbLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

587,Po-DunkKid Rock,"[Verse 1]
Momma looking good in some jeans all ripped
Got a baby in her belly and a baby on her hip
Little toe headed rascal peeing off the porch
Daddy got a shotgun looking for a stork
Oh lord

[Chorus]
And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!

[Verse 2]
Bible by the bed and a bottle sitting pretty
Pigskin on the TV, bacon in a skillet
An ol' mutt in the yard lickin' on an itch
Bunch of fake flamingos flocking by the ditch
(Can I get a witness?!)

[Chorus]
And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
A yard full of chickens and a farm full of drunks
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o, Po-Dunk!

[Bridge]
Po-dunk

[Verse 3]
Put your adult beverage over your head
If you're bat shit crazy and your neck is red
As the dirt on the road where we all grew up
Sing something with me if you ain't nothing but...
(You ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but)

[Chorus]
Po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't

588,What I've DoneLinkin Park,"[Verse 1]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Verse 2]
Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself

589,CrawlingLinkin Park,"[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin

Controlling) Confusing what is real"
590,Somewhere I BelongLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong

Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream

And say what I don't mean

I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I’m trying to turn k’s to m’, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong"

So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Outro: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar"

Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around and we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes

599,My Mind Is For SaleJack Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Well, I heard the blinker's on
I heard we're changing lanes
I heard he likes to race
I heard that six or seven words he likes to use
Are always in bad taste
And I heard that Monday's just a word we say
Every seven times around
And then we pin the tail on Tuesday
Watch those strings go up and down
The elephant in the room begins to dance
The cameras zoom into
His mouth begins to move
Those hateful words he uses

[Chorus]
I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

[Verse 2]
And all the real estate in my mind is for sale
It's all been subdivided
Divided into reasons why
My two opposing thoughts at once are fine
The residue from the price tag
On the tip of my tongue
The words don't come they go
How many likes I gotta get
Before I know the truth
And the truth is
Season three will be a great reason
To forget all about reality's
A slippery slope
Watch the TV scream and shout it

[Chorus]
I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

[Verse 3]
Now I heard the blinker's on
I heard we're changing lanes
I heard we need more space
I heard that six or seven words are in bad taste
It's absurd to believe that we might
Deserve anything
As if its balanced in the end
And the good guys always win

[Chorus]
I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite
With the residue from the price tag
On those two opposing thoughts in my mind
Us against them fearful kind of walls"

Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?

On a fault line, late night
Underneath the stars we came alive

While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

[Verse 2]
We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

[Bridge]
When we laughed
When we cried
Those were the days
We owned the nights
Locked away
Lost in time
I found the nerve
To say that

[Chorus]
I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times"
614,Whole Wide WorldCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
""There's only one girl in this world for you
And she probably lives in Tahiti""

[Interlude]
Go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her

[Verse 2]
Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weeping in the tropical, moonlit night
Because nobody's talking 'bout you

[Chorus]
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
(Go! Hey!)

[Verse 3]
Am I hanging around in the rain right here
Trying to pick up a girl?
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world?
Is she lying on some tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun?
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long

[Pre-Chorus]
I should be lying on that sun-swept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year, or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

[Chorus]
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd the whole wide world
Just to find her
(Go! Woo!)

[Chorus]
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
(Oh! Go!)"
616,We Know Where You Fucking LiveMarilyn Manson,"[Verse 1]
Let's make something clear
We're all recording this as it happens
No diamond-bullet storefront-blood-bank
Splinters and stained glass

We don't need to move a single prayer bone
Dodge/burn so loud and sub-low
We don't need to move a single prayer bone
Hi-def is still life

[Pre-Chorus]
""So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?""
""So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?""

[Chorus]
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse

[Verse 2]
The world was stripped
Of its superficial surfaces
We don't intend to just eat the street
The asphalt is the good meat

And we will sleep on the skin of its nightmares
We will sleep on the skin of its nightmares
""It's time to just kill this crowd
And scream as fucking loud""

[Chorus]
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse

I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, I love it
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, I love it
I love it

[Refrain]
Fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire...

[Chorus]
We know where you fucking live

We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse

We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live

617,American DreamsPapa Roach,"[Verse 1]
It feels like, American Dreams caught on fire
We're tearing down the white picket fences
A soldier bleeds, and a soldier dies
Have you ever thought that war was a sickness?
I’m a son of it, fucked up from it
Casualty of my family cause of it
We dare to dream, or live to die
Reunited by the truth at the right time
Something’s wrong here
Or so it seems
'Cause I’m not sleeping in

[Chorus]
American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it's harder to breathe
When you're buried alive
By American Dreams

[Verse 2]
With every bullet hole, there's a blood stain
Another family that's struggling to keep sane
'Cause their neighborhood ain't a safe place
Got us all wearing black every Sunday
And I'm growing numb to the violence
Sing along to the sounds of the sirens
We're trying to keep ourselves alive
But it's hard to get by when it feels like
Something’s wrong here
Or so it seems
'Cause I'm not sleeping in

[Chorus]
American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it’s harder to breathe
When you're buried alive
By American Dreams

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not sleeping in
American Dreams, American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it's harder to breathe
When you’re buried alive
By American Dreams

I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

[Verse 1]
All the days you spend on my mind
All the times that I'd say that we'll be together, we'll be together, oh

Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

All the hours we've spent on the line
All the times that you'd say that I never listen, I never listen
Through the conversations we've had 'til 4 AM
You say you want something different, want something different

619,Living On The 110Prophets Of Rage,"[Verse 1: B-Real]
Living on the 110
Four sharing one tent
Can't afford no rent
Forgotten by the government
Feels like a life time
Stuck and struck down
Waiting for the right time
Running out of luck now
And it's damn shame
See it from the fast lane
Living in the jungle
Tent city struggle
You drive by see the family camped out
By the underpass
You got your blinders on
You want to hit the gas

[Chorus: B-Real, Chuck D]
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You pretend there's democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You depend on democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality

[Verse 2: B-Real, Chuck D]
I lost my home
So I roam wherever
And my belly's on E
And I gots no cheddar
Life gets no better
And my plate is empty
And my mind is hungry
Ain't got no penny
Sidewalk sleeping
Trying to keep on breathing
The hopeless pray
Trying to keep believing
A ghost you're seeing
Left behind by the system
You can see me southbound on Exposition

[Chorus: B-Real, Chuck D]
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You pretend there's democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You depend on democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality

[Bridge]
You better hope and pray

[Chorus: B-Real, Chuck D]
Living on the 110

This is the reality

She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on""

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon

It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again"

Well, I started out down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, the world got still

I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

[Verse 2]
Well, the good old days may not return
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

Break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there

But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down

In Los Ageless, the winter never comes

The lost sages hang out by the bar
Burn the pages of unwritten memoirs
But I can keep running
Oh I can keep running

The last days of the sunset superstars
Girls in cages playing their guitars
But how can I leave?
I just follow the hood of my car
In Los Ageless, the waves they never break
They build and build until you don't have no escape
But how can I leave?
I just follow my hood to the sea, go to sleep

Have you cried yourself to sleep?
Have you felt this incomplete?
Have you ever cut yourself so deep
To see if you still bleed?
Do you ever feel wanted?
Do you ever feel needed?
Do you ever feel happy?
Or are you just like me?

[Chorus]
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
Love falls out of me

[Verse 2]
Have you ever wished for death?
And prayed all night for your last breath?
Have you ever wanted to forget
The failure of your dreams?
Because I've never felt wanted
And I've never felt needed
And I'll never be happy
But I guess that's just me

[Chorus]
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me

[Bridge]
I'll never forget the day I died
The memories frozen and denied
Flower of my heart withered and dried

[Chorus]
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me

[Chorus/Outro]
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
Love falls out of me"

Always looking up for higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

630,Ex's & Oh'sElle King,"[Verse 1]
Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been cursin' my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

[Chorus 1]
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

[Verse 2]
I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
My, my, how the seasons go by
I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
You know that's how the story goes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

My ex’s and the oh, oh, oh’s they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make ‘em oh, oh, oh

631,Stressed Outtwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

635,IrresistibleFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA

And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah

I love the way you hurt me, baby

I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name

And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)

You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey, I don't know
What you're doing to me,  mon chéri
But the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war

[Chorus]
And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

I love the way you hurt me, baby"

From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

[Breakdown]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

Come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Hey, boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
""Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself""
It's just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Verse 2]
This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm giving it up, giving it up again

And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time

641,The Sound Of SilenceDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence"""

But when I’m cold, cold
When I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feeling within me, everglow

And we swore on that night, we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I’m gonna miss you, I know

[Chorus 2]
But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show

647,The LightDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
Turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You waited, hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow reckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away

[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light

[Verse 2]
An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid to turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind and
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory

[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light

[Bridge]
Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you

[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
Don't ignore
Listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light"
648,ThroneBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!

[Verse 2]
The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my… throne

[Bridge]
I'll leave you chokin' on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)
I'll leave you chokin' on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

[Chorus]
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne"

With everyone just wash it all away

For anyone to wash it all away
Wash it all away

If only you had known me before the accident
For with that grand collision, came a grave consequence
Receptors overloaded; they burst and disconnect
Til there was little feeling, please work with what is left

[Verse 2]
Oh, I need not be flattered, that you've never been here before
So there’s no need to mention, that you've no firsts anymore
But if you let me be your skyline, I’ll let you be the wave
That reduces me to rubble, but looked safe from far away

I don’t know why, I don’t know why I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive

Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

Lost in between our needs and wants

For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams

Into life, I’ve just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

It’s time to get down, dirty up our knees in the battle
Come on, round up the boys, gonna make the walls rattle
Oh, our flag is tattered
And our bones are shattered

What I give, it takes away
Whether I go or when I stay
I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
I see a fire out by the lake
I'll drive my car without the brakes
I see a mountain in my way
It's looming larger by the day
I see a darkness in my fate
I'll drive my car without the brakes

Every time I stare into the sun
Trying to find a reason to go on
All I ever get is burned and blind
Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain

When you came along, the time was right
Pulled me like an apple, red and ripe
Wasn't very long, you took a bite
And did me wrong, and it serves me right

[Chorus]
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go 'round, again
Again

Every little key unlocks the door
Every little secret has a lie
Try to take a picture of the sun
And it won't help you to see the light

Every little word upon your lips
Makes a little cut where blood pours out
Every little drop of blood, a kiss
That I won't miss, not for anything

[Chorus]
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go 'round, again

Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole in the head

Said, ""Pull yourself together, you should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together, oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Chorus 1]
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

667,Thank God For GirlsWeezer,"[Verse 1]
The girl in the pastry shop with the net in
Her hair is making a cannoli for you
To take on your hiking trip in the woods with
Your bros that you’ve known since second grade
And you may encounter dragons or ruffians and be
Called upon to employ your testosterone
In a battle for supremacy and access
To females glued to the TV
And even if you are victorious
You may receive many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
And when you come home she will
Be there waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove in your mouth
And that's why you

[Chorus]
Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe
From Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day
You better bow down and pray

She’s so strong
She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls
Thank God for girls

[Verse 2]
I'm so glad I got a girl to think of even though she isn't mine
I think about her all the day and all the night
It's enough to know that she's alive
She says I give her sweaty palms
She almost had a heart attack
The truth is that I’m just as scared I don’t know how to act
I wish that I could get to know her better
But meeting up in real life would cause the illusion to shatter
I carved her name into all the trees
Sang a song down on one knee
Looking at the underwear page of the Sears catalog
Like when I was 14
I’m levitating like a magnet turned the wrong way around
I’m like an Indian Fakir tryna’ meditate on a bed of nails with my pants pulled down

[Chorus]
Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe
From Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day
You better bow down and pray

She’s so strong
She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls

[Coda]
God took a rib from Adam, ground it up in a centrifuge machine
Mixed it with cardamom and cloves, microwaved it on the popcorn setting
While Adam was like “that really hurts”
Going off into the tundra, so pissed at God
And he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
Messing with the bees who were trying to pollinate the echinacea
Until God said, “I'm a smite you with loneliness
And break your heart in two”
And Adam wept and wailed, tearing out his hair
Falling on his knees, looked to the sky and said
“Thank God”"

They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line

Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it for others to use it
You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here but you comment below
When the comments below has become common
Motivation to promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment
But you and I know it gets better when mornin' finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the mornin' is when night is dead

Sitting with the poison takes away the pain

678,Hotel CaliforniaEagles,"[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!""

Walking on a dream
How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?

[Pre-Chorus]
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

[Chorus]
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Two people become one
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it

Tell my wife I love her very much

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

If you're a lover, you should know the lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone

Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, is this taboo?

Carafes of blood red wine

And I swear that I'll always paint you

696,Genghis KhanMiike Snow,"[Verse 1]
I know there's no form
And no labels to put on
To this thing we keep
And dip into when we need
And I don't have the right
To ask where you go at night
But the waves hit my head
To think someone's in your bed

[Chorus]
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
I don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me

[Verse 2]
And the lights, they glow
Like I've just lost the World War
And the scene slips away
To the evenness I fake
It's a shit old world
Cause I don't really want you, girl
But you can't be free
Cause I'm selfish, I'm obscene

[Chorus]
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
I don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me

Don't want you to get it on

Whenever the lights go down
That's when she comes alive
Ooh ooh
Maybe it's just something that you can only see in the light
Ooh ooh
A pretty little vixen dancing out on the scene
But the lights are shining, so she's keeping it clean
Don't get too close
Boy, don't touch her skin
Or you'll never feel the same way again

[Chorus 1]
If everything you see is what you're believing
Then she'll be holding your heart
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She likes to do it in the dark
She likes to do it in the dark, oh

[Verse 2]
Whenever the darkness comes, she'll have you right where she wants
Ooh ooh
Just when you think it's all over
It's where it all starts
It sounds like an angel is calling my name
It might be the devil, but they all sound the same
And all her moves won't let you get away
She's gonna make your mind come with you to stay

I will march down an empty street like a ship into the storm
No surrender, no retreat

I will keep you safe and sound when there's no one left to trust
Will you take my hand?

I will fight till the flag waves white until my dying days
Through the bombs and blasts
We will take it back

700,Viva La VidaColdplay,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Put in your hands
The fruit of all my grief
Lying down ain't easy
When everyone needs pleasing

Keeping the water and power on
There ain't no money left
Why can't I catch my breath?
I'm gonna work myself to death

Tides that I tried to swim against

Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing—

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home

A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing—

You try and change me, you can go to hell
Cause I don't want to be nobody else
I like the chip I got in my front teeth
And I got bad tattoos you won't believe

So kick out the jams, kick up the soul

What do you want from me? I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me, I'm not America's sweetheart

So I lit a match and burned it down

My hands are dirty and my heart is cold
The boys I've been with say I got no soul
When I, I meet another honey at the bar
I'll think it's funny when I break his heart, mmm now

I got a mouth to put you in your place

And in time
As one reminds the other of the past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?

A broken house
Another dry month waiting for the rain
And I had been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same

[Hook]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

[Verse 2]
Fragile sound
The world outside just watches as we crawl
Crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time

And so I cry
As I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?

[Hook]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

[Bridge]
Where I used to end was where you start
You were the only one
And now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one

[Verse 3]
Careful hands
And wandering without that much to say
Your words are empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Oh love, is there another way?

[Hook]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

I've made up my mind over and over
Keep pressing rewind but I'm getting older
Tried every door, don't know who I'm looking for
And I've made up my mind over and over

I can't be everything you want me to be
I can't be everything you want me to be
Finally, I can see the light through the leaves
But it's all gone
But it's all gone

What comes from the ground now is returning
It's all the same sound and my ears are burning
In some strange home, don't know who I'm working for
I've made up my mind over and over

I can't be everything you want me to be
I can't be everything you want me to be
Finally, I can see the light through the leaves
But it's all gone

Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody waiting
Getting sick of your surroundings
All you want is some attention

You can tell the truth
You can tell the lie
Say anything you want to say
Are we all just lost in time

Is there reason not to change
Stay the same, become a new thing
Walk backwards, step beyond
Never forget where we come from

You can tell the truth
You can tell the lie
Wonder with what anyone says
We will be alright

And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
And don't fall in love with the moment

An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses

Alone in a world that's so cold?

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said ""How'd you like to waste some time?""
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

[Verse 2]
She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

[Chorus]
Nikki

[Verse 3]
The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her loving will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sure enough, sure enough
Show you how to grind

[Chorus]
Darling Nikki, oh

[Verse 4]
Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you wanna grind

Oh, Nikki, oh
Come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wants to grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

726,The Sound Of SilenceSimon,"[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence."""

It don't take much for the beast to bolt
A split second too late to bring it to a halt
You're hypnotized, your feet follow your shoes
It's kinda like, a cigarette smokin' you

[Chorus]
(Take it from me)
When you start it's just a matter of time
Any minute you will cross that line
(Take it from me)
You never think about the price that you pay
(Take it from me)
It got a mind of its own and it say
(Take it from me)
Its got a mind of its own and it say
(Take it from me)
Its got a mind of its own and it say

[Bridge]
Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you could slow me down?
Knock me off my track
Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you could slow me down?
There ain't no turning back

[Outro]
Take it from me
Its got a mind of its own and it say
Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you could slow me down?
There ain't no turning back
Take it from me

728,AmerikaYoung The Giant,"[Intro]
And so I've arrived
With gold in my eyes
Are you paying attention?

[Chorus 1]
I was searching for something as I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone? As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for

I've been looking for so long in America
Throw my hands in the air...

[Verse 1]
Flash faded
Say you care, but you don't
You know I hate it
It’s a rich kid game, didn't grow up with a throne— it's all it really is

[Chorus 2]
I was searching for something as I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone? As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for

Always talking about one day in America
Same old story, oh: you want glory, son
I've been looking for so long, but you cut me out
Throw my hands in the air 'cause I...

[Verse 2]
Your palace
All the friends you own
So jealous
Felt that rich kid pain, what it is to be alone— it’s all it really is

[Chorus 3]
I was searching for something as I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone? As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for

Always talking about one day in America
Same old story, oh: you want glory, son...

In America, in America

Drenching the soil with blood, baptized in the fire hole

The Devil's spawn no longer breathes
Descending angels and fallen kings
Raise your hands, what do you hold?
The Devil's bleeding crown!

Call upon it's Father, bless the goat, the womanizer
Take him to Astaroth, Inanna's temple of Uruk

They gathered all the children outside the church
And never would they know what went on in there
Close the door and hear all the angels scream
""Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, oh mercy, please!""
Down, down, down
Down below you can hear his hoof digging through the ground
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord
The horned one is back and he wants his crown!

Raise your hands, what do you hold?

730,Ain't No ManThe Avett Brothers,"[Chorus]
There ain't no man-can save me
There ain't no man-can enslave me
Ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in
There ain't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear
Cause I got only love to share
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there

[Verse 1]
You got to serve something, ain't that right?
I know it gets dark, but there's always a light
You don't have to buy in to get into the club
Trade your worries
You gotta show up if you wanna be seen
If it matters to you ma', it matters to me
I'm going to fall hard, yeah I know I am
When the clowns crack up, I laugh with them

There ain't no man-can save me
There ain't no man-can enslave me
Ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in
There ain't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear

[Verse 2]
You say you look funny, I say you're a star
I say you're whatever you think you are
Watch the naysayers fall right in line
If we believe it they'll say, ""she is so pretty; he is so fine.""

[Chorus]
There ain't no man-can save me
There ain't no man-can enslave me
Ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in

If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there

[Verse 3]
You got to go somewhere, ain't that true?
Not a whole lotta time for me or you
Got a whole lotta reasons to be mad; let's not pick one
I live in a room at the top of the stairs
I got my windows wide open and nobody cares
And I got no choice but to get right up when the sun comes through

[Chorus]
Ain't no man-can save me
There ain't no man-can enslave me
There ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in
(That can change the shape my soul is in)
There ain't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear
Cause I got only love to share
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it"

For something they did
To someone they love
Some scream like a baby
Some go out crying
Some bid the world goodbye

Rescuing a nightmare from a dream

Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all her teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans?
Do you want to get up early in the morning?
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

[Verse 2]
Mexico, you are my neighbor
Home of the let's be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago?
Trinidad's got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah, a desparado

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind
Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I'm the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide?

[Outro]
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannonball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen"

749,Asking For ItShinedown,"[Verse 1]
Can I have a moment of your time?
Just a single second so you see that indeed we’ll be leaving you behind Far across that line
Turn it up so you can hear the bells, crashing through the clouds as it rain down the drain
We know all too well, it’s a living hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Careful what you say and who you say and who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say it to

[Chorus]
Maybe you talk too much and you were asking for it, asking for it, asking
You can blame bad luck but you were asking for it, asking for it, asking
When all is said and done, you need to tie your tongue
'Cause when you spit on everyone
You are, you are, you know you're asking for it, asking for it, asking

[Verse 2]
Caught up in the gutter once again
Crashing through the mud, throwing lies, cutting ties 'til the sidewalk ends
And the truth begins
Power through the point of no return
Famously deranged all the same, hope you change if the world is gonna turn
It’s none of my concern

[Pre-Chorus]

Oooh hoo hoo oooh hoo hoo oh

750,WinterbreakMUNA,"[Verse 1]
You say I'd best be going cause it's getting late
And I say
Why don't I walk you home cause it's on the way
But the last time
That we made love, you left in tears
So this time
You're wondering how to leave it here
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that I broke your heart
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know that I took it hard

[Chorus]
Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

[Verse 2]
You pull
That face like, 'here we go again'
So I pull
A flask out the back of my jeans
And then you take a pull
And in my mind we're in my bed
And I'm pulling
Your sweater up over your head
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that you hate how that went
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know what's happening

[Chorus]
Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

[Bridge]
Oh it's magnetic, isn't it?
The sense of something underneath the surface
When you're laying on thin ice
Just a little bit masochistic
A tentative ellipses
The parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
But I think I'm gonna kiss you

[Chorus]
All despite
What we both know

This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try"

It's a, it's a complete farce
Everything you do is a farce!

[Verse 1]
Talking television at the casual party
Here's some brand new friends to get you started off
So start it off
Since Ben got that he's a sociopath
He's only playing games, don't be distracted
It's all or nothing, all or nothing
So you really got something to lose
It's coming around as it did before
Or it's gettin' your attention, but where's the door
I can't locate it, where's it located?
I got plenty to live for

[Chorus]
Blind faith don't sit right
You got rage, wound so tight
I wanna leave, best get out of the way
Blind faith don't sit right
You're full of rage, wound so tight
I'm gonna leave, best get out of the way

[Verse 2]
Awful conversation at the casual party
The jobs, babble on, the recreational hobbies
No, it never stops
Kids and the dog, a freshly mowed lawn
Retirement plans for a mountain home
Been arrested, lived in Texas
My God, I'm gonna leave it with you

[Chorus]
Blind faith don't sit right
You got rage, wound so tight
I'm better leave, best get out of the way
Blind faith don't sit right

Awful television, don't get you started

All your future plans and vacation homes
I wanna go home

Watching through my fingers

Shut my eyes and count to ten
It goes in one ear out the other, oh
One ear out the other, oh
Burning bright right 'til the end
Now you’ll be missing from the photographs
Missing from the photographs

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

In my thoughts you’re far away
And you are whistling a melody
Whistling a melody
Crystallizing clear as day
Oh I can picture you so easily
Picture you so easily

What’s gonna be left of the world if you’re not in it?
What’s gonna be left of the world? Oh

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Caught off guard by your favourite song
Oh I’ll be dancing at a funeral
Dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It’s such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn

[Pre-Chorus]
What’s gonna be left of the world if you’re not in it?
What’s gonna be left of the world, oh

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

If you want to be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle
Now stop worrying and go get dressed

[Bridge]
You might have to excuse me
I’ve lost control of all my senses
And you might have to excuse me
I’ve lost control of all my words
So get drunk, call me a fool
Put me in my place, put me in my place
Pick me up, up off the floor
Put me in my place, put me in my place

[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Cause every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more"
763,Life Can't Get Much BetterGood Charlotte,"[Verse 1]
One promise we made it
We said we’d never break it
Don’t look down be honest
Tell me has it changed
One life that we’re living
We’re somewhere unforgiven
Don’t look down be real now
Tell me has it changed
I just want to see you laugh again

[Chorus]
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay together
These scars are tokens of promises broken
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay forever
We’ve got to hold on we’ve waited so long

[Verse 2]
If I knew we’d end up this way
Do you really think I wouldn’t have tried
If I knew it would break us down
Do you really think I would’ve lied
Now I try to forget the past but it’s all that’s on my mind
I’d give it all if I could get you back
I’d give it all if you were mine
I just want to see you here sometime

[Chorus]
Cause life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay together
These scars are tokens of promises broken
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay forever
We’ve got to hold on we’ve waited so long

[Bridge]
Don’t give up on us, on us
Don’t give up on, on us
Tell me that you meant every word you said
In the text you sent I was going to bed
The girl with the blue eyes
With the blue eyes
It ain’t right it was fuckin’ with me last night

[Chorus]
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay together
These scars are tokens of promises broken
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay forever
We’ve got to hold on we’ve waited so long

Tell me that you meant every word you said
In the text you sent I was going to bed

766,That's All I NeedThe Dirty Heads,"[Verse]
When I was 12, I got baptized
But I've been runnin from Heaven since
Half the time, I wonder, ""Does it even exist?""
I constantly cross the line between pleasure and sin
I try, but sometimes, it seems I just can’t repent
I wonder if my Grandma's lookin down on me with a frown or a grin
Or maybe she's just dirt in the ground, and that’s how it ends
I was so strong in my beliefs as a kid
Now it feels wrong though to believe in this
It's been so long since Jesus made me see He exists
Why can't just send one sign, one time?
Please, just one line- that's all I need
And then I'm confined and reformed
Please, just bend the rules this one time
I need more
I need to know that you are out there listening
I need to know that there is something else
I need to know that there is more then glistening
I need to know that I'm not by myself
That's what the world wants to hear me say
But I know that I'm saved by eternal grace
And the day that I get to the pearly gates
My grandma’s gonna meet me and say my name
The world’s gotten so backwards
Everybody roots for you to fail
And God's the last thing that matters (We’ve got a pulse)
No wonder it's a living Hell! (What's goin on?)
Laying on this operating table- it's impossible to save me
And I’m probably fading into the dark
Hated for the thoughts that I'm saying
I know what confidence waiting
And my haters are praying I don't see tomorrow
Cause they know if I don't make it then I'm not in their way
And their journey to the top would be easier to make
But secretly they wanna peep into the operating procedure
Just to see if there is still a piece of my brain
And they can take it, but wouldn't know what to do with it
They're not creative enough to make the music I did
With the same beats, same bars, same rhymes, same flows
I would kill em all, but the fuckin' ruined the shit
And they're too stubborn to admit that I'm influencing them
Too busy judging me, while I'm making some moves in this bitch
Because I'm careful at who I choose who to include in this crypt
I'd rather be judged by 12, than be carried by 6
So many haters are waiting in the Emergency Room
They wanna see the doctor come out and say I'm not pullin through
Well, I'm pullin through, and the ER is crowded
There's so much noise but no damn talent
I lay down brain dead on the steel table
The top of my head's cut off- it's no fable
My toe tag has got no name label
My cold raps were just dang hateful, woo!
I think it's kinda funny- all these muthafuckas are waiting on me to die
But even if I die, I'm always livin in your mind
My name is Crypt, bitch- I've been dead this whole time
On the inside, when I'm writing my rhymes, bitch, it feels like I can almost fly
But then, I realize no one likes anytime that I spit
But fuck it- I keep it real cause it feels right
When I write down all of my rhymes
No matter what I do, somebody will cry
""You're too offensive, you're non-inclusive""
But it's none of your business how I write my music
Stop trynna change me to fit your vision- I won't do it, I will just refuse it
If you don't like it, then don't fuckin' listen
There's plenty other people out there that do this
No matter what I do, I should've zigged when I zagged
Everybody tells me, I should try something different
But when I do, they tell me that they miss how I rap
It's a catch 22 so, tell me, what's the difference?
If you do what you want, then I won't like it
If I do what I want, then you won't like it
If I do what they want, then no one likes it
The only option is to just stay silent!"

Now it takes four
You don't get me high anymore

Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans

Mannequin fakin' it the best that I can
Cadillac, Cadillac red
No hands on the steering wheel

UFO obliterate the way that I feel

I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

I woke up in the pouring rain
West side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye
Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you really got me now
Black Sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell on to the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside
And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me, then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together

But let me call you when I'm sober

That your boy coulda died right there, no jokin'

New tits for the mistress

Heard you fucked Ryan Philippine at 1 OAK
My man seen you both at the Sunoco
Kissing and touching, lied and said that this was your cousin
Shit, I should have known when you stole money
Bitch called the cop and rolled on me
So good, I got old money
To lay on any motherfucking beach on the planet

This heart, this soul, this house is not for sale

[Chorus]
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

[Bridge]
This house was built on trust
That's what it is, and always was
No wrecking ball could knock it down
This house was built on higher ground

[Chorus]
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

Coming home, I'm coming home

Coming home, I'm coming home

A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss

Oh, who decides from where up high?
I couldn't say ""I need more time""
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
Or one more day inside this life

798,Find MeKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
See you in the Western sky
On the best of nights
Out in the dark
You always seem to come my way
Come and take your shape
Out in the stars
I really wanna know your name
See your face
Know who you are, who you are

[Chorus]
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
I see your shadow knocking at my door

[Verse 2]
Waiting on the smoke to rise from behind your eyes
Take me away
Follow me into the wild
With a twisted smile
I can't escape
And now I got you by my side
All my life
Day after day
Turn to gray

[Chorus]
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
I feel your shadow knocking at my door

[Bridge]
See you in the western sky
Behind your eyes
I can't escape
From the gray

[Chorus]
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
I feel your shadow
What are you looking for

How did ya find me
How did ya find me"
799,OverKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
I see the grass beneath me
I smell the wind and sky
And think to myself
""Don't pass me by""
You dance in strange conditions with strangers of the night
I see you're crazy and so am I
You bled out red and blue
The boys of NYU, they saw you coming from miles away
Nothing is quite as homey
We dive each sunny day
I see you Kenny, you castaway

[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

[Verse 2]
Bright lights, that make the city
Quaaludes on Christmas Eve
And all the good times, we've ever seen
The roles we play together
The slaps across my face
I face the music
You write the scene

[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

[Bridge]
My angel hovers over
The light comes crashing in
I know it’s how this here story ends
I'll hang around forever
Until you cut me down
All pressed and ready to face the crowd

[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore"
800,Open Your EyesDisturbed,"[Verse 1]
You're paralyzed
Breathe your disguise
You feed on the lies that they tell you
Gotta break away
From the numbing pain
Succumb to the rage that's inside you
You're hypnotized
Demoralized
Believe every lie that they sell you
Start channeling
Whatever will remains
Discern from what's fiction and what is true

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?

[Verse 2]
You've lost your sense
From the emptiness
You do as the headlines compel you
Become whole again
And let the war begin
Destroy the veneer that surrounds you
There's no defense
For your recklessness
You stare as the proof lies before you
Why can't you see?
Are you afraid to be
Exposed to the demons around you?

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?
(Oh-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?

[Bridge]
You will all be running
In a world you cannot hide
And the end is coming
For the lemmings standing in line
Overcome it
Let the fury build inside
It can all be broken
If you only open your eyes

[Chorus]
(Woah-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
(Woah-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
(Woah-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?
(Woah-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
(Woah-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
(Woah-oh-oh. Hey!)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?"
801,Eyes On YouKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
Out here looking for the good life
Tongue in my cheek and ya back in my knife
I keep pushing through
My eyes are right on you

Everyone says you should get away
Fast as you can, but I know you'll stay
You never fall behind
He's always on your mind

You're somewhere I wanna go
Nice and swift as we take it slow
Oh, we're on our way
Don't ever hesitate

I'll hide in the dark in the back of your brain
Laughing aloud as we go insane
No time to waste
I never come too late

[Chorus]
If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
Oh, I believe it when I see it
I believe it when I see it

[Verse 2]
You're my misfit and I'm your freak
Dance all night 'til our knees go weak
We can shut this place down
No one else is around

I try hard to understand
The crush of the world in the palm of your hand
You know we sit just right
Let's run away from the light

If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
Well babe, I believe it when I see it
I believe it when I see it

[Verse 3]
Tongue in your cheek and back in my knife
Out here looking for the good life
Keep on pushing through
I got eyes on you
Baby, you know we're on our way
Misfit and freak every single day
Sitting ten feet tall
Let's go and take it all

If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
I know you can see it, I believe it
You can see it, I believe it

We're here for the moment, so let's own it
For the moment, so let's own it
It's here for the taking
Why you waiting?
It's good loving, it's worth making"
802,HallelujahLeonard Cohen,"[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?

It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah"

805,You Want It DarkerLeonard Cohen,"[Verse 1: Leonard Cohen]
If you are the dealer
I'm out of the game
If you are the healer
It means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then
Mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

[Verse 2: Leonard Cohen]
Magnified, sanctified
Be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified
In the human frame
A million candles burning
For the help that never came
You want it darker

[Chorus: Leonard Cohen]
Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my Lord

[Verse 3: Leonard Cohen]
There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

[Verse 4: Leonard Cohen]
They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle-class and tame
I didn't know I had permission
To murder and to maim
You want it darker

[Chorus: Leonard Cohen]
Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my Lord

[Verse 5: Leonard Cohen]
Magnified, sanctified
Be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified
In the human frame
A million candles burning
For the love that never came
You want it darker
We kill the flame

If you are the dealer
Let me out of the game
If you are the healer
I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory
Mine must be the shame
You want it darker

808,I Can't Stop Thinking About YouSting,"[Verse 1]
White page, an empty field of snow
My room is 25 below
This cold man chasing ghosts
A road lies underneath the buried posts
Dogs search the under forest
We scour the empty streets
The fact remains until we find you
Our lives are incomplete

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I hear laughter through a veil of snow and ice?
Where could you be on such a lonely winter's night?

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't care if you exist

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do I hear laughter from behind this veil of midnight?
What are you hiding in the frozen heart of winter?
Somewhere a church bell tolls
I know you're close, the scent's still warm
Then the trail turns cold, cold, cold

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't care if you exist

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Do I hear laughter in the silence of the snow?
I know you're hiding in this frozen heart of winter
The midnight church bell tolls
I know you're close, your scent's still warm
Then the trail turns cold, cold, cold

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't care if you exist

I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you

Du du du du du-du du du

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 1]
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Bridge]
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries"

Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here

816,The Kids Aren't AlrightFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

[Verse 2]
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

[Bridge]
Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend

818,Something From NothingFoo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
Give me the flammable life
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
So here I go
Here lies a city on fire
Singing along, the arsonist choir
Now here I go
It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now, here I go
There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now, here I go, well

[Bridge]
Oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way
But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go, well
Oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
You had no choice you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
You took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

[Chorus]
But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now ain't that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

[Bridge]
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
It goes oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It goes oh, oh, oh
Alright

[Chorus]
No you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now wait that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

I'm something from nothing

822,Cigarette DaydreamsCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
Did you stand there all alone?
Oh I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

[Pre-Chorus]
Do do do do do do

[Chorus 1]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

[Verse 2]
Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
Do do do do do do

[Chorus 2]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do

826,ReflectionsMisterWives,"[Verse 1]
You didn't close the door
Left a crack open, I couldn't ignore
The faint possibility
Of having hope in this insanity
That we still could be
But we're stuck floating in between

[Chorus]
Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you

[Verse 2]
Our eyes were closed with hearts open wide
Dismissed every rule to abide by
Our bodies undressed the layers of shy
Revealing the truth that was buried inside
Filled up of feelings
That now are bursting at the seams

[Chorus]
Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you

[Bridge]
Unsure of what are my dreams, it seems
You've stolen my slumber and awakened another
Life within me that is better than any other
Reaching endless heights in never-ending nights
That can't be seen, put to bed this dream
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you"

What have I become?
What have I done?
I spoke to the devil today
And he swears he's not to blame
And I understood
'Cause I feel the same

There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?

Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No ""Who cares?"", no vacant stare
No time for me

Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?

Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this

To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
To hang from a tree

Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know

Boys, workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat

There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Verse 2]
Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib

And I was burning up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me

When I was kissin' on my baby
And she'd put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamp light, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When, my, time comes around

You are such a rollercoaster
Some killer queen you are
Rollercoaster, I don't say no
Rollercoaster, When you don't say no
And it's such a rollercoaster
Some killer queen you are
So come a little closer

839,GooeyGlass Animals,"[Verse 1]
Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Truth be told
I've been there, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Bridge]
Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice?
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs

840,The Last Goode',"[Verse 1]
If beauty is on the inside
Why do they hand us mirrors?
If perfection is impossible
Then why is weakness feared?

[Chorus]
I wanna be somebody not based on who the world says I should be
'Cause in those eyes, I'm not good enough, good enough
I've heard a million voices, there's only one that I believe
And in those eyes, I am good enough, good enough

[Verse 2]
And I've tried to fit their image
Imagine all the time I waste
Trying to paint this perfect picture of myself
You only see the me that I portray

[Chorus]
I wanna be somebody not based on who the world says I should be
'Cause in those eyes, I'm not good enough, good enough
I've heard a million voices, there's only one that I believe
And in those eyes, I am good enough, good enough

[Bridge]
You can choose not to see, that you're already blessed
You can try all your life, to be better than the rest
You can choose to believe, in a greater love
Someone died, set you free, you are good enough
You are good enough
I wanna be somebody
I wanna be somebody

[Chorus]
I wanna be somebody not based on who the world says I should be
'Cause in those eyes, I'm not good enough, good enough
I've heard a million voices, there's only one that I believe
And in those eyes, I am good enough, good enough
In those eyes, I am good enough
And in those eyes, I am good enough, good enough"
841,Like Real People DoHozier,"[Verse 1]
I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?

[Chorus]
I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

[Verse 2]
I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know

[Chorus]
So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do"
842,Angel Of Small Death And The Codeine SceneHozier,"[Verse 1]
I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths

Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Verse 2]
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene"
843,Same Damn LifeSeether,"[Verse 1]
Come smoke a cigarette and let your hair down
Then pray for the rain to go away
I'm trying to forget I let us both down
Then pray for the sun to come again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never thought I could feel so small
But you're the one that can't live without attention
I never thought I would lose this all
But you're the one who needs the fucking intervention

[Chorus]
Now I'm reliving my whole damn life
And it's a shame that I can't remember
And now I'm living the same damn lie
And it's a shame, but nothing's forever

With every new regret I start to wear down
Then pray for the pain to go away
I need an amulet, I need a new sound
I know everything remains the same

I never thought I could feel so small
I'm the one who will suffer this detention
I never thought I would lose this all
But I accept this is my new education

Now I'm reliving my whole damn life
And it's a shame that I can't remember
And now I'm living the same damn lie
And it's a shame, but nothing's forever

Oh maybe I just wasn't good enough
To blow your mind
You know I tried
Them silver lines, they cut like blades of glass
Not worth the blood we've shed for love

So give it up
Stop beating
Hearts have gone cold
Had enough repeating
It's all been done before

Hearts have gone cold
Hey now
When we gonna wake up

We just keep on digging
Find us something better for the next time
Next time
Something better for the next time/next time

To tow the lines
Make truth the lies
The fortune made now it's all locked away
We lost the key

846,Jackie And WilsonHozier,"[Verse 1]
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

[Verse 2]
She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And lord, she found me just in time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Verse 3]
Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues"

I want to do all the things your lungs do so well

You're the first and last of your kind

Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh, but she burns
Like rum on the fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me

[Chorus]
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

[Chorus 2]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh, but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

God cannot save my soul, it's straight to hell for me, I know

Resolution, no solution

God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?

The spirit's stuck between two roads and waiting there on me
The first path is the way to go, the life I wanna lead
The second road's my crazy past, the darkest parts I try to mask
The drugs, the guns, the lies, the love, the dreams I had of waking up

Resolution, no solution

Nice to meet you, where you been?

Hey, hey

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the good girls bad for a weekend

Or it's gonna go down in flames

If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your... name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the Queen, baby, I'm your King
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
But, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is he? Who is he?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name...

[Bridge]
Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"
858,Jet Pack BluesFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy, the kind that makes June
Feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent

[Pre-Chorus]
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

[Chorus]
And I remember, ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) Did you ever love her? Do you know?
(I remember) Or did you never want to be alone?
(I remember) And she was singing, ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""

[Verse 2]
I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight
And just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our heads were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember, ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""
(I remember) ""Baby, come home""

859,First KissKid Rock,"[Verse 1]
I remember waiting for the school bus
Jenny Clayton was my first crush
And neither one of us had a clue
An old Cheyenne it was my first truck
Rusted, rough and kinda beat up
But when she jumped in it felt brand new

[Pre-Hook]
And now these days when I drive through a small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

Just to love you again

[Verse 2]
I remember drinking from the same cup
We’d break up just to make up
I remember falling in love with you
Smokin’ cigarettes on the tailgate
Man it seems like it was yesterday
When Main Street felt like Park Avenue

[Pre-Hook 2]
And when I’m driving through any ol’ small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those times that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

[Bridge]
When forever felt like it would never come
And we never thought we’d turn 21
So young we thought this could never end
Oh how I wish we could go back again

[Verse 3]
And now that time has taken over
And we can’t fight this getting older
But somehow baby we made it through
And every time I’m a lookin’ at you

[Hook]
’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

[Outro]
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time"
860,NovocaineFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
This is a black, black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch

[Pre-Chorus]
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

[Chorus]
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you

[Verse 2]
I’m just a problem that doesn't want to be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream

[Pre- Chorus]
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

[Chorus]
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you

[Bridge]
Ooooh, I say one day the valley's gonna swallow me whole
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)
I feel like a photo that’s been overexposed
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)

[Chorus]
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you"
861,Twin's Skeleton's (Hotel In NYC)Fall Out Boy,"[Chorus]
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Verse 1]
I just need enough of you to dull the pain
Just to get me through the night 'till we're twins again
'Til we're stripped down to our skeletons again
'Til we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble 'til you find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you, you shrug that

[Chorus]
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
A birth and a death on the same day
And, honey, I only appeared so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck
But I can string enough to show my face in the light again

[Chorus]
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on"
862,Favorite RecordFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
Do you, do-do you remember
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night
And we danced, we danced to Rancid
And we danced, we danced

To you riding shot-gun
Underneath the purple skies
And we danced, we danced
With windows down
And we danced, we danced

864,Something's Gotta GiveAll Time Low,"[Verse 1]
I woke up in a stranger's bed
With pins and needles in my head
And the clock ticking off the wall
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I don't even know myself
I wish I could be someone else
But I don't have a clue at all
Oh yeah

I'm sinking, you're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

Maybe I'm a fucking waste
Filling up the empty space

I want you, thin fingers
I wanted you, thin fingernails
And when you bend backwards
I wanted you, I needed you
Oh-oh, to make me better

I'll love you in springtime
I lost you when summer came
And when you pulled backwards
I wanted to, I needed to

And all I wanted was a shimmer in your shine
To make me bright

Let it all unbreak you to the day you met her

The streets crawl with a deadly omen
Outside I see a world that's broken
I can't breathe, my heart is choking
I need a cure for this life I've chosen

867,Moving OnAsking Alexandria,"[Verse 1]
A boy of anguish, now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road
The years were cruel to him, no he won't let them go
Lays awake tryina find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside
His red eyes tearing up at the man that he'd became
Slowly but surely on the fast track to falling into his grave

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

[Bridge]
I can't believe I've come so far in such short time
And I'm still fighting on my own
If I stop to catch my breath I might never breathe again
So just know this
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I can't believe I let myself break down

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight

869,Cecilia And The SatelliteAndrew McMahon In The Wilderness,"[Verse 1]
I locked myself in a hotel room
Then waited all night for the walls to move
I've loved some girls that I barely knew
I've made some friends, and I've lost some too
Crashed my car, I was seventeen
My mother in the seat riding next to me
The things I've learned from a broken mirror
How a face can change when a heart knows fear

[Pre-Chorus 1]
For all the things my eyes have seen
The best by far is you

[Chorus]
If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry
Don't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Verse 2]
Cafe crawling through Amsterdam
Been around the world with a punk rock band
And I've seen London, and I played Japan
I've been knocked down, I got up again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
For all the places I have been
I'm no place without you

[Chorus]
If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below

870,Every Breaking WaveU2,"[Verse 1]
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
Every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearlessness
Now, I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 2]
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
Every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
It's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Bridge]
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?"
871,What Kind Of ManFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
I was on a heavy tip
Trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side, like always
Wondering what to do with life

[Verse 2]
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
To have me crawling back for more

You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
For twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

""Oh mercy"", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

Off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder
Stopped in cold to read (No time)

[Pre-Chorus]
I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath (no time)
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

Death is from above (No time)

Waste of precious breath (No time)

Everyone, love yourself to death

You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

[Bridge]
Life isn't always what you think it’d be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you?
Somehow, somehow?

[Chorus]
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

874,One Last NightVaults,"[Verse 1]
Tied to a sallow heart
Why does he want to bring me where he goes?
Oh and to find out the reasons why
It's enough to make you wanna try for one last night

[Verse 2]
Ghosts and silhouettes
They take a piece of me, they want it all
Oh but to wait in an empty room
With the feeling that it's closing in

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was dying
But I found nobody there
And if one last night is all that we've been given
Let's live it like we care
For one last night
For one last night

Broken upon the rocks
Let the beating waves come drag me down
Oh but to find out the reasons why
It's enough to make you wanna try for one last night

I had a dream I was dying
But I found nobody there
And if one last night is all that we've been given
Let's live it like we care

In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems

There is whiskey in the water
And there is death upon the vine
There is fear in the eyes of your father
And there is ""yours"" and there is ""mine""

There is a desert veiled in pavement
And there's a city of seven hills
All our debris flows to the ocean
To meet again, I hope it will

How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

[Verse 2]:
There is an answer in a question
And there is hope within despair
And there is beauty in a failure
And there are depths beyond compare

There is a role of a lifetime
And there's a song yet to be sung
And there's a dumpster in the driveway
Of all the plans that came undone

How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

And there is grace within forgiveness
But it's so hard for me to find

How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?"

Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer

Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here

How many days went to waste?

Beacon, burn through it brightly
Soared through a sliver of space

[Verse 1]
You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

[Verse 2]
I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

[Bridge]
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Less you want to move away
From the noise of this place

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me

[Bridge]
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind"
890,Fairly Localtwenty one pilots,"[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I'm evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, what I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat an' repeat yesterday's dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional

[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I'm not evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional, what I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat to avoid yesterday's dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional

[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets (I've seen the streets) you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh"
891,CrystalsOf Monsters And Men,"[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
Lost in skies of powdered gold
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
Showered by the empty hopes
As I tumble down, falling fast to the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

[Verse 2: Nanna]
Making waves in pitch black sand
Feel the salt dance on my hands
Raw and charcoal coloured thighs
Feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin

[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

[Bridge: Nanna]
But I'm okay in see-through skin
I forgive what is within
Because I'm in this house, I'm in this home
All my time

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine"
892,Nothing Without LoveNate Ruess,"[Intro]
I am nothing without love
I’m but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I’m all alone
But I am nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
But she feeling low she feeling sad
I would take credit for what’s wrong
But I am nothing without love

[Verse 1]
Three years at sea after the storm
On this sinking ship that love had put me on
God I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I got nowhere to go

[Verse 2]
Now here you show up with the force of a wave
And so I'm setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state
Hey hey lord, I don’t want to lose this one, she make me feel whole
You know, I am nothing without love

[Bridge]
Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Come on slide up right here by my side
You know that I, I want to rest in your light
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
I wanna rest in your life
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey, na na na ooh oh
Na na na hey

[Verse 3]
I am nothing without love
I’m just these thoughts without a pen
And I would take credit for this song
But I am nothing without love

[Outro]
Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Watch this, come on, come on, come on, come on right by my side
Don't you know that I, don't you know that I
I want to rest in your light
I want to rest in your light
I want to rest in your light
'Cause I am, I am nothing without love"
893,PsychoMuse,"[Verse 1]

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
Black dog drinks from the water trying to cool his tongue
Like the king, finds no peace, his work is never done
Night falls, smoke on the water, darkness closes in
Cold white hand in the deep will drown you for your sins

[Chorus 2: Zac Brown]
It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

Crying out ""Go and wake the king""
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

[Chorus 1: Chris Cornell]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

[Verse 2: Zac Brown]
Mad man, blood on the altar, The Queen will have his head
His ghost will shake those rattling chains long after he's dead
No soul knows his trouble high upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many, he bears that weight alone

[Chorus 2: Chris Cornell]
It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

Crying out ""Go and wake the king""
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, yeah the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

895,BrotherNEEDTOBREATHE,"[Verse 1: NEEDTOBREATHE]
Ramblers in the wilderness we can't find what we need
We get a little restless from the searching
Get a little worn down in between
Like a bull chasing the matador is the man left to his own schemes
Everybody needs someone beside em' shining like a lighthouse from the sea

[Chorus: NEEDTOBREATHE]
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night winds are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home

[Verse 2: Gavin Degraw]
Face down in the desert now there's a cage locked around my heart
I found a way to drop the keys where my failures were
Now my hands can't reach that far
I ain't made for rivalry I could never take the world alone
I know that in my weakness I am strong
But it's your love that brings me home

[Chorus: NEEDTOBREATHE]
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night wheels are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home

[Bridge: Gavin DeGraw]
And when you call
And need me near
Say it where’d you go
Brother, I’m right here
And on those days
When the sky begins to fall
You’re the blood of my blood
We can get through it all

[Chorus: NEEDTOBREATHE]
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I could be the one you call
When you're feeling low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night wheels are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night wheels are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home"
896,My TypeSaint Motel,"[Verse 1]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh ooh
Take a look around the room
Love comes wearing disguises
How to go about and choose?
Break it down by shapes and sizes
I'm a man who's got very specific taste

[Chorus]

So you press play and I'll hit record

Came in like the breeze
I felt it in my knees
Never will it leave
Each day, it is retrieved
Seems like yesterday
Your eyes crept this way
Into my soul, you stared
And brought down every fear

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore, on that day
That it'll never fall apart

We'll never fall apart
With our hands over our hearts

Like water to a seed
Read it in a tale
One too tall to be real
And proved me wrong, it seems
A heart can truly gleam

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore, on that day
That it'll never fall apart
We built our own house, own house

Love that is beating
'Til our lungs stop breathing
Take it all, take it away
We'll still have our riches
No need for stitches

Take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away

You're simpatico
And of all the lift-homes and all the mixed feelings
You're cuts above
And you don't own worries or a chest full of heartache
Yes I know
That I'll never work out exactly how you­'re thinking
But, let me know when I'm needed home

And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give in to you

He used to see her but she sold
Him off on down the river

It's impractical
To go out and catch a death with a dress­ fit for the summer
So you don't
Instead you call me up with a head full­ of filth
Yes I know
That I'll never acquiesce anything you're thinking
But let me know when I'm needed home

And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

Love comes with such a cost

Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight

When you're young you always take what you can get
Even bicycles and sprinklers get you wet
Now I know that there's a different way to die
My body breathes
Heart still beats
But I am not alive

Follow me down to the river
Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight
I'll be down here on my knees
So follow me down to the river
Follow me down through the trees

I'll be down here on my knees

903,Absolution CallingIncubus,"[Verse 1]
It’s like an intuition, or a feeling in the air
An intangible impression that’s always everywhere
You bit into the apple, laid down your sword and shield
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]
I remember feeling the opposite of falling
(Into that spot, where we untie every knot)
Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”

[Verse 2]
It’s an open invitation, come see the sights of sages
We’ve been a pride of lions, so afraid to leave our cages
Don’t fret over the pieces that smolder in the sun
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Cause nothing can be broken when everything is one
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]
I remember feeling the opposite of falling
(Into that spot, where we untie every knot)
Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”
I remember feeling the opposite of falling
(Into that spot, where we untie every knot)
Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”

You bit into the apple, laid down your sword and shield
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field

I remember feeling the opposite of falling
(Into that spot, where we untie every knot)
Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”
I remember feeling the opposite of falling

Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”"

[Verse 1: Mumford & Sons]
Wide eyed, with a heart made full of fright
Your eyes follow like tracers in the night
And the tightrope, that you wander every time
You have been weighed you have been found wanting

[Chorus 1: Mumford & Sons]
Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for

Shelter, you better keep the wolf back from the door
He wanders ever closer every night
And how he waits, baying for blood

Leave behind your wanton ways

Hold my gaze love, you know I want to let it go

Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to look you in the eye

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind

You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government

She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been

[Outro]
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Oh, than I've ever been
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther
Than I've ever been"
908,Angels FallBreaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
I tried to face the fight within
But it's over
I'm ready for the riot to begin
And surrender
I walked the path that led me to the end
Remember
I'm caught beneath, there's nothing left to give
Forever

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

[Verse 2]
Gray skies will chase the light away
No longer
I fought the fight, now only dark remains
Forever
Divided I will stand
And I will let this end

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

[Bridge]
The sun begins to rise
And wash away the sky
The turning of the tide
Don't leave it all behind
And I will never say goodbye

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever"
909,FailureBreaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
Life will come our way, it has only just begun
The world will die alone, the frail will fall below
Time will take our place, we return it back to one
The calm before the cold, the long and lonely road

[Pre-Chorus]
Look for the light that leads me home

[Chorus 1]
Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Failure

[Verse 2]
Drive the cloud away, we will fall from last to none
The dark before the dawn, the world will carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
Look for the light that leads me home

[Chorus 2]
Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Tired of wasted breath, tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Failure

Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down
Tired of wasted breath, tired of nothing left
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down

We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight
Failure, failure
We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight
Failure, failure

Dead inside

[Verse 1: Matt Bellamy]
Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me, babe
Do you have no soul?
It's like it died, long ago

[Chorus]
Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft

[Chorus]
Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

[Bridge]
Feel me now, hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me, stop hiding from me
It's hurting, babe
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything, I can't give you any more
Now I've become just like you

[Outro]
My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside"
913,PeachesIn The Valley Below,"[Verse 1: Angela Mattson, Jeffrey Mendel]
I've been working on my knees, baby; it's alright
Everybody got disease, maybe it's alright
You can steal from me, baby; that's just fine
You can say it's free, baby; that's alright

[Pre-Chorus: Angela Mattson & Jeffrey Mendel]
Working on a feeling, breaking down the ceiling, digging up a deep end
Freezing on the beaches, reaching for the sweetest, sweetest peaches

[Chorus: Angela Mattson & Jeffrey Mendel]
We won't live too long
So let's love for one song
The lion won't lay down
When the holy man's in town

[Verse 2: Jeffrey Mendel, Angela Mattson]
You've been drinking all week, baby; that's alright
You've been stepping on me, baby; it's alright
You've been tearing me apart in the dead of night
I'll be raising my hands when the lightning strikes

[Pre-Chorus: Angela Mattson & Jeffrey Mendel]
Working on a feeling, breaking down the ceiling, digging up a deep end
Freezing on the beaches, reaching for the sweetest, sweetest peaches

[Chorus: Angela Mattson & Jeffrey Mendel]
We won't live too long
So let's love for one song
The lion won't lay down
When the holy man's in town
We won't live too long
So let's love for one song
The lion won't lay down
When the holy man's in town"
914,Ship To WreckFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
Dredging up great white sharks, swimming in the bed
And here comes a killer whale, to sing me to sleep
Thrashing the covers off, has me by its teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

[Verse 2]
What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
And don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
The chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

Good God, under starless skies
We are lost, and into the breach, we got tossed
And the water's coming in fast

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?"
916,Greek TragedyThe Wombats,"[Verse 1]
We're smashing mics in karaoke bars
You're running late with half your make-up on
This method acting might pay our bills
But soon enough there'll be a different role to fill

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I love this feeling, but I hate this part
I wanted this to work so much, I drew up our plans on a chart
Cars are flipping; I'm in hot pursuit
My character's strong, but my head is loose

[Chorus 1]
She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me

[Verse 2]
The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate; there's just no landing pad
And better have said it but, darling, you're the best
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I hate this feeling, but I love this part
She really wants to make it work and I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a water slide as soon as I get home…

[Chorus 2]
Oh, and she hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
It's wrong, but surely worse to leave
She hits like ecstasy

So free up the cheaper seats

917,Miss YouMia Z,"[Intro]
Kurwa, nie wierzę w to, ja pierdolę

[Zwrotka 1]
Obojętnie, ile tysięcy ludzi, dziesiątek tysięcy czy setek mi te oklaski da
Musi to poczuć narcyz sam, że wciąż jest wyjątkowy
Jak perła, którą tylko niektóra z małży ma, ta
Jak jego człowiek Mes na szaleńca to kandydat
Jak każdy z nas nieraz niesnaski sam miewa ze sobą sam
Na głowie ciąży już korona
Nie dotknąłem tej klawiatury dwa miesiące
W dłoni kartę kredytową mam
Ale nie jestem w sklepie, dla siebie sam dzielę ściechę
Mielę kostki na miazgę, tak wjadą o wiele lepiej, o ta
Koko i MDMA nieraz naraz i wtedy jest przyjemniej
Wszystko inne wtedy zupełnie zbędne
Spoko, jak między Rasami, kiedy sprzedali dychę
Dopóki to nie pęka dzień w dzień
Bo wtedy to error jak u Natalii Nykiel
A tak było prawie dwa tygsy, hajsu plikiem
Neurony dobrze usmażone tak jak Kentucky Chicken
Dwadzieścia bitów-fortec siedzi na dysku
Jak bohaterowie Terry'ego Pratchetta
Biała kartko, when did I miss you (kiedy?)
Dreszcze mam, jak patrzę na ścierwo
Kiedyś miałem pół roku przerwy i chyba czas na następną
Narcyzie, jesteś najlepszym, nie udawaj Alzheimera
Tylko poskładaj kurwa cały swój świat do kupy, hashtag Pangea
I gdy to piszę, od miecha clean as a whistle jestem
Przed enterem w notepadzie musiałem wcześniej nacisnąć escape
Spore chmury spowiły w moment moją mikroprzestrzeń
Ale z dużej chmury mały deszcz, z klawiatury znów lecą iskry niezłe
Zajebisty jestem jak nigdy wcześniej
Strach pomyśleć, co będzie
Gdy kalendarz wyjebie mi 3-6 jak kickflip desce
Starsze skillsy jak winko lepsze
Pytasz, czy twoje plecy mam? Obchodzą mnie na nich tylko dreszcze
Narcyza pierwszy raz to spotyka
Sleepin on myself bez objawów narkoleptyka
A wychodzę bez szwanku na bitach
Te święte słowa robią pengę, jakby woziła je pędem do banku lektyka
Więc jak kiedykolwiek sam zwątpisz, raz jeszcze tu w siebie, nie świat
V ma nadzieję, że za chwilę znowu będzie ten track grał
Mówię do siebie, bo kocham się, kiedy leci na kable ta miazga
Tak robię coś, co sam będę banglał, ta

[Refren]
Ten chwilowy hype jest nieistotny
Jak jesteś cool ze sobą, twój vibe jest dożywotni
Nie rumienię się, jak dają propsy
Bo ja i moje ego lecimy na paralotni
Nad ziemię, na niebo
Ktokolwiek się przyjebie do tego
Zawsze tu gram w otwarte karty
Ta! Na mnie pokażcie palcem
Mówcie narcyz, narcyz, narcyz!

[Zwrotka 2]
Wiesz, że jestem szczery
Po tamtej zwrotce zajebałem minimaraton
Lucyfer w piekle posypie mi za to
Ale anioł stróż wziął pieczę
Bo wcale nie paradoksalnie
Minimaraton nic nie zmienił na dłuższą metę
To słychać po tym panczu, kolo
Nie z aureolą, bo po piekle tym kroczę jak Dante solo
Ale nigdy już nie zwątpię tu w siebie sam, kiedy bit będzie banglał
Na monitorach mi, obojętnie, jak będę zorany, ta
Narcyz wrócił na pełnej piździe
Jak widzisz, tej linijki nie skończył na eufemizmie
Ten track to jest mój wake up call
Już serce nie wątpi, to jest braveheart flow
Rezam to wyłącza kurwa na dzielniach prąd
I znowu mówię ""I love myself"" tak jak Kendrick
I kręci się w głowie mi zaraz fioła dostanie błędnik
Ta, jeszcze nie wiesz, jak działa samouwielbienie?
Chodź zobaczyć kurwa z majkiem mnie na scenie, VNM

[Refren x2]
Ten chwilowy hype jest nieistotny
Jak jesteś cool ze sobą, twój vibe jest dożywotni
Nie rumienię się, jak dają propsy
Bo ja i moje ego lecimy na paralotni
Nad ziemię, na niebo

Zawsze tu gram w otwarte karty
Ta! Na mnie pokażcie palcem
Mówcie narcyz, narcyz, narcyz!

Dzień po tym, jak skończyłem to pisać, wstałem o 7 rano i poszedłem po półtora miesięcznej przerwie na siłownię i okazało się, że nie straciłem ani siły, ani kondycji. God damn! Wróciłem na kwadrat i zaraz zaczynam pisać kolejny track, wieczorem idę na G-Eazy'ego, jutro zakładam słuchawki i wypierdalam pisać w parku, bo będzie zajebista pogoda, pojutrze jadę grać festiwal, dzień później zabieram mamę na musical, a jeszcze dzień później oboje rodziców do Portugalii. Do czego zmierzam? Ja pierdolę, jestem kurwa zajebisty! Ahaha!

918,PleaseSawyer Fredericks,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She's calling me, with a gentle touch
A love so real, it was far too much
For a boy like me, a worried mind
To believe in you, I gotta close my eyes

[Chorus]
You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down on my knees

[Verse 2]
The will was strong, but my legs were weak
I could not walk and I could not speak
The love that you gave me was so way down south
Baby I was born just to kiss your mouth
So I became a part of you
And you became a part of me
See I had no choice but to lie to you, see
If I told you the truth, you'd have set me free
You'd have set me free

[Chorus]
You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down onto my knees

I can say please
Baby I can say please
I can say please"
920,The Workingman's HymnJoshua Davis,"[Verse 1]
Some people hunger for the greenback bill
Some folks hunger for the top of the hill
Some people just tryin' to get a decent meal
Well I know that we can turn it around
Some people sleepin' in a fine feather bed
Some folks are dreamin' of an old homestead
Some just need a place to lay their head
Well I know that we can turn it around

[Chorus]
I know that we can turn it around
There's one thing that I've found
If there's a force in the dim singin' a workingman's hymn
I know that we can turn it around

River bottom up to home on high
In the light of the endless sky
Jetsettin' or just gettin' by
I know that we can turn it around

If there's a force in the dim singin' a workingman's hymn
I know that we can turn it around

From the 9th Ward up to Patoka Lake
One man's joy's been another man's pain
But the sun keeps shinin' through the drivin' rain

There's one thing that I've found

921,HallelujahJoshua Davis,"[Verse 1]
Now let’s dive inside the Scriptures
Where we will define God’s Kingdom
It’s His rule and reign and wide dominion from all times beginning
Genesis 1—God the King rules over all
Verse 16, for “rule” the Hebrew word used is mashal ( מֶמְשָׁלהָ related to משל)
See His kingdom order:
Heavenly lights rule day and night, but over birds, beasts, and the fish of water—
God makes man in His image and the distinction, is this:
He hands him dominion and commands him his mission:
To rule over the land and animals mentioned
By expansion, extension, advancing His kingdom
Through his grandsons and kinsmen
The Tree of Life stands for the reward of life God will grant him and give them
See God the Creator King who made all things
Made Adam His vice-king (i.e., vice-regent) and the earth He gave to him (Ps. 115:16)
In His image He made him in to reign like Him:
Meaning to love righteousness and hate all sin!
Hence the other tree to distinguish good from evil
And extinguish anything that looks deceitful
Because as Yahweh separated light from dark—
King Adam was to discern and be wise in heart!
As God finished His work on day 7—He blessed it
Sat down on His Sabbath-Throne, in heaven He rested;
Thus if Adam obeys and endures the test
Then he’ll sit on His Sabbath-Throne of glory rest
And creation will be transformed and blessed
How now is he ruled by sin and the chords of death?
You should put every one of the beasts under your feet
Including the Serpent, who comes in deceit!
You should have bruised and cursed him, and removed the Serpent
But you choose to serve him—now he rules as your king!
And since you forfeited to govern the kingdom
A Son of Adam/Son of Man will recover dominion!

[Chorus 1]
The Kingdom of God is heaven breaking in
Since the Fall to abolish the reign of sin
To advance creation to its greater end
All Praise to the Son of Adam, Son of David King! (2x)

[Verse 2]
Then in the beginning pages, with sin’s brutal entrance
Death, Satan, (and) sin is reigning—now we see there is 2 kingdoms:
God’s saving rule over His covenant people
And Satan’s slavish rule over those governed by evil
Because we see the word mashal ( משל ) “to rule” again
In Genesis 4 with Cain, but now sin is ruling him! (Gen. 4:7)
Yet see this crucial thing:
Chapter 17 God promises through Abraham will come those who are kings! (Gen. 17:6, 16)
So it’s clear through Abraham’s family tree
God will bring about His saving reign for humanity
On 2 passages we have to gaze, about a Son of Adam’s reign
That will happen in the latter days ( בְּאַחֲרִ֥ית הַיָּמִֽים):
First, Jacob says the scepter won’t depart from Judah
So this specific tribe is set apart as Ruler (Chapter 49! [v. 10])
Then Balaam in Numbers 24 said:
A Scepter from Israel will crush the enemy’s forehead! (Numb. 24:17)
He will suffer then be glorified it’s foreshadowed by Joseph
Working mighty acts of judgment, patterned by the staff of Moses
Kingdom precious laws expressed in the Decalogue (Ex. 20)
Blessings fall, if they’re kept, lest you get His Scepter-Rod (Deut. 28)
In the book of Deuteronomy in chapter 17
The LORD gives His standard for the man that He will bless as king:
He’ll keep the Law on his heart, the Torah He will guard
He won’t be haughty like Saul, He’ll be in awe of his God! (Deut. 17:14-20)
Joshua’s a ruler-figure!
Leading a kingdom of priests, carrying God’s throne on dry ground through the River (Josh. 3-5)
To drive out the brood of sinners
From the Land God promised them
So Joshua’s slaughtering! (Josh. 6, 10-12)
Idolaters, they conquered them
Because these Gentile kingdoms are the embodiment of the demonic kin
Bringing the Ark of the Covenant (Josh. 3:3-17; 6:4-21)
And this is symbolizing that the Kingdom of God is judging them (INTRUSION!)
These counterfeit kingdoms, now have an ending
Surrounded by the thousands of rowdy shouts that’s against them. (Josh. 6:16-21)
Because His judgment reserved for the end of time
INTRUDES into History by His set design (INTRUSION!)
Now we should discuss this:
Israel needs a wise human king, that’s the point of the Book of Judges (Judges 1:1-2; 18:1)
Because without a king who’s discerning good from evil
To idols they turn as perverted, crooked people (Judges 17:5-6; 21:25)
So David is God’s choice as king (1 Sam. 16:1)
Anointed twice—privately then publicly
To his Greater Son this points to Him (1 Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 5:1-3)
Psalm 8—he sees himself as a second Adam
With the Majestic One David’s impressed when asking:
“who is man that You’re mindful of him
Or the Son of Adam ( וּבֶן־אָ֜דָ֗ם ) that You assign as a king?!?”
Verse 6 in the English—
Mashal ( משל ) is used, he says “you caused him to rule” ( תַּמְשִׁילֵהוּ)
Because he’s given dominion
Thus the Judah-Ruler is him (Gen. 49:10; Judges 1:1-2)
Only David could dispossess and remove Jebusites from Jerusalem (Josh. 15:63; Judges 1:21; 2 Sam
5:6-10)
It’s the Kingdom-City (Zion!)
If the kingdoms are submitting
David gives them pity or they’re smitten really quickly! (Ps. 2:10-12)
Though Solomon had a kingdom of peace
He’s subdued by the dominion of sin and they slippery beast (Satan!)
He couldn’t line up to his own kingly wisdom
In Proverbs, because sin’s throne is within men!
Though Solomon’s kingdom and fame extends
He and his sons couldn’t put an end to the reign of sin
They’re exiled, David’s royal line’s dethroned (2 Chr. 36:11-21)
But God’s Faithfulness will in time be shown!
Because Yahweh’s Covenant Love won’t be severed (Ps. 89:24-34)
He promised David’s Son must sit on his throne forever (Ps. 132:11)
Psalm 89—God will not lie to David! (Ps. 89:35-37)
He’ll send the Lion of Judah, to die and then raise Him!!! (Rev. 5:5-6)

[Chorus 1]
The Kingdom of God is heaven breaking in
Since the Fall to abolish the reign of sin
To advance creation to its greater end
All Praise to the Son of Adam, Son of David King! (2x)

[Verse 3]
The Kingdom of God is an Old Testament Concept
Which was promised of old and stressed by the Prophets (Daniel 2:31-35; 44-45; Obadiah 21)
The end-time Kingdom would bring in the Day of the LORD
To save His people, and His foes get slain with the Sword! (Zeph. 1:7-2:3)
And there’s 2 Ages:
This Age, and the Age to Come—but the Age to Come has 2 phases
And the first phase has begun; (1 Cor. 10:11)
Because the heavenly-order is the Kingdom proclaimed by the Son! (Mark 1:14-15)
The Kingdom of Heaven is already breaking through
To end the rule of death and Satan enslaving you
Because whether through (love of) jewelry or pearls
Or the beauty of a girl
Satan reigns as “the ruler of this world” (John 12:31; 14:30; Eph. 2:2; 6:12)
So in the Gospel of Mark
The ministry of the Son of God has its start with this awesome remark:
“The time is fulfilled—His Kingdom is at hand” (Mark 1:14-15)
Because in the wilderness He overthrew the king over man (Luke 10:17-19)
Thus the Kingdom arrived, because the King had arrived
And its Inauguration was evidenced by its signs! (Matt. 4:23)
Think it’s only future? You’re wrong dude:
Demons cast out by the Spirit proves His Kingdom has come upon you! (Matt. 12:22-29)
Bringing Heaven’s Assault to subject the revolt of Satan that affected us all and rescue our souls
It’s Satanic dethronement by Ransom’s Atonement (John 12:30-32; Col. 2:15)
Hence the “strong man” (ἰσχυρός) is bound by a “Stronger” Man (ὁ ἰσχυρότερός) now! (Mark 1:7; 3:27)
I have got a lot to say about the βασιλεία
It’s about the Will of the Father, hence His Awesome Prayer! (Matt. 6:10)
But His Kingdom far surpasses expectations
To just rescue from Rome’s oppressive nation
(It’s) more than Restoration and reclamation
Of what king-Adam lost to sin, death, and Satan;
But rather this Last Adam advances this wrecked creation
Unto its heavenly destination!
Through Him all His brethren risen
Solomonic Splendid Wisdom (Matt. 12:42)
He received all honor from the Father at Ascension, given (Philip. 2:9-11; Eph. 1:20-21)
Resurrected to extend dominion through His blessed kinsman (Eph. 1:22)
(He) poured His Spirit out upon them, now we spread His Temple Kingdom! (Acts 2:33; 1:8)
The Resurrected Lord—indeed!
In Matthew 28 says “all authority” is restored to Me (Matt. 28:18-20)
So Jesus Reigns NOW (Rev. 12:10-12)
But you say, “HOW?”
His kingdom spreads through His suffering-Church and great trials (Rev. 1:9)
His reign’s expressed through the Church; the gates of hell can’t prevail (Matt. 16:18)
Because the power of His Resurrection exerts (Eph. 1:19-20)
Soon we’ll rest from our works (Heb. 4:8-10)
And sit with Him on His Sabbath-Glory Throne when He brings heaven to earth (Rev. 3:21)
This Psalm 72 King will save the poor (Ps. 72:2-4, 12-14; James 2:5)
With grace galore, David’s Son is really David’s “Lord” ( אֲדניִֹ Adonai)! (Ps. 110:1; Matt. 22:41-46)
But whose ever heard of an All-Compassionate Potentate
Who calls His Royal Children to cry out at His Throne of Grace
Now to the Christian living in enslavement to porn
Know that over you sin doesn’t reign anymore
Because through your Union with Christ, you’re raised with the Lord
There’s been a breach with sin—a deep change at the core!
Deep within your inner being
The Spirit of the King is seated
(plus) Jesus is your Priest-King who’s continually interceding
No longer slaves to sinning, by faith we’re in Him
Transferred from Satan’s reign to His New Creation Kingdom (Col. 1:13-14)
BUT NOT YET in the full bliss of its Wholeness (Rev. 11:15)
“Come, Lord Jesus!” Bring the Kingdom in its Fullness! (1 Cor. 15:24-26)
We await the full bliss of its Wholeness (Rev. 21:10, 22:1-5)
“Come, Lord Jesus!” Bring the Kingdom in its Fullness! (Hallelujah)

[Chorus 2]
The Kingdom of God is His Saving Rule
Through King Jesus whose reign is true
Sin, death, and Satan, He’ll straight subdue
Right Now—all things are being made His stool (1 Cor. 15:24-26; Ps. 110) 2x

[Chorus 1]
The Kingdom of God is heaven breaking in
Since the Fall to abolish the reign of sin
To advance creation to its greater end
All Praise to the Son of Adam, Son of David King! (2x)"

Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

[Verse 2]
I was drunk and it didn’t mean a thing
Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it ohhhhh)

[Bridge]
No one wants you when you have no heart and
I’m sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You’ll never know if you don’t ever try again
So let’s try
Let’s try
Let’s try


[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)

Drifting through the halls with the sunrise

Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine

'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine

And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning round
Never knew I was a dancer
'Til Delilah showed me how

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around

Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine

A different kind of danger in the daylight

Took anything to cut you, I can find

A different kind of a danger in the daylight

Now it's one more boy and it's one more line

Taking the pills just to pass the time

[Verse 1]
You hold it, in your hands
And let it flow, this cruelty
Of youth as you fall again
Alone, In the compromise of truth

[Chorus]
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight, why do you leave it open?

[Verse 2]
And the stakes remain too high
For this silent mind
And the shake, the lonely itch
That courses down my spine
To leave a love divine
Don’t leave a love divine
Its a water tight excuse

[Chorus]
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight, why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell you will always be danger

How does the earth around your feet
Just slip away?
And the bandit that greets you in the night
With snake eyes, the most precious kind

We had it tonight! Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes!

926,Lane Boytwenty one pilots,"[Chorus]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain an' darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless, honest
There's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want an' what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows

[Chorus]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love an' me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless

[Chorus]
They say, ""Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway

When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane

Right time wrong place
As I pled my case

But the fourth one's out
I can tell cause it's a bit darker
Than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought
Of light bulbs in this house
So I head out
Down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions
And I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections
And I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out
And now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking
'Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house.'

Cheated and lied, broken so bad
You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair
They're all the same, who can compare?
First you lose trust, then you get worried
Night after night, bar after club
Dropping like flies, who woke you up?
On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on
It's not your house, where'd you go wrong?
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt

Turn it around, get a re-write

Maybe I could swim into your thoughts like your drugs do
Paralyze your body, sick and tired of waking up to
Burning eyes and cigarettes
I’m falling through the couch like a suicide mission tonight
My God, here comes the downside
Wild eyes of terror pray for sex on the beach
While oceans of kerosene will soak into me
I'm not meant for this world, I just don't see the point
Don’t think about it, don’t over think about it
And life is a joke, but everything’s riding on me tonight
Been counting the stars and scars
How I’m becoming a work of art

Desperate times and desperate measures
I come so close, my hopes are severed by the downside
A million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile

The whispered words “You’d better hide the bullets”
You stayed on the phone and talked to me day and night
Trigger my nightmare once again
It’s fucking loaded in hand
And we’ll let the fire rage
The smoke and the drowning flames
My bedroom computer light is the only menace to my new faux wooden blinds

Desperate times and desperate measures
I come so close, my hopes are severed by the downside
A million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile

I’ll be surrounded by all of the ones I've loved and cared about
And then burn it down

Counting the stars and scars

Maybe I’m crazy, maybe I’m weak

I'm a whisper lost upon wind
I'm the ember that will burn you down
I'm the water that will drown you
I'm a star that's just a black hole now
I'm a terrifying danger
I'm a fruit decaying on the ground
I'm a swallower of anger
I'm the tree that falls that makes no sound
I make no sound

Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

I am fungus in the forest
I'm a lizard with a poisoned tongue
I'm the child in the manger
I'm the one who sacrificed his son
Rust is showing on my armor
I am wheezing like an old man done
I'm a product of my anger
I'm the bullet in a loaded gun

Black ocean, cold and dark
I am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
But the only girl that could talk to him just couldn't swim
Tell me what's worse than this
And it echoes in the halls
They danced along the walls
The memories of your ghost
You are the one that I used to love
And I'm still in love, but I've never loved you the most

[Chorus 1]
I've seen better days
So unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe

You gave me everything you had
Every little thing you had
A pure love unrehearsed
I've seen your best and worst
And at your worst, you're still the best
But at my best, I am the worst
It's a curse
Your eyes are lined in pain
Black tears don't hide in rain
And I tied you to the tracks
When I turned around, I heard the sound
I hit the ground, I know there's no turning back

I've seen better days
So unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe the truth
Better days, so unafraid in my youth

I am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
But the only girl that could talk to him, she couldn't swim

The ice, it numbs my throat if only for the night
My muscles will contract, your bones will crack
It's just a fact 'cause I am here to win this fight

I can't fucking breathe, much less believe the truth
I pick up a gun, aim for the sun, and shoot
Better days, so unafraid in my youth

A little sleep, a little slumber
A little folding of the hands

He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation I cannot forget

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Verse 2]
As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one

In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become

You'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die

You'll die

For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die
You'll know why

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah

All my no's just turned to yes
Silently I must confess
My troubled history
That's washed away all my sins

Down is not where I belong
This aching heart won't turn to stone

951,GravityPapa Roach,"[Verse 1: Jacoby Shaddix]
I was there on the day truth died
Blood on my hands throw 'em up in the sky
I was the number one sinner, no less
My life was a lie, and my wish was a death
I fell in love with the ways of the world
Money, the fame, the booze, the girls
But I couldn't stay faithful, if I tried
I turned in to a devil, you could see it in my eyes
I blacked out, told everything I ever did
I couldn't take all the lies I was living with
I broke your heart, woke up the next day
My bags outside, yelling, ""Get the hell away!
You're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
And you can't never change all the things that you did!""
That's when I knew it, it wouldn't last
You never get away, when you're running from the past

[Chorus: Maria Brink/Jacoby Shaddix]
I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

[Verse 2: Jacoby Shaddix]
I'm a broken man, I'm full of sin
I'm sick of all this hell that I'm living in
And I can't escape it, this is how it feels
When you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
You tore me down, wished that I was dead
Said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
But when I push away, you only pull me closer
It's only over when we both wanna say it's over
I gotta change this is not who I am
I wanna start over wanna try this again
You're everything I need, everything I'm not
So pull the trigger, give me one more shot

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

You love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
You lifted me up just to watch as you broke me
You promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
No matter what you say, I don't know truth from the lies
I helped you up, like I always do
I forgave you for your sins and I carried you through them
No matter how hard we fought, we always knew
You will bleed for me, and I will bleed for you

Fly into outer space

953,Never Ending CirclesCHVRCHES,"[Verse 1]
Throw me
No more bones and I will tell you no lies
This time
At least I am not
So cold
You give me everything I never deserved
This time
You know I'll leave

[Chorus]
Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to another no man
If you want another, say you need another

[Verse 2]
Cut off
I'll go my way if I'm going at all
This time
Believe that the strong
Red lines
That I will draw will come and cover you up
This time
You know I'll leave

[Chorus]
Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to another no man
If you want another, say you need another

[Bridge]
We are losing ground
It's time to save your neck
And I will try to find my feet and go
I am braced for words that never come
But I choose to decide that
I don't regret it, I don't regret it

[Chorus]
Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to another no man
If you want another, say you need another"
954,Blame It On MeGeorge Ezra,"[Verse 1]
The garden was blessed by the Gods of me and you
We headed west for to find ourselves some truth, ooh
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
We counted all our reasons, excuses that we made
We found ourselves some treasure, and threw it all away
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?

[Chorus]
When I dance alone, and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?

[Verse 2]
Caught in the tide of blossom, caught in the carnival
Your confidence forgotten, and I see the gypsies roll
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?

[Chorus]
When I dance alone, and the sun's beating down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?

[Bridge]
When I dance alone, and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
When I dance alone, I know I'll go
Blame it on me ooh
When I'll lose control, I know I'll go
Blame it on me ooh

What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?"
956,Let It HappenTame Impala,"[Verse 1]
It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
""Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen""

[Chorus 1]
All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

[Chorus 2]
All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my ticker fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry

[Bridge]
I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to bounce to it
All the while thinking I might as well do it
They be lovin' someone and I’m not that stupid
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it? And you wanna think that

[Outro]
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along"
957,KillpopSlipknot,"[Verse 1]
She's sticking needles in her skin, I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy
But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing, the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see
Will she ever find one million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely, but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world, no one hurts this pretty girl but her

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, she's beautiful, a little better than a man deserves
You are not insane, please tell me she won't change

[Chorus]
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me), oh

[Verse 2]
She's drowning in herself again, my God, what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do but have my way
She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers, it doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head, something tells me I'm the one who's kept

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, so volatile, a little better than a man defiled
Ooh, I need the pain, please tell me she won't change

[Chorus]
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me), oh

[Outro]
We were meant to be together
Now, die and fucking love me
We were meant to hurt each other
Now, die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me"
958,True FriendsBring Me The Horizon,"[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front

[Verse 1]
It's funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start
But I couldn't even see the forest for the trees

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid you asked for this
You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

[Verse 2]
It's kind of sad, 'cause what we had, well, it coulda been somethin'
I guess it wasn't meant to be
So how dare you, try and steal my flame just 'cause yours faded
Well, hate is gasoline, a fire fueling all my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid you asked for this
You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

[Bridge]
You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline
You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline

[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

[Outro]
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front"
959,Wasn't Expecting ThatJamie Lawson,"[Verse 1]
It was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that
Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could have missed
I wasn't expecting that
Did I mis-read the sign
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that
You spent the night in my bed
You woke up and you said
""I wasn't expecting that""

[Chorus]
I thought love wasn't meant to last
I thought you were just passing through
If i ever get the nerve to ask
What did i get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that

[Verse 2]
It was only a word
It was almost mis-heard
I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't expecting that

[Chorus]
I thought love wasn't meant to last
Honey, I thought you were just passing through
If i ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that

[Bridge]
Oh isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed

[Verse 3]
If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
I wasn't expecting that
When the nurses they came
Said ""it's come back again""
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by surprise
I wasn't expecting that"
960,Follow YouBring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
My head is hauntin' me and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel somethin', 'cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side
Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I'm your one-man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm tellin' you, you're all I need
I promise you, you're all I see
'Cause I'm tellin' you, you're all I need
I'll never leave

[Chorus]
So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you

[Verse 2]
Come sink into me and let me breathe you in
I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen
So dig two graves, 'cause when you die
I swear I'll be leaving by your side

[Chorus]
So you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you so you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you
I will follow you, I will follow you

[Intrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
So you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you"
962,OutsideFoo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
There you are dancing at your altar
Beautiful earthling, dressed in kashmir
All of your sound echoes through the canyons
Down below they're dreaming
Hear the sirens screaming
Another time, another world
Girls were boys and boys were girls
Find the glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move
Everybody needs some room
There's something out there

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside — of me

[Verse 2]
Oh, I found the space between the spaces
Standing in the nothing, and time reclaims you
And as the wind will beat you down
And the wind the only sound
There's something out there

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside — of me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside — of me"
963,Song For SomeoneU2,"[Verse 1]
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

[Chorus 1]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

[Verse 2]
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there it's yours to take

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

[Chorus 2]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, this is a song for someone

[Outro]
And I'm a long long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out"
964,Circlesmachineheart,"[Verse 1]
If you're looking for a diamond
You gotta sift through the gold
If you're searching for a way out
You gotta take the new road
If you don't keep the motion moving
It can all feel the same
In the heart of the city
Where the streets are the veins

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, when I'm runnin' low
Oh, when the river's dry
Oh, can you help me go on?

[Chorus]
One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna, run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time, pull me in a circle, circle
Circle, pull me in a circle, circle, circle

[Verse 2]
Oh, I know this is heavy
Like a weight on your back
But I think that we can carry
Carry on to the last
And we're laughing and crying oceans
At the smallest of things
But I feel so much better
When we find the release

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, like a broken light
Oh, in the blackest night
Oh, can you flip the switch on?

[Chorus]
One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna, run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time, pull me in a circle, circle
Circle, pull me in a circle, circle, circle

[Bridge]
I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
And it's never in the knowing
It's in the not giving in
And when the earth is slippin', trippin'
But underneath that fear
Remember we're not finished
We're not finished

[Chorus]
One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna, run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time, pull me in a circle, circle
Circle, pull me in a circle, circle, circle

[Chorus]
One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna, run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time, pull me in a circle, circle

965,The OthersideRed Sun Rising,"[Verse 1]
I know I'm not as hot as the flame that burned here before me
I've been flipping through all your moments and tearing out memories

[Pre-Chorus]
How long how long can you carry this note
How low, how low can we keep digging this hole
Until we come out on the other side

[Chorus]
Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone

[Verse 2]
Trying to wash all of my sins clean
I've gotten too filthy
The drain is full but still circles beneath me
Like a fool to sanity

How long how long can you carry this note
How low, how low can we keep digging this hole
Until we come out on the other side

[Chorus]
Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone

Will you come out alone
Will you come out at all
Will you come out alone
Yeah, yeah

Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side
The other side
The other side
On the other side
The other side
Where you come out alone"
966,Dug My HeartBORNS,"[Verse 1]
You dug my heart a grave
I watched you illustrate the expression of another lonely girl
And there you lie awake
And wish you knew a way to fade the blaring silence from your only world

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you're running to the sound of the light
Running to the sound of the light
Running to the sound of the light

[Chorus]
Ooh, oh
It's inevitable, ain't it?
You left without sayin'
Ooh, oh
I hope the cracks in the pavement, lead back to you, baby
Back to you, baby

Just to make room for any
Thoughts of caressin' your sweet
Anatomy as we sleep
The taste you left on my teeth
Your breath across my left cheek
The feelin' chemically, oh

Now you're running to the sound of the light
Running to the sound of the light

She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
Will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

Lips generous and warm
You build me up like stairs
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its weight
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out

I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be

Won't you let it be
I never should have told you

968,MoleculesAtlas Genius,"[Verse 1]
We steal the molecules from the dead
We liberate inanimate objects
Is this a path of will up ahead?
Or are we just destined to get what we get?

[Pre-Chorus]
Drawn to your face like never before
Even the mistakes aren't really mistakes at all

[Chorus]
I wanna confess that you own me
And we don't rest if we're lonely
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive

We steal the molecules from the dead
We liberate inanimate objects
Is this a sign of will in our heads?
Or are we predestined to get what we get?

I wanna confess that you own me (that you own me)
And we don't rest if we're lonely (if we're lonely)
There's innocence in the moment

We've been kings and homeless
Still, we're just fragments of a great collide

There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive

I wanna confess that you own me (that you own me)

970,DemonsImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"
972,Sweater WeatherThe Neighbourhood,"[Verse 1]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about

Dancin' around big eyes as well

We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

[Verse 2]
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
We're on each other's team

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?

For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls

I see fire

Hear the sirens, hear the sirens

[Verse 1]
Hear the sirens, hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bed
Just to know we’re safe, I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear

[Chorus 1]
Oh, had to take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn’t care, before you were here
I danced in laughter, with the ever after
But all things change, let this remain

[Verse 2]
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?
For every choice, mistake I made it's not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I’ll wait, I’ll understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, it’s a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much, I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace, by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out

Looking for the time of your life (no one's gonna find out)

A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (in your nightgown)

All my friends always lie to me, I know they're thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)

[Verse 2]
Keep on dreaming, don't stop breathing, fight those demons
Sell your soul, not your whole self
Oh, if they see it when you're sleeping, make them leave it
And I can't even see if there's hope there, anymore
So

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)

[Bridge]
Being me can only mean feeling scared to breathe
If you leave me, then I'll be afraid of everything
That makes me anxious, gives me patience
Calms me down, lets me face this, let me sleep
And when I wake up, let me be

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me

Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth

Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me

That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors

Never took your side, never cursed your name
I keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-o-oh
And we've come as far as we’re ever gonna get
Until you realise, that you should go-o-o-oh

Will never keep your proud head from falling

And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

In the dying light, I’m the only one here
And I will cover you, until you go-o-o-oh

1000,Dirty PawsOf Monsters And Men,"[Verse 1]
Jumping up and down the floor
My head, is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn

The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

[Verse 2]
Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees

The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

[Refrain]
La la la
La la la, la
La la la
La la la, la

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
So for a while, things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines

But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws

Long before the world I know
Tore it all apart
Once upon a time
There was apart of me I shared
Years before they took away
The part of me that cared

I've been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm going
But I know just where I've been
I've flown a million miles
And I rode so many more
Everyday a castaway
A vagabond battle born
A battle born

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time
I had an open point of view
But that was just so long ago
Before I had a clue
Was there such a time
Where I didn't stand alone
Was there ever a time
And how would I of known

Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing

[Chorus]
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love, it's very late
'Til morning comes
Let's tessellate…

[Break]
Go alone, my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones, alone, my lover
And keep us on my heart

[Verse 2]
Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning
They'll nosh you up, yes, they'll nosh the love away
But it's fair to say, you will still haunt me

[Chorus]
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love, it's very late
'Til morning comes

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well

How long of time is left for you

I've had the deepest rivers

All my friends, they’re different people
Anxious like the ocean in a storm
When we go out, yeah, we’re electric
Coursing through our bodies ’til we’re one

And why mess up a good thing, baby?
It’s a risk to even fall in love
So, when you give that look to me
I better look back carefully
‘Cause this is trouble, yeah this is trouble

All my friends, stay up past midnight
Looking for the thing to fill the void
I don’t go out much like I used to
Something ’bout the strangers and the noise

I never said you’d be easy
But if it was all up to me
I’d be no trouble, hey, we’re in trouble

Confuse what I feel with something that's real

And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

Incapable of makin' alright decisions

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, ""You got me, baby
Are you mine?""
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)

I'm alive in here, so alive in here, pulling down a little peace
I'm open wide in here, slow to rise in here, saving grace and killing me
You say this only makes me incomplete
I'm canceled out and rendered obsolete
Tell the mad chameleon he's not welcome anymore
I know what I'm looking for

Somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know, I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me, I'm just too young to care

I can see in here and I can feel in here
Comatose with common sense
I take my time in here, somebody get me out of here
What am I so against?
I just want to watch the whole world burn
Lost a million times and I won't learn
Show me someone innocent, I'll show you there’s no proof
I may become, but I'm no fool

I'm not close, I'm not safe
I don't know, don’t know, am I better off in chains?

Wanna fall, fall so far

After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic?
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Yes, I do

Of course I do"
1038,Best FriendFoster The People,"[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 1]
Feelings sleeping in the field again
But I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
Well, I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc

[Pre Chorus 1]
It dries up
I've been a spoken word, I've been a river bed, I've been a rabid force
And let it flow out from within
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh!

[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 2]
Waves in theta slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel the celestial beings
Wilted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see, I can see the beauty in the mess

[Pre Chorus 2]
It dries up
I've been a river bed, I tried to salt the wound
I've carried more than I can
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Sometimes it feel like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh!

[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside down)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Bridge]
I am here
No matter where you are
I'm waiting here with open arms
No matter where you are
Sometimes you have to wait until it passes by
Like a satellite or star
No matter where you are

[Refrain]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You know it, ooh, ooh
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Oh yeah, you know it
Ooh, ooh

Oh yeah, you know it
You oughta know that I'm here no matter where you go

Oh yeah, you know it
That's how you know that your best friend's all strung out"

Hey you!
Remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, you took it all
You tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me
It isn't fair, to have your way
To try and get up and go
And na-na-na-na now, can't you see
It isn't fair, to have your way?
But I'm trying to get your attention
I need you to know that

1040,Guilty All The SameLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way
But oh, we all know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Show us all again, that our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need
Show us all again 'cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way
And oh, you will know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 3: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock
Till pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game, to me you're all the same
You're guilty

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same"

Don't get me started, love
I've had too much to drink
Had too much time to think
So leave me alone
Crying when you're by yourself
'Cause of what they think about you
Makes time go slow, slow, slow, yeah
Makes time go slow, slow, slow, slow

[Verse 2]
Something's gotta give soon
Or I'm gonna lose it
Substance abusing
And never come down, down
Fall off the deep end
And forget my English
What's the point of language
If you don't say what you feel?
So, with that being said

To all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
Oh yeah, I hate you too
To all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit

Doses and Mimosas
Champagne and cocaine
Help to get me through

[Verse 3]
Ten in the morning
And I'm skipping breakfast
And drinking a beverage (Ahh)
To ignore it all
Guess ignorance is bliss and
I've come to embrace it
It's all overrated
Except drugs and alcohol
So, with that being said

To all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
Oh yeah, I hate you too

The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again

I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

[Verse 2]
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees

Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

[Chorus]
'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

[Bridge]
Are we tough enough
For ordinary love

[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love"
1043,I Wanna Get BetterBleachers,"[Verse 1]
Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television, and put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past 'cause
I froze in time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better

[Verse 2]
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind because the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

[Verse 3]
I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til i wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if it's gonna kill me

[Verse 4]
Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better"

Well, I gave her what I got but couldn't handle her broken heart

The right words in the hands of dissidents with the fire

But even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah

With all these things I wait for revelation
These things make me want to duck for cover

The war machine will put out both its hands for a dollar
It's drinking at the table with the chrome hand guerrillas
And the young one dripping make-up lift her leg up to holla

The right things in the hands of dissidents with the fire

Faded and worn at the seams
A psychotropic wanderlust sick and laughing
Their words bared their teeth into the wall
I promised I would rid the world of feral animals

I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd off yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword?
Well, you'll fade out anyway

[Chorus]
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

Fill the air with what you like
Another weekend massacre of opinion
Don't be afraid of the knife
Sometimes you have to cut the limb to survive

I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd off yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword?
Well, you'll bleed out anyway

Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?

You got to get back up and face your demons

Death surrounds
My heartbeat’s slowing down
I won’t take this world’s abuse

This is how it feels when your dignity’s stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

Break their hold
Because I won’t be controlled

What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

Here I sit all alone like an airplane
On the edge of a sky full of solid gray
Staring at the ceiling
Tell me that I’m dreaming

All the words that I always wish you would’ve said
All these dreams that we had now fade to black

'Cause I don't have a reason and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
But we both keep on waiting, for what we left behind

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away

Hide my face again, harbor in the shadows
Feel this weight of sin hammering away
Die with the guilt of a thousand AWOL soldiers
Die, watch the scythe usher me astray

The ugly side of me is strong
Take aim, a loaded gun, pull back on all who run
A coward’s truth inside the wrong

This means war
This means war
This means war

Lash your tongue of bane, carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust, battle never ends
Lie, mask the pain of a child who’s forsaken

No one to miss me when I’m gone
With no more words to say, no argument to stay
Another post I don’t belong

No promise for today
No one to hear the call
No tattered flag to raise

Walk the razor’s edge cut into the madness
Question all you trust buy into the fear
I see the man ripping at my soul now
I, I know the man, I know him all too well
There’s nothing here for free, lost who I want to be
My serpent blood can strike so cold
On any given day, I’ll take it all away
Another thought I can’t control

Turn your back on Mother Nature

Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 2]
Sometimes quiet is violent, I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 3]
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep, we
Need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire

Hey, hey, just obey
Your secret's safe with the NSA
In God we trust or the CIA?
Standing on the edge of a revolution
Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution

[Chorus]
No, we won't give up, we won't go away
'Cause we're not about to live in this mass delusion
No, we don't wanna hear another word you say
'Cause we know they're all depending on mass confusion
No, we can't turn back, we can't turn away
'Cause it's time we all relied on the last solution
No, we won't lay down and accept this fate
'Cause we're standing on the edge of a revolution

[Verse 2]
Wall Street, common thief
When they get caught they all go free
A brand new yacht and a finder's fee
Standing on the edge of a revolution
Same shit, different day
Can't keep fed if I can't get paid
We'll all be dead if the shit don't change
Standing on the edge of a revolution
Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution

[Chorus]
No, we won't give up, we won't go away
'Cause we're not about to live in this mass delusion
No, we don't wanna hear another word you say

No, we can't turn back, we can't turn away
'Cause it's time we all relied on the last solution
No, we won't lay down and accept this fate
'Cause we're standing on the edge of a revolution
(We'd all be dead if the shit don't change)

1080,Back To The ShackWeezer,"[Verse 1]
Sorry guys, I didn't realize that I needed you so much
I thought I'd get a new audience, I forgot that disco sucks
I ended up with nobody and I started feelin' dumb
Maybe I should play the lead guitar and Pat should play the drums

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack

[Verse 2]
I finally settled down with my girl and I made up with my dad
Had to go and make a few mistakes so I could find out who I am
I'm lettin' all of these feelings out even if it means I fail
'Cause this is what I was meant to do and you can't put that on sale

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack

[Bridge]
We belong in the rock world
There is so much left to do
If we die in obscurity, oh well
At least we raised some hell

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack"
1081,GirlsThe 1975,"[Verse 1]
Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where's the fun in doing what you're told?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said ""No!""
""Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night, I'll make you""
""I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior""
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

[Chorus]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Verse 2]
A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said ""Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with thirty-year-olds and you think you've made it
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?""
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

[Chorus]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Bridge]
I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I'll break your heart
Destined to be hard
Break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I said ""Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?""
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

[Chorus]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

Because they're just girls..."
1084,FlawsBastille,"[Verse 1]
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws
Are laid out one by one
A wonderful part of the mess that we made
We pick ourselves undone
All of your flaws and all of my flaws
They lie there hand in hand
Ones we've inherited, ones that we learn
They pass from man to man

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a hole in my soul
I can't fill it, I can't fill it
There's a hole in my soul
Can you fill it? Can you fill it?

[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

[Post-Chorus]
Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

[Verse 2]
All of your flaws and all of my flaws
When they have been exhumed
We'll see that we need them to be who we are
Without them, we'd be doomed

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a hole in my soul
I can't fill it, I can't fill it
There's a hole in my soul
Can you fill it? Can you fill it?

You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted

You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

All of your flaws and all of my flaws
Are laid out one by one
Look at the wonderful mess that we made

1085,BallastNothing More,"[Verse 1:]
When did we become these sinking stones?
When did we build this broken home?
Holding each other like ransom notes
Dropping our hearts to grip our brothers' throats

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't see because you don't know
You're caught below, beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside, half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?
Close your mind, identify
Do you feel, do you feel?
Do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score

We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

[Chorus:]
This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes we're walking blind

[Verse 2:]
Anchored in anger, we exile ourselves
Bitter blood builds our prison cell
Darker water now fills our lungs
The depths of our heart have blacked the sun

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Naked we come, naked we leave
Fools we are, to hold tightly
We are free, we are free
(We are the jail, we are the key) x2

[Chorus 2:]
This is the time that we let it go
Yeah, these are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we just open our eyes

[Chorus 3:]
This is the time that we let it go
And this is the pain we are forced to know
Singing the song that's inside, inside us all
Inside us all

Walking blind"
1086,Hunger Of The Pinealt-J,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sleeplessly embracing
Butterflies and needles
Line my seamed-up join
Encased in case I need it
In my stomach, for my heart
Chain mail

[Coda]
Hunger of the pine
Hunger of the pine

[Verse 2]
Sleeplessly embracing
Yawn yearns into me
Plenty more tears in the sea
And so you finally use it
Bedding with me you see at night
Your heart wears knight armour

Hunger of the pine

[Chorus]
(I'm a female rebel)
Sleeplessly
Embracing
You

[Verse 3]
Realisation grew on me
As quickly as it takes your hand
To warm the cool side of the pillow
I’m there for you, be there for me
I’ll hum the song the soldiers sing
As they march outside our window
Hunger of the pine

[Interlude]

Sleeplessly
Embracing
You
Sleeplessly
Embracing
You

1087,Gotta Get AwayThe Black Keys,"[Verse 1]
I got paid, then I was on the road
In a heartbeat, Mama said Mama said
You got a one track mind, but you ain't gonna get it all the time
She wasn't lyin'

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

[Verse 2]
My last dime, got used up
On gasoline, know what I mean, what I mean
Atlanta, GA by the end of the day
No other way, that's what I say

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

[Bridge]
And everything I had to say
Wish we'd gone so far away
Well now I
Can't stay

[Verse 3]
Blacktop, I can't stop
For no one, it's no fun, no fun
With a one track mind if you don't get lucky some time
But still I'm tryin'

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone"

Wadu-aidu-wadaidu...

[Verse 1]
There is a song
You're trembling to its tune
At the request of the moon
Licking her chops
She looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

[Chorus]
I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I said
What are you smoking?
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I said
What are you smoking?
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

[Verse 2]
Maybe the planets
Are trying to become the stars
And we really came from Mars
The earth is alive
And man is a parasite
And heavenly bodies make us fight

[Chorus]
I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I said
What are you smoking?
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I said
What are you smoking?
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

1090,HaterKorn,"[Intro]
You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, you won't ever bring me down!

[Verse 1]
I'm good, I'm fine, this life's divine
No hate, no shame, no one to blame
You might disguise, your life with lies
I won't chastise even if you think you can...

Bring me down!
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, You won’t ever bring me down!

I can't escape from your disdain
Your hurt, your pain, your drama is lame
Why can't you find some peace inside?
I won't chastise even when you think you can...

[Chorus]
Bring me down!
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, You won’t ever bring me down!

1091,The Negative OneSlipknot,"[Intro]
Fuck!

[Verse 1]
Fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I'm going to burn, so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind 'cause you're never going to give in
It's a crisis, just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Svengali, why are we the enemies?
I never follow, and I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna get ya
Because your walls can't support each other
Settle for the cynical, you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?

[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
I hope you live to see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die, you see my face
You're the only one to blame
Yeah
Fuck

[Bridge]
The prescient, the nascent, the quotient
They all will fall
The cystic, symbolic, condition
Systemic
Egregious, replete with these lesions
Contaminate
Succumb to the selfish creation
Your failure

[Verse 3]
No accountability, divisibility
I point a finger, but it's always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away, the killer is disavowed

[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
I hope you live to see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die, you see my face
You're the only one to blame
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one
The negative one
The negative one
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
Yeah"
1093,Beware The DogThe Griswolds,"[Verse 1]
We used to go
Where no one dared to go
And now you chase the dragon on your own
She used to suck the fun out of me
Beware the dog who's howling songs about defeat
Begging for love but you're old enough to know better than you know
You hate so much that you're better off alone

[Chorus]
She used to suck the life out of me
We used to joke and it felt like home
But now it's all just hazy
We used to walk where the wild things grow
But now you're fucking crazy
We used to go where the cool kids go
But now you're just too lazy
We used to joke and it felt like home
But now you're fucking crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy

Beware the ghost who lives on Salamander Road
Trapped in a cloud of smoke
It's old enough to know better than it knows
Hates so much you'd better leave that prick alone

She used to suck the life out of me
We used to [joke] and it felt like gold
But now it's all just hazy
We used to walk where the wild things grow
But now you're fucking crazy

But now you're just too lazy
We used to joke and it felt like home

I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

[Verse 1: Chris Mansfield]
My old man, he kicked me out, he kicked me out
When I told him that I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, he doesn't own me
He doesn't own me, he doesn't own me
He doesn't own me (Just escape!)

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 2: Chris Mansfield]
The black rims align your face
Like a deer drinking water in a picture frame
I swear to God I've seen those eyes
The back of my lids when closing mine
With clasped hands we shake it out, we shake it out
Lace our boots and we walk away
I felt slightly connected to him
And said now boy, now you own me

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He doesn't sleep
So in truth he never wakes up
Another day rushing to his death
Out of breath on the treadmill of the famous
He makes mistakes
Tells stories to his paintbrush
And when the world finally sees his art
He wishes that he never would have made it
Just escape, just escape
Ricochets and eclipses faith
Living in a city with a grey umbrella over your shoulders
And you're becoming suffocated by the weight
Can't hit those brakes, this is what you wanted, huh?
But you got it all in vain
'Cause you forgot who you are
Right as the world learned your name
It goes...

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Let me ash my issues
Ashtray as this asphalt
American spirits, black coffee
Conversations and a passport
When God gives you everything
Everything that you ever asked for
And it still looks a bit different
Than when you pictured it on that back porch
And I'm gone
World traveller all I got is my songs
When the nights start blending into one another, and I don't recall
Tom Petty in this motherfucker, all I wanna do is free fall
Yeah, free fall
And I'm so caught up, I'm caught up
I'm caught up and I'm so tired
Swore that I wouldn't stare into the light
And guess who tried it, shit, I'm blinded
By this lime light, this lime light
It's all night, it's all day
These bright lights, these bright lights
Once you turn 'em on you can't walk away
Don't die here, don't die here
I came too far, I'm too great
But I'm too scared, I'm too afraid
To stare this world into its face
I'm almost home, I'm driving lost
My eyelids close, life turns to grey
The cameras off, the show is over
You close the curtains and just escape

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Outro: Chris Mansfield]
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way

Well they say that we are tragic
And they say we're born to lose
You're the misfit

You're the heathen
I'm the fool

But today you'll be the master
Or the slave it's up to you
Oh my beautiful disaster
Take me anyway you choose

Don't fight it
Ignite it

Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
It may never be this good again

It's like a new religion
Speak in tongues come see the light
Do not trip on inhibitions
That will only waste my time

Let me tempt you with the evils
Of the flesh and so much more
Like a Babylon redeemer
Like a pusher like a whore

[Chorus]
Just try it
You'll like it
I’ll give you more

[Verse 3]
I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
It may never be this good again

It’s so dark I can't see
All the truth inside us
All I want is to feel
Something that’s real before the end

[Chorus]
Close the door
Turn the key
Do you like
What you see?

[Verse 4]
Kill the lights
Oh come to me
Set it off tonight
Baby just like fire and gasoline

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
I'm so fucking bored so trip the wire
It may never be this good again

[Chorus]
Just trip the wire
This world’s on fire
Just trip the wire
It may never be this good again"
1099,Trainwreck 1979Death From Above 1979,"[Verse 1]
I was born, on the highway, in a train wreck
With a heart, that was beating, out of my chest
So now I follow it, around the world, I can't keep up
If I don't get it soon, I know I'll bleed, until I drop

[Chorus]
Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

[Verse 2]
There's a darkness, and a hollow, on the highway
Every cross, on the roadside, tells a story
So now I follow it, around the world, I can't keep up
The story never ends, as long as we have blood and guts

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

[Bridge]
It ran off the track
In 11, 79 (eleven seven-nine)
While the immigrants slept
There wasn't much time
The mayor came calling
And got them out of bed
They packed up their families
And headed up wind
A poison cloud
A flaming sky
200,000 people
And no one died
And all before
The pocket dial
Yeah!

[Refrain]
I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

Now I'm stranded
Tied to the tracks
There's no hero
There's no villain
There's nobody I can blame
The story's still the same
I'm never satisfied
It's a problem with my brain

[Refrain]
I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

[Chorus]
Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

[Outro]
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough"

1107,It's TimeImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Bridge]
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am"
1108,Some Nightsfun.,"[Chorus 1]
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's alright
(That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I?

[Chorus 2]
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge 1]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No
When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

[Bridge 2]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

[Outro]
The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh"
1109,The A TeamEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Alternate Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die"

Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Verse 1: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Bridge: Nanna, Ragnar]
You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same

Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Hook]
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget

Now in some way
Shake the excess

As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

You know I'm not one to break promises

At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

Which way is right?
Which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're heading separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you

So I'll be on my way

You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's oh so much that you deserve
Nothing to say
Nothing to do

And beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you the one you can't repair
But I still love her
I don't really care

When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love is indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

For running like you did all these years
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up

1115,Carry Onfun.,"[Verse 1]
Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

[Verse 2]
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

[Bridge]
Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

[Bridge 2]
Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and

1116,Take A WalkPassion Pit,"[Verse 1]
All these kind of places
Make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone
My wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed a while
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so
At most I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
And there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came
Just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children
Play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Honey it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills
We had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward
To admit when I'm in need
I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh"
1117,Mountain SoundOf Monsters And Men,"[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I have caused with my two hands

[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar]
Along we travelled on, with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away...

[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, Ragnar]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran...

[Verse 2: Ragnar]
Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran...

[Post-Chorus 1: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa oh, oh, oh-oh
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Whoa oh, whoa oh
(We sleep until the sun goes down)

Whoa oh, whoa oh
(We sleep until the sun goes down)!

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran...

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)

Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran...

Take it off, take it in
Take off all the thoughts of what we've been
Take a look, hesitate
Take a picture you could never recreate
Write a song, make a note
For the lump that sits inside your throat
Change the locks, change the scene
Change it all, but can't change what we've been

[Chorus: Atlas Genius]
Oh, oh
Your trojan's in my head
Oh, oh
Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head

It's okay if it's gone
The thoughts that you had that it was the one
And, oh, what is left?
For all those times, is that what you get?
Oh, regardless, the walls get painted anyway
Oh, you're guarding the gates, but it all got away

[Chorus: Atlas Genius]
Oh, oh
Your trojan's in my head
Oh, oh
Your trojan's in my head

Change it all but can't change what we've been

Little black submarines
Operator, please put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back
Operator, please
This is wreckin' my mind

[Chorus]
Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

[Verse 2]
Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go to a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared to the back of my mind

They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow

Stolen friends and disease

1120,Flowers In Your HairThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair
See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

[Verse 2]
So then we grew a little and knew a lot
And how we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured
Cause it’s a long road to wisdom
But it’s a short one
To being ignored

[Chorus]
Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes
Aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart

[Verse 3]
So now i think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it’s not too late cause you’re so attractive
And the way you move
I won’t close my eyes
It takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

[Chorus]
Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes
Aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart"
1121,Chalk OutlineThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
I've been cursed, I've been crossed
I've been beaten by the ones that get me off
I've been cut, I've been opened up
I've been shattered by the ones I thought I loved

[Chorus]
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind is a chalk outline

[Verse 2]
I've been cold in the crypt
But not as cold as the words across your lips
You'll be sorry baby someday
When you reach across the bed where my body used to lay

[Chorus]
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind is a chalk outline

[Bridge]
All you left behind is a chalk outline
All you left behind

[Chorus]
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind is a chalk outline"
1123,BabelMumford,"[Verse 1]
‘Cause I know that time has numbered my days
And I’ll go along with everything you say
But I’ll ride home laughing, look at me now
The walls of my town, they come crumbling down
And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons
And I know their choices color all I’ve done
But I’ll explain it all to the watchman’s son
I never lived a year better spent in love

[Hook]
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask

(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride
I stretch my arms into the sky
I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now
Then the walls of my town, they come crumbling down
You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we’ve been
You know our breath is weak and our body thin

[Bridge]
Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should’ve known I was weaker from the start
You’ll build your walls and I will play my bloody part
To tear, tear them down
Well, I’m gonna tear, tear them down

[Hook]
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask"
1124,Slow It DownThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
I feel her filth in my bones
Wash off my hands til it's gone
The walls they're closing in
With velvet curtains

[Verse 2]
Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

[Verse 3]
They're makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo

[Chorus]
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

[Verse 4]
Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight

[Chorus]
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

[Verse 5]
And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you

[Verse 6]
I never, she never, we never looked back
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough on

[Outro]
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
Don't you frown when you're feelin like that
Only love can dig you out of this"
1125,Classy GirlsThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
Well she was standing in a bar
I said, ""hello
How do you do?""
She handed me a beer with a kangaroo
She spoke of places I had never been
That she had traveled to
And we slow danced alone to faster tunes
I made her laugh, I made a pass
I showed her my half-dollar ring
She said, ""that’s pretty cool,""
But classy girls don’t kiss in bars you fool
No they don't

[Verse 2]
So later on the crowd calmed down
And I believe it was as if
Something drew me closer to her
So picture my surprise when I had
Tried to lean in for a kiss
And she just smiled and turned her head down quick
I asked her why, and she replied
It was nothing I was doing wrong
It’s just what it is
But classy girls, don’t kiss in bars like this

[Chorus]
No classy girls don’t kiss in bars
Boys will break their backs and hearts
But it’s all right
The hardest part is through

Oh through
Oh through
Oh through
The hardest part is through"

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights

When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering

When you walk my way
I feel a rush come over me
A sharp panic panic
It's the things you say
That makes a rush come over me
It happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules (na na)
I'm better just pretending I was the fool

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough

And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young

If I walk away
I feel a push inside of me
That won't let me leave

For you to feel what's inside of me

1130,Dead SeaThe Lumineers,"[Verse 1]
I stood alone upon the platform in vain
The Puerto Ricans
They were playing their salsa in the rain
With open doors and manual locks
In fast food parking lots
I headed west I was a man on the move
New York it lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh I need somebody, I needed someone I could trust
And I don’t gamble, but if I did
I would bet on us

[Chorus]
Like the Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

[Verse 2]
You told me you were good at runnin' away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
They took the rest when you took a nap
Yes there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live it for yourself, you felt
You just felt it was time
And I’m glad, cause you with cats
That’s just not right

Like the Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me

You’re the message, I will heed it
Would you stay with me
Would you stay the night, oh

I believe submarines
Underneath deep blue sea
Saw the flags, Japanese
No one will believe me
Ran back to the town bar
And I told the people how
I had seen a submarine
And everyone laughed aloud

[Verse 2]
I did spy a periscope
Dead of night on the eastern coast
The police made them jokes
Told me I’d seen a ghost
Everyone thinks I’m a liar
No one knows the truth
If it was a bigger fire
I would be on the roof

[Interlude]
Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay
(Let me go)
No one trusts what I say
(I don’t know)
Oh my god, no one paid (attention)
Overnight my hair turned gray

I had none, so I will die with the secrets of the sea

Some choose to shout when they speak and they'll be the star
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice, one for tomorrow

We've just gained control)

Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery

Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky, guiding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow

There's one thing on my mind

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it
And put you on a wall

But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

1134,StarsGrace Potter,"[Verse 1]
I lit a fire with the love you left behind
And it burned wild and crept up the mountain side
I followed your ashes into outer space
I can't look out the window, I can't look at this place

[Chorus]
I can't look at the stars
They make me wonder where you are
Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard
And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far
So I, I can't look at the stars

[Verse 2]
All those times we looked up at the sky
Looking out so far, it felt like we could fly
And now I'm all alone in the dark of night
And the moon is shining, but I can't see the light

[Chorus]
And I can't look at the stars
They make me wonder where you are
Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard
And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far
So I, I can't look at the stars

1135,DrunkEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

[Verse 2]
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

[Pre-Chorus 2]
On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

[Bridge]
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

[Chorus]
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"
1136,CloserTegan And Sara,"[Verse 1]
All I want to get is a little bit closer
All I want to know is
Can you come a little closer?
Here comes the breath before we get
A little bit closer
Here comes the rush before we touch
Come a little closer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The doors are open, the wind is really blowing
The night sky is changing overhead

[Chorus]
It’s not just all physical
I’m the type who won't get oh so critical
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical

All I dream of lately is how to get you underneath me

Lovely girl, won’t you stay
Won’t you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see

[Verse 1]
Fleet of black, fleet of black limousines
These tinted machines, here comes the cavalcade
With the armored cars, armored cars like Berettas
Flags on antennaes designed to keep me safe, keep me safe

[Chorus]
And oh my my, oh hey hey
Here he comes, the candidate
Blue eyed boy, United States
Vote for him, the candidate

[Verse 2]
Diamonds cut, diamonds cut for the carrots
Plaster of Paris, the floats fill up the street
And the beauty queens, beauty queens with the white gloves
All sick from the night clubs, they wave with pageantry, pageantry

[Chorus]
Oh my my, oh hey hey
Here it comes, the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way, for the big parade

[Bridge]
Oh

[Verse 3]
Canvas covered, canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say, bookies say it’s the 3rd round
Oh, when Louie will go down
If he don’t, there’s hell to pay and hell to raise

[Chorus]
And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the welterweight
Take a dive, for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight

[Verse 4]
Catholic priest, Catholic priest in a crisis
He’s torn between romance and Jesus
Who will win the civil war
And he says I’m in love, I’m in love with a woman
Yeah, this is my confession
I’m leaving, I can’t be a priest anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
And oh my, oh hey hey
There he goes, the man of faith
Left the church for a fiance
Let him love, the man of faith

[Bridge]

[Verse 5]
TV cameras, TV cameras and stage hands
American Bandstand, electric guitars
And he’s singin' songs, singin' songs for the lonely
All the girls with the room keys
They know all his words by heart, by heart and they all sing

[Interlude]
All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl, won’t you stay

[Chorus]
Oh my my, oh hey hey
Here she comes by saving grace
Burn the car and save the plates
She’s arrived, my saving grace"
1139,In The EndBlack Veil Brides,"[Intro]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life?

[Verse 1]
In the end
As my soul's laid to rest
What is left of my body
Or am I just a shell?
And I have fought
And with flesh and blood I commanded an army
Through it all
I have given my heart for a moment of glory
(I gave it all)

[Chorus]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)

I'm not afraid to die
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to die

Born a saint
Though with every sin I still wanna be holy
I will live again
Who we are
Isn't how we live we are more than our bodies
If I fall I will rise back up and relive my glory

In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)

1140,Absolute ZeroStone Sour,"[Verse 1]
The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot, I can show you the truth
And I don’t need a reason to lie to you
No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don’t have a weapon, you can’t have mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the devil, but I won’t be your hero

[Verse 2]
The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your primadonnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react, it’s as simple as that
It’s better just to settle than face the facts

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the devil, but I won’t be your hero

[Bridge]
One thing that I can’t stand
Is when the minutes fight the second hand
I’ll waste a lifetime's worth just to cling to one more day

[Verse 3]
No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
Man is a four-letter word, it’s really absurd
The hate isn't fake it’s just inferred

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m not afraid
I’m giving into grievances again
I’m down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I’m not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You’re looking at an absolute zero
I’m not the devil, but I won’t be your hero"
1141,EnemiesShinedown,"[Verse 1]
Listen up, there's not a moment to spare
It's quite a drop from the top, so how you feeling down there?
It’s a cold, cruel, harsh reality
Caught stuck here with your enemies

Who do you think you are
Tearing us all apart?
Where did you think you could go?

You turned the ones that you love into the angriest mob
And their one last wish is that you pay for it
And there's no way you're getting out of this

Tearing us all apart?

1142,Heaven Nor HellVolbeat,"[Verse 1]
Well, I've heard that the Devil's walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
But stole it back and forever in debt

[Pre-Chorus]
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I feel his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you

[Chorus]
Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the Devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
Well, baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell

Well, I've heard that the morning star of a prince
Was invoked on a Monday on Earth
I found his business card in the mud

And for a moment I don't even care
Until I feel his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you

Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the Devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
Well, baby, I don't need any of them

Evil came down on Earth
And it beholds more than you love
More than you love

What you behold is no longer word

1143,Been Away Too LongSoundgarden,"[Verse 1]
You can't go home, no I swear you never can
You can walk a million miles and get nowhere
I got nowhere to go ever since I came back
Just filling in the lines from the holes to the cracks

[Chorus 1]
And no one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me

I've been away for too long

[Verse 2]
This place has a special kind of falling apart
Like they put the whole thing together in the dark
No one knows where the edge of the knife is
And no one knows where intelligent life is

[Chorus 1]
And no one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me

[Chorus 2]
But it's fate
I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
Though I never really wanted to stay
I’ve been away for too long
I've been away for too long
I've been away for too long

[Verse 3]
Kilos through key holes
Widows through windows
Pilots through eyelets
Everyone is silent
Tankards and flagons and snifters and flutes on my way home

[Chorus 2]
But it's fate
I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
Though I never really wanted to stay
I’ve been away but it's fake

I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
Though I never really wanted to stay
I’ve been away for too long

1144,Because We CanBon Jovi,"[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

[Verse 1]
She's in the kitchen staring out the window
So tired of living life in black and white
Right now she's missing those technicolor kisses
When he turns down the lights

Lately, he's feeling like a broken promise
In the mirror staring down his doubt
There's only one thing in this world that he knows
He said forever and he'll never let her down

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

TV and takeout on the coffee table
Paper dishes, pour a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
And for the moment everything is alright

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand

Because we can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we
We can, just wrap your arms around me

1146,Whispers In The DarkMumford,"[Verse 1]
You hold your truth so purely
And swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine

[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break a heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I loved
Under this sun!
Under this sun!

[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do

I'll bleed out for you

So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

[Verse 1]
When the day has come
That I’ve lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground

When the sky turns grey
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

And I close my eyes and I take it in

I’m bleeding out for you, for you

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering

When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

Sink into the soil, watch the water boil

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just

Somewhere another pretty vein just died (died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see

In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four, five meters runnin' 'round the bend
When the government agents surround you again

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 2]
Out of control but you're playing a role
Do you think you can go til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go it alone on your own for a bit

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Ooh, you let 'em go
Di-Di, Di-Di-Di-Di

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 3]
Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holdin' it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that goodnight

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on

Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 4]
Nobody knows what the future holds
And it’s bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, ’cause I hate suspense

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time"
1154,Carried AwayPassion Pit,"[Verse 1]
Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favourite little scene oh,oh

[Hook]
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

[Verse 2]
All your appeal, once again we'll feel it
Higher education making sense
Justify your thesis, certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense
Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want you
But I think I can fake it if you can
Let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oho

[Hook]
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

[Bridge]
Wake up in the morning, wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to
Cause no one's really watching
Won't you have something to say about it
But we all have problems
We're all having problems
And we all got something to say

[Hook]
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head"

She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine, your fever’s gripped me again
Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops (La la la la)
Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey (La la la la)
Break down, now weep, build up breakfast
Now let’s eat, my love, my love, love, love (La la la la)

The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up

1156,The High RoadThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
I told you I was hurt
Bleeding on the inside
I told you I was lost
In the middle of my life
There’s times I stayed alive for you
There’s times I would’ve died for you
There’s times it didn’t matter at all

[Chorus]
Will you help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I’ll take the high road out
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without

[Verse 2]
Standing in the dark
I can see your shadow
You’re the only light
That’s breaking through the window
There’s times I stayed alive for you
There’s times I would’ve died for you
There’s times it didn’t matter at all

[Chorus]
Will you help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I’ll take the high road out
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without

[Bridge]
Well I’m not going to give it away
Not going to let it go, just to wake up someday gone
Gone
The worst part is looking back
And knowing that I was wrong

[Chorus]
Help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I’ll take the high road out
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without

To be the mistake you can’t live without"
1157,The PitSilversun Pickups,"[Verse 1]
I am marching through the branches in a fit of wanderlust
To see you in a black hole reaching out for something just
Silhouettes of neighbors dancing in disgust

I’m sure you recognize my noise and you heard about the pit
Been told to be afraid of everything that lives within
But it’s much worse where you are
So will you go for it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I have a feeling you might
A feeling you might

[Chorus]
If somebody somewhere
Will clean out your wounds
Our dirty fingers
Will bury the lie

If somebody somewhere
Would clean out your wounds
And bury the lie
Bury the lie

[Verse 2]
Now we tumble down a hill to a fire with a crowd
The flicker becomes thicker as we bottom out
The residents don’t even notice the sudden shouts

When your eyes adjust and you see what’s in view
Discolored and distempered smiles that seem new
Do you realize they were all once like you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I have a feeling you might
A feeling you might

[Chorus]
If somebody somewhere
Will clean out your wounds
Our dirty fingers
Will bury the lie

[Bridge]
No, no
No one cares
Where no one goes

No, no
No one care
Where no one goes

[Verse 3]
You recognize my noise and you heard about the pit
Been told to be afraid of everything that comes within
We can talk about it later but I think you’ve given in
We can talk about it later but I think you’ve given in

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a feeling you might
Bury the lie

Oh, oh"
1158,HeroFamily Of The Year,"[Chorus]
Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else

[Verse]
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend

[Verse 2]
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else

[Chorus]
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else
Your masquerade

Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else"
1160,Holding On To Youtwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]
I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more ""shotty""
I bet a lot of me was lost,
""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you

[Verse 2]
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it, tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it to a tree tell it,
""You belong to me, this ain't a noose
This is a leash and I have news for you
You must obey me!""

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts

Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
And it's our hearts that make the beat

Singing blues has been getting old

I've been traveling too long (I've been traveling too long)
I've been trying too hard (I've been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
All I've got to keep myself sane, baby

Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

1170,God Is Dead?Black Sabbath,"[Verse 1]
Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

[Chorus 1]
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

[Verse 2]
Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

[Chorus 2]
When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

[Verse 3]
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing’s right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

[Chorus 3]
I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead

[Bridge]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 4]
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead"

Put on your war paint

[Verse 1]
You are a brick tied to me that’s dragging me down
Strike a match and I’ll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
Silver clouds with grey linings

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you’re waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
Like our time is running out?
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery

I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix

Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks

If I could find assurance to leave you behind
I know my better half would fade
And all my doubt is a staircase for you
Up and out of this maze

The first step is the one you believe in
The second one might be profound

Even trademark the color blue
Just like the tower we never built, in the shadow of all the guilt
When the other hand was pointed at you

And the second one might be profound

[Chorus]
I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm

I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you

Down to where forever lies, without a doubt I'm on your side
There's nowhere else that I would rather be
I'm not about to compromise, give you up to say goodbye
I'll guide you through the deep
I'll keep you close to me

I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm

Guided by the raven since his eyes don’t see
Hear him drag the rope that goes up to the hangman’s tree

I'm here to collect your hearts
It's the only reason that I sing
I don't believe a word you say
But I can't stop listening
This is the story of how they met
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes
And when she touched him he turned ruby red
A story that they'll never forget, never forget

Trapped in my brain
The itching is incomprehensible, and it won't stop
Am I alone?

You brought this on yourself

Now I'm back and I'm better than ever

The tears have left a blur that I can't explain
The pain has left a hole in which my heart should've been

Irrational, impetuous, intemperate

Love is blindness, I don't want to see

Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle

All the secrets, and nobody else to tell
Take the money
Why don't you honey?
Blindness

Love is blindness
I'm so sick of it, I don't want to see
Why don't you just take the night
Wrap it all around me?

Oh, I'm too numb to feel
Blow out the candles

1186,Rose TattooDropkick Murphys,"[Verse 1]
The pictures tell the story
This life has many shades
I’d wake up every morning and before I’d start each day
I’d take a drag from last nights cigarette
That smoldered in its tray
Down a little something and then be on my way
I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn’t be alone

[Chorus 1]
Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo

[Verse 2]
This ones for the mighty sea
Mischief, gold and piracy
This ones for the man that raised me
Taught me sacrifice and bravery
This ones for our favorite game
Black and gold, we wave the flag
This ones for my family name
With pride I wear it to the grave

[Chorus 2]
Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue
I ain't winning no one over

Stays here for eternity
A ship that always stays the course
An anchor for my every choice
A rose that shines down from above
I signed and sealed these words in blood
I heard them once, sung in a song
It played again and we sang along

[Bridge]
You’ll always be there with me
Even if you’re gone
You’ll always have my love
Our memory will live on

[Chorus 1]
Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo

[Outro]
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
With pride I’ll wear it to the grave for you
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
Signed and sealed in blood I would die for you"
1187,RiseSkillet,"[Verse 1: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
All I see is shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain in a world we made
Everyday you need
A bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

[Chorus: John Cooper]

Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, we rise

Rise

Rise, rise

[Verse 2: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
Like a hand grenade
Thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos
Trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb
And when the scars heal
The pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes
Darkness fades away
And the light shines on a brave new day

[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

[Bridge: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
In a world gone mad
In a place so sad
Sometimes it's crazy, crazy
To fight for what you believe
But you can't give up, no
If you wanna keep what you love!
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Never give up, no

[Interlude 1]

Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

[Verse 2]
You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
(It's not enough)
You just threw away the key
To your heart
You don't get burned

It makes it easier
(Easier on you)
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see
Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

There's a light, and I can see it in your eyes
There's a memory of the way you used to be
Nothing's gone, it still shines, every time you turn it on
And when you slow it down...

[Verse 1]
People working every night and day
Never give yourself no time
Got too many bills to pay
Slow down, nothing's gonna disappear
If you give yourself some room
To move to the music you hear

[Chorus]
Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet

[Verse 2]
People looking for the great escape
Looking to the greener side
Trying to find a better way
Slow down, open up your big brown eyes
Feel the rhythm in your heart
You don't even need to try

[Chorus 2]
Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Nothing is wrong, if you move to the beat
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Stompa your feet

When you can't seem to shake off all the feelings that are breaking
Little pieces of the music that's in you
All the pain that you feel
I can prove it's not real
There's just one thing you gotta do

Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Nothing is wrong, if you move to the beat
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet

Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
So come on

[Verse 1]
White boy on the beat rocking Gucci sneaks
All I do is win, Charlie Sheen
Started out in '06 and revived the scene
So many motherfuckers wanna be like me
Came from the lowest of lows, rose to the top with a vision
My haters talking shit while washing dishes for a living
Fuck you, bitches, I'm a business, I'll be kissing on your missus
What you spend in 15 months is what I spend in 15 minutes

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, don't give a fuck about you
You're feeling froggy, motherfucker? Ain't a damn thing you can do
You're a bitch, you're a punk, don't make me pull the pump
Cock it back and leave you slumped, now that's what I call bad luck

[Chorus]
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of people talking nothing but chatter
""Why'd you switch your style up?"" and that I don't matter
Man, I've been in rap since I was shitting in pampers
Climbed the ladder to the top, and now I'm shitting on rappers
All I do is work, straight up hustle and grind
So many people mad at me for crossing the line
I find it kinda funny, the shit you say in your tweets
But when we're face-to-face, you ain't got nothing to say to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, so fuck you too
You better take a step back before I call up the crew
You talk a lot of shit, but you spread nothing but lies
You keep on running your mouth, you better open your eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, break your neck
So break your motherfucking neck
I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, break your neck
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world, so break your motherfucking neck

Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

[Verse 2]
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

[Chorus]
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky

And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall?"

Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon

[Chorus]
I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

[Verse 2]
We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save them we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
“You need to let go, you got no control""
No

I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

This weight’s too much alone
Some days I can’t hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you
Yea when tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you

I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you

Ha-ha-haunted
The throat is deep and the mouth is wide
Saw some things on the other side
Made me promise to never tell
But you know me I can't help myself, no

Now I got something you have to see
They put something inside of me
Its smile is red and its eyes are black (black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
I don't think I'll be coming back

I don't believe it I-
I had to see

I said goodbye but I

Everywhere now reminding me
I am not who I used to be
I'm afraid this has just begun
Consequences for what I've done

Taking over this town, they should worry
But these problems aside, I think I taught you well
That we won't run, and we won't run, and we won't run

And in the winter night sky, ships are sailing
Looking down on these bright blue city lights
And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait
We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay

Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
A lionheart

His crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
Past the wandering eyes of the ones that were left behind
Though far away, though far away, though far away
We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same

[Chorus 2: Nanna, Ragnar]
Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart

And in the sea that's painted black
Creatures lurk below the deck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart

And as the world comes to an end
I'll be here to hold your hand
'Cause you're my king and I'm your lionheart

Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in (Oh, oh, oh)
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in (Oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

[Verse 2]
Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest?
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh, oh, oh)
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made its home inside (Oh, oh, oh)

If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?

I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me

I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger"
1204,Hail To The KingAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore
Royal flames will carve the path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night (Night)
Death is riding into town with armor
They come to take all your rights

[Chorus]
Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)
The King

[Verse 2]
Blood is spilled while holding keys to the throne
Born again but it’s too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid
Let the water flow with shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light (Light)
Death is riding into town with armor
They come to grant you your rights

[Chorus]
Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)
The King

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
There's a taste of fear (Hail, hail, hail)
When the henchmen call (Hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to tame them (Hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to claim it all

[Chorus]
Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king (Hail, hail, hail)
The King"
1205,ReflektorArcade Fire,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

[Pre-Chorus - Régine Chassagne]
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

[Chorus]
I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

[Verse 2]
Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

[Pre-Chorus - Variation - Régine Chassagne]
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
Cause you're my home

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

[Bridge 1]
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
All right, let's go back

[Verse 3]
Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

[Chorus]
I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)

It’s a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor

We all got things to hide
It’s just a Reflektor

1207,Million Dollar BillsLorde,"[Verse 1]
There's nothing I want but money and time
Million dollar bills and the tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel than only nine lives
Unlimited spines would do the trick-trick-trick-trick

[Chorus]
We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go

[Verse 2]
There's nothing as fun as coming untied
And running with the kids in the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt like letting you go
It's tiger burn eyes in the dark-dark-dark-dark

[Chorus]
We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with all our people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free-flow

[Outro]
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know"
1208,SupersoakerKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
My motivation has gone too soon
Good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it, you mean it
You've got a story you never tell
Down in the delta I'm ringing bells
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind I'm on my way
I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Verse 2]
The flags are flying across the plains
I've got a secret picking at my brain
I wanna see you, see you
The exit sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place
I just wanna be there, be there

[Bridge]
Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Verse 1]
We were just kids just living in wide-eyed innocence
Minivan floor like a tenement
We were just kids who believed in
More than just dreams in
More than just justified
Ends to a means
With the sky wide open

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a child, eyes-open
Like a child, unbroken
By the wheels gone by
We know

Who we are (in the fever of our youth)
Who we are (We’ve got nothing left to lose)
Who we are (There’s still time enough to choose)
Who we are

We were just kids
Just limited, misfit, itinerant
Outcasts singing bout the dissonance
We were just kids, wide-open

Like a child, unbroken
By the wheels gone by
We know

They said it’s complicated
They said we’d never make it this far
But we are
They said the fight would break us
But the struggle helped to make
Who we are

1210,ElephantTame Impala,"[Verse 1]
Well, he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreamin' about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mister Shuck
To get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
He's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)

[Verse 2]
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (Yeah)
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing when they saw him again
That's how it is 'til the end (Yeah)"
1211,Trying To Be CoolPhoenix,"[Verse 1]
City and desert coexist
Depending on the things you're wearing
Wildlife binoculars
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want me

They teach you suffer to resist
Too much intention, Presbyterian
Mint julep testosterone
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want me

[Chorus]
Cool
I'm just trying to be cool
It's all because of you
Some fanatic attitude we're both on

[Post-Chorus]
Open for business says it all, you can't go wrong
Is innocent too immature where you’re from?
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want it all

[Verse 3]
Two dozen pink and white ranunculus
Why? What are the problems to solve?
To part-time holy bachelors
Tell them that you want me
Tell them that you want me

[Chorus]
Cool
I'm just trying to be cool
It's all because of you
Some fanatic attitude we're both on

[Post-Chorus]
Open for business says it all, you can't go wrong
Compliments sound too cynical where you're from
Tell me that you want me
Tell me what they want is

Gruesome
I don't care where you're from
Nothing's that personal
There is no physical evidence of cannibal boyfriends

Tell me that you want me

Why don't you tell me that you want me?
Tell me that you want it all"
1212,HurricaneMS MR,"[Verse 1]
Didn't know what this would be
But I knew I didn't see
What you thought
You saw in me
I jumped the gun
So sure you'd split and run
Ready for the worst
Before the damage was done

[Verse 2]
The storm never came
Or it never was
Didn't know getting lost in the blue
It meant I wound up losing you

[Chorus]
Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart
Hurricane

[Verse 3]
What's wrong with me
Why not understand and see
I never saw
What you saw in me
Keep my eyes open
My lips sealed
My heart closed
And my ears peeled

[Chorus]
Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart
Hurricane

Make ash and leave the dust behind
Lady diamond in the sky
Wild light
Glowing bright to guide me
When I fall
When I fall on tragedy

Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart

1214,WildfireJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

[Chorus]
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

[Verse 2]
Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather
In his medicine bag

1215,HomeJack Johnson,"[Verse]
I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
There's food on the ground and the birds have all moved back
Into my attic, whistling static when the young learn to fly
I will patch all the holes up again

Well, I can't believe that my lime tree is dead
I thought it was sleeping, I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too, I keep food in my belly
And hope that my time isn't soon, isn't soon

And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
Because this place is overgrown it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too

In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
We went walking so far that it grew back again
And there's no trail at all only grass growing taller
Get out my machete battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose because I'll be down if time don't win

I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
All the seeds from the fruits buried and began their
Own family trees teach them, thank you and please
They spread their own roots, then watch their young fruit grow again
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins

And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
Because this place is overgrown, it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
I said, Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too"
1216,Mind Your MannersPearl Jam,"[Verse 1]
I've got an unfortunate feeling
I been beaten down
I feel that I'm done believing
Now the truth is coming out
What they've taken is more than a vow
They've taken your innocence
And then they throw em on a burning pile

[Chorus]
All along they're saying
""Mind your manners!""

[Verse 2]
I caught myself believing
That I needed God
And if it's out there somewhere
We sure could use hymn now
Try my patience!
My patience tried
This world's a long love letter
That makes me want to cry
Ah ah ay ay

[Chorus]
All along they're saying
""Mind your manners!""
That's all they're saying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And all along they're saying
Mind your manners
Always praying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries

Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

Mind strong, body strong
Try to find equilibrium
Head straight, screwed on
We screwed up for too long
I don't want to lean on the waves
I watched the storm evaporate
I think of you and starry skies
That keeps you so alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's walk through the fire together
Disappear in the golden sands

Open arms and finger tips
Love bites, and recompense
I'll be with you until the end

1219,Face To The FloorChevelle,"[Verse 1]
To pick up the tip doesn't mean a lot
Fiddle inside your drawers
If we own the night, then spread it out
Or pack up without a clue

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, caused by their own
And by default
Time to vamanos

[Chorus]
Like your face getting forced to the floor

Then I got a taste of the benefits
Five foot and change
There's no better way to hash it out
So let's set up your time to fail

Well course now the cracks
Should we intervene?
I hold this albatross

Like your face getting forced to the floor
And either way, you're way too close to it all

Clever, Madoff, take it all
Take it all

Take it all the way, right back down

Pay up, never take it all
Take it all

Like your face getting forced to the floor

And either way, you're way too close to it all

Now
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice but knowin' to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never want to die
I never want to die, I never want to die
I'm on my knees, I never want to die
I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire
Forever, whenever, I never want to die
I never want to leave, I never say goodbye
Forever, whenever, forever, whenever

The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask, and are you up to task?
The calicos of Pettibon where cultures come to clash

No one in here is on trial
Its just a turn-around

Well and we go, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey, now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

'Cause I’ll be gone, bye, bye, bye, yeah
Bye bye, bye, girl

1225,Cough SyrupYoung The Giant,"[Verse 1]
Life's too short to even care at all, whoa oh-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control
These fishes in the sea, they're staring at me
Whoa oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum, oh-whoa oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some fortune that
I, I should have found
By now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down, come down

Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa, oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now
Out of the blue, oh-oh, oh-oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh-whoa, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun
Oh-whoa oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 2]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that
I, I should have found
By now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down

1226,Buried AliveAvenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that you might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real
Still I'm on my way (On and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take

[Chorus]
Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

[Verse 2]
I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes)
Wash my view away

[Chorus]
Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever

[Bridge]
And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

[Verse 3]
Take you down now
Burn it all out
Throw you all around
Get your fucking hands off me!
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul

[Verse 4]
While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with hands of fate
Shame to find out when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within

[Outro]
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life (what’s it feel like?)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what’s it feel like?)
Die buried alive (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life
Die buried alive"
1227,Shake It OutFlorence + The Machine,"[Verse 1]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa (shake him off)

[Verse 3]
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
(shake him off)
And given half the chance, would I take any of it back
(shake him off)
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
(shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa

[Bridge]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Well, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me
Yeah

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

You won't know your worth now, son, until you take a hit
And you won't find the beat until you lose yourself in it

[Chorus]
That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

[Verse 2]
You can't fill your cup until you empty all it has
You can't understand what lays ahead if you don't understand the past
You'll never learn to fly until you're standing at the cliff
You can't truly love until you've given up on it

[Chorus]
That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

[Verse 3]
She told me she that she'd never face the world again
So I offered up a plan:

[Bridge]
We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night
We'll come clean and start over
The rest of our lives
When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind
It's not too late, we have the rest of our lives
We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night (we have the rest of our lives)
We'll come clean and start over
The rest of our lives
When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind (we have the rest of our lives)
It's not too late, we have the rest of our lives
The rest of our lives

[Chorus]
Because we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me (shine your light on me)
No we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny (shine your light on me)
I'm passing over you like a satellite
'cause these are the things that we can't deny, no
This is a life that you can't deny us now"

Oh, dear mother, I love you
I'm sorry, I wasn't good enough
Dear father, forgive me
'Cause in your eyes, I just never added up

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In my heart I know I failed you
But you left me here alone

[Chorus]
If I could hold back the rain, would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

[Verse 2]
Oh, dear brother, just don't hate me
For never standing by you or being by your side
Dear sister, please don't blame me
I only did what I thought was truly right

It's a long and lonely road
When you know you walk alone

[Chorus]
If I could hold back the rain, would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

[Bridge]
I feel like running away, I'm still so far from home
You say that I'll never change, but what the fuck do you know?
I'll burn it all to the ground before I let you win
Please forgive me, I can't forgive you now
I remember everything

[Chorus]
If I could hold back the rain, would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

[Outro]
It all went by so fast
I still can't change the past
I always will remember
Everything
If we could start again
Would that have changed the end?
We remember
Everything
Everything"

[Verse 1: Dcoy Link]
Good girls might scandal
When you ridin' bad bitches on your bike handle
When days are dark friends make like eggs and scramble
Life's a bitch but she pretty from the right angle
Guns blazing, that's how I'm going out
Niggas wishing I was gone should light a candle
Make a wish and blow it out
I'm no magician no pulling rabbits outta hats
But I could pull a dagger out and stab it in a back
I got 'em catchin' high notes and they don't sing too well
Don't trust friendship cause Ships sink and I don't swim too well
That nigga bitch got ass but he a bitch ass nigga
Put some money on her ass now she shit cash nigga
She hot as hell she probably the devil's bitch
But if I got her sucking mine then who's sucking the devil's dick
I'm like the twin towers right before they leveled it
I might just blow up but fuck it I ain't celibate
They making they breast bigga all these body building hoes
If I wasn't rapping i'd be lifting weights but I ain't talking body building though
I got the whip doing gymnastics
The wheels stop spinning then the top do a back flip

[Hook]

You wanted me for yourself

But I guess this what I do I cheetos, Chester cheetah
I ain't ashton kutcher and you ain't watching punk'd
Put her to the test and yeah she motherfuckin' flunked
I had her blowing on my shit like it's a blunt
I ain't taking shots at you this a slam dunk
But as far as the jokes go
She said I never find a chick like her
God I hope so
Had a chance but you blew it I'm not surprised
Though I made you cry I was just doing me cuz I'm obliged"

1246,Bitch Came BackTheory Of A Deadman,"[Chorus:]
The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn't stay away
Don't you know the bitch came back?

[Verse 1:]
I like her so much better when she's down on her knees
Cause when she's in my face that's when I'm starting to see
That all my friends were right for thinking that we'd be wrong
Well she's so fuckin' stupid bet she's singing along
The trouble with girls is they're all the same
Forget the diamonds and pearls they just want a ring
Before you know it you're like a dog on a leash
Well you can try and change the world but you won't change me

[Chorus:]
The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn't stay away
Don't you know the bitch came back?

There she goes again she's always breaking my balls
No matter what I do somehow it's always my fault
She says I must be cheating cause I turned off my phone
But that's the only frickin' way she'll leave me alone
The trouble with girls is it's never enough
They love to complain and they never shut up
They like to tell you the way it ought to be
Go on and tell the world but just don't tell me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
It ain't a joke when I say I wanna throw you out
(I really mean it, I really mean it)
Well look who's laughing now!
The bitch came, the bitch came back
The bitch came, the bitch came back
The bitch came, the bitch came back
She just couldn't stay away
The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she won't stay the fuck away

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter

All that you got

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise the cup
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Life tearing at the seams

It's like we just can't help ourselves
Cause we don't know how to back down

We were called out to the towns
How the heavens they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain-washed histories
Well, we do not need to be told

Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

I was called out in the dark
By a choir of beautiful cheats
And as the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

[Chorus]
We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this is your time
We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this is your time"

You'd stand and watch me bleed

[Verse 1]
She was the one thing I believed
That I needed to hold me
Still I can smell her hear her breath
Feel her body beside me

How long I've waited, waited for you
To come back to hold me
What should I, what should I, what should I do
When I feel so lonely?

[Pre-Chorus]
How could you do this to me?
Betrayed by my closest friend
How could you do this to me?
I won't let you hurt me again now

[Chorus]
I'm nothing to you I can see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn apart I can't believe
You'd stand and watch me bleed

[Bridge]
What should I, what should I do?
Oh how long I have waited
What can I, what can I do
When I feel so lonely?

(Guitar Solo)

[Pre-Chorus]
How did you think I would feel
You throw me aside again
How did you think I would feel
I won't let you hurt me again now

[Chorus]
I'm nothing to you I can see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn apart I can't believe
You'd stand and watch me bleed

[Post-Chorus]
How could you do this to me
Betrayed by my closest friend
How could you do this to me
I won't let you hurt me again

I am the waiting one it seems..."
1264,Calamity SongThe Decemberists,"[Intro]
(You and me in the war)

[Verse 1]
Had a dream
You and me in the war of the end times
And I believe
California succumbed to the fault line
We heaved relief
As scores of innocents died

[Chorus 1]
And the Andalusian tribes
Setting the lea of Nebraska alight
Till all that remains is the arms of the angels

[Verse 2]
Hetty Green
Queen of supply-side bonhomie bone-drab
You know what I mean
On the road
It's well advised that you follow your own bag
In the year of the chewable Ambien tab

[Chorus 2]
And the Panamanian child
Stands at the Dowager Empress's side
And all that remains is the arms of the angels
And all that remains is the arms of the angels

[Hook]
Ah ooh
Ah ooh, ooh, oh
Ah ooh
Ah ooh, ooh, oh

[Bridge]
And you've receded into loam
And they're picking at your bones
We'll come home
We'll come home

[Verse 3]
Quiet now
Will we gather to conjure the rain down?
Will we now
Build a civilization below ground?
And I'll be crowned the community kick-it-around

[Chorus 1]
And the Andalusian tribes
Setting the lea of Nebraska alight
'Til all that remains is the arms of the angels
'Til all that remains is the arms of the angels

Ah ooh, ooh, oh
Ah ooh
Ah ooh, ooh, oh
Ah ooh

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 1]
It’s 8 A.M
This hell I’m in
Seems I’ve crossed the line again
For being nothing more than who I am

So break my bones
And throw your stones
We all know that life ain’t fair
But there is more of us
We’re everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
We don’t have to take this
Back against the wall
We don’t have to take this
We can end it all

[Chorus]
All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No one's gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Think it through
You can’t undo
Whenever I see black and blue
I feel the past
I share the bruise

With everyone
Who’s come and gone
My head is clear
My voice is strong
Now I’m right here to right the wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
We don’t have to take this
Back against the wall
We don’t have to take this
We can end it all

All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No one's gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

It’s 8 A.M.!
The Hell I’m in!
Your voice is strong!
Now right the wrong!

All you’ll ever be

Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

1268,Simple SongThe Shins,"[Verse 1]
Well this is just a simple song
To say what you done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Made warm by the sun

When I was just nine-years-old
I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest;
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest

[Chorus]
I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone
Could be there’s nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

[Verse 2]
My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift!
You tell me with your tongue
And your breath was in my lungs
And we float up through the rift

[Chorus]
I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone
Could be there's nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

[Bridge]
Well this would be a simple song
To say what you done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Made warm by the sun

[Chorus 2]
Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the act struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Especial for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
Which I never knew"
1270,In My BloodBlack Stone Cherry,"[Verse 1]
Right here
Right now
We’re falling apart while were falling down
Who knew to hurt would feel this good
Move along so far from home
My mistakes go on and on
In truth I hate to be alone

[Chorus]
It’s in my blood and it’s in my bones
In my heart and it’s in my soul
And when I’m gone I hope you’ll understand
(I hope you’ll understand)
When I get home I will make amends
When Tuesday comes I’ll be gone again
And when I’m gone
I hope you’ll understand
(I hope you’ll understand)
I hope you’ll understand

It’s in my blood

[Verse 2]
I miss your touch and I miss your smile
The thing you do that drives me wild
But you know
It’s the way it has to be
Another day and another round
I miss the friends in my hometown
But in truth it’s the reason that I leave

[Chorus]
It’s in my blood and it’s in my bones
In my heart and it’s in my soul
And when I’m gone I hope you’ll understand
When I get home I will make amends
When Tuesday comes I’ll be gone again
And when I’m gone
I hope you’ll understand (I hope you’ll understand)

[Bridge]
Would you love me the same
If I never started dreamin’
Are we better this way
Ever since I started leavin’

[Chorus]
It’s in my blood and it’s in my bones
In my heart and it’s in my soul
And when I’m gone I hope you’ll understand
When I get home I will make amends
When Tuesday comes I’ll be gone again
And when I’m gone
I hope you’ll understand (I hope you’ll understand)

When I get home I will make amends
When Tuesday comes I’ll be gone again
And when I’m gone
I hope you’ll understand (I hope you’ll understand)

When I get home I will make amends
When Tuesday comes I’ll be gone again
And when I’m gone
I hope you’ll understand
I hope you’ll understand

Hey baby won't you look my way
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby what you got to say
All you're giving me is fiction

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm a sorry sucker
And this happens all the time
I find out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her

1274,Drive ByTrain,"[Verse 1]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

[Verse 2]
On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause...

This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya

Oooo, wooo

[Verse 1]
Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

[Hook]
Oooo-ooo-ooo

[Verse 2]
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We’ll run wild
We’ll be glowing in the dark

Oooo-ooo-ooo
We’ll be glowing in the dark
A-woo,-a-wooooo

All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes

So we’ll soar
Luminous and wired
We’ll be glowing in the dark"

Roar at the door

1280,Look AroundRed Hot Chili Peppers,"[Verse 1]
Stiff club, its my nature
Custom love is the nomenclature
Turn down mass confusion
Hit the road 'cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision
Long hard look at my last decision
Hustle here, hustle there
Hustle me bitch and you best beware

[Refrain]
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know, so I told you

Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This is for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will

Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around

It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you

[Verse 3]
Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street life out my window
City made breeze gonna stroke my skindow
Just a lot of words on an old brick wall
Rob a lot of banks, got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care

Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!

One, two, one, two
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Don't listen what your girlfriend says
She reads those magazines
That say you failed the test
You don't have what she needs
I slither like a viper and get you by the neck
I know a thousand ways to help you forget about her

That bitch can eat her heart out
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites

[Verse 2]
My lips are pale and vicious
You're foamin' out the mouth
You've suffered in the darkness
I'll suck the pain right out
So come and taste the reason, I'm nothin' like the rest
I kiss you in a way, you'll never forget about me

[Chorus 2]
That chick can eat her heart out
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I

[Bridge]
It sucks you in and kicks you down
And chews you up and spits you out
It messes with your sanity by twisting all your thoughts around
They say it’s blind, they say it waits
But every time it seals your fate
Now it's got you by the balls and won't let go until you fall
I was down and out, got up, and said
“Hey love, I've had enough”
I've felt pleasure without pain
My soul you'll never tame

Love bites, but so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I

1282,This Means WarNickelback,"[Verse 1]
Climb into the ring for a battle that you can't win
Swing as hard as you can swing, it will still mean nothing
Should’ve seen it coming, it had to happen sometime
But you went and brought a knife to an all out gun fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

[Chorus]
You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war

[Verse 2]
Say anything you want, but talk will get you nowhere
The only thing you've brought was psychological warfare
Well, there’s no getting out
And now you gotta wonder
Who will dig you out when you’re six feet under?

[Pre-Chorus]
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

[Chorus]
You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war

And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?

We're building it up to break it back down

And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down

Run to the light
It won't save you tonight
All our yesterdays are pictures lost in time
Never enough
Towers crumble to dust
Looking back on the moments of our lives

All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost

Stars still burn bright
Seasons change overnight
As we find our way, the times, they come and go
Look back in love
A new day rises above
With a wind that comes to carry you back home

Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by

What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again

Don't bleed on their own
You paid for an eyeful
So behold the bull

Why can't I look up (out in the clearing)
Tell me what's there below (end over end)
While he's safe for the moment (guess what he's learning)
He's never safe from the crowd

So hats off to the bull, no giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends?

To be monumental
Could mean the beyond
The simpler the treasure
Means the higher the cost

Well as for the ending (damn right I'm learning)
You might ask for the door (end over end)
Well I hate how the clouds hide
The gasps from above

So hats off to the bull, no giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends?

[Bridge]
Find your challenge, suffer miles
Colors grey, he brings them out
Don't mind the challenge, suffer miles
A little shallow, if I don't say

Hats off to the bull, his time ain't up
Bitter hell in the lion's den, for some of us
Hats off to the bull, the sun won't set

Either way, it makes ya mad, well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all

You’re the voice of reason that I can’t escape
Cut me down a thousand times a day
I don’t need you anymore
I don’t need you anymore
I trusted you when there was no one else
All you did was make me doubt myself
Don’t believe you anymore
Don’t believe you anymore
You bled me out, you tore me down
Your time has come, you can go

Because you’re a lie (Lie), lie (Lie)

Drowned you out
And left you with the sounds
Of spoiled goodnights
Replacing lullabies

How could they never notice
What they planted in your spades?
See you laughing in a picture
But I know what's out of frame

You barely cried
But you made it out alive
And I'm so proud
That you're in my hands now

If we grew up together
You would find it's not the same
I wanna jump inside that picture
And show you a new game

If you can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
Say her name into the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
She can chase us through the dark
Activate our nerve endings

We'll stay...

I'll never let them get closer
Or shower you with any blame
Now we dance in our own picture
Where the rules have changed

If you can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
Say her name into the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we can stay here long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
She can chase us through the dark
Activate our nerve endings

We'll stay..."

Oh, won't you let me twist your faith
It's gettin' kinda late and I don't wanna wait no more
Oh, may I have this dance of days
Locked in your embrace, passed your test of faith

Another line upon your face, another in your way
Down crooked stairs and sideways glances
Comes the king of second chances, now throw him in the flame

Salute the sun, I've been sitting here all night long
Hauling rock over Buddha with the Longhorn
Got a hole, rip a pocket off my uniform
With the Blackwatch Boys get your heads down

Duty calls but it is way too late I'm too far gone
Waiting for Godot, hell with my pants down
Cracked the stash sent me crying in the midday sun
I miss my dog and I miss my freedom

They know I'm here just out of sight

I hate the things I think about you when I'm all alone
I know you're tough but I've been gone for so long
I play the memories of you inside my head
So all those pictures of us burn and radiate

Watch the clouds and I'm falling, falling through the cracks
Head beats and the heart is pounding fast
Off the ground into the starry dark
Into your arms I'm falling
I'm falling, I'm falling

We lifted this house we lifted this house
Fire-crackers in the east my car parked south
Your hands on my cheeks your shoulder in my mouth

1302,UnityShinedown,"[Verse 1]
I found a note with your name
And a picture of us
Even though it was framed
And covered in dust
It’s the map in my mind that sends me on my way

They say it’s never too late
To stop being afraid
And there is no one else here
So why should I wait?
And in the blink of an eye the past begins to fade

So have you ever been caught in a sea of despair?
And your moment of truth
Is the day that you say “I’m not scared”

[Chorus]
Put your hands in the air
If you hear me out there
I’ve been looking for you day and night
Shine a light in the dark
Let me see where you are
‘Cause I’m not gonna leave you behind

If I told you that you’re not alone
And I show you this is where you belong
Put your hands in the air
One more time

[Verse 2]
I’ve seen a million miles
Met a million faces
Took all I knew
To reach all these places
And I’d do it again
If it brings me back to you

So have you ever been caught in a sea of despair?
And your moment of truth
Is the day that you say “I’m not scared”

Put your hands in the air
If you hear me out there
I’ve been looking for you day and night
Shine a light in the dark
Let me see where you are

And I show you this is where you belong

Shine a light in the dark

When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Verse 1]
You can't tell me what to say 'cause I've got one religion
And I've got one decision, it's a big ""fuck you""
I keep spitting in your face, every month and every day
Every time you hear my name, my middle finger's up too
You think I owe you, but I ain't got no room for these hoes
'Cause they're no good, I ain't living by your rules
You're getting old, dude, full of liquor, you're bloated
And you wanna be noticed, but you're dying so slowly

[Pre-Chorus]
So when they point the finger, you flip one back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""
So when they point their finger, we'll flip ours back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""

[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Verse 2]
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, each one of you's gonna know
That your time is coming soon 'cause there ain't enough room
In this world for us too, yeah, I hate to break the news
But I'mma break it in this music and let the world know who
Who you've been using, who you're abusing, it's this youth that you're fooling
But you know that you're useless, always acting so ruthless
Deep inside you're just ruined 'cause I keep on moving, here to show you the truth, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
So when they point the finger, you flip one back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""
So when they point their finger, we'll flip ours back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""

[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Bridge]
Why can't you die?
Motherfucker, just die
No more goodbyes
Just fucking die

[Chorus]
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name
In a world that's insane, why's America to blame
When you're praying for a change to a god with no face?

[Outro]
So when they point the finger, you flip one back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that""
They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate
Like a fucking AK, it's going up in flames
So when they point their finger, we'll flip ours back and say
""Fuck that, fuck that"""

Have you seen my hands?
Just look at 'em shake
And the song just keeps on repeating
Drop the needle again
And I dance with your ghost
Oh but that ain't the way

But have you seen my heart?
Have you seen how it bleeds?
And the nights are so long baby
Out here in the deep
The tick, ticking of hours lonely

I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms
But Better Sense says

Do you see the world in different colors?
Do you see the world in black and gray?
Alone in your thoughts, how many others
Have stood where you stand, where you stand today
I've stood where you stand, but oh can you...

[Chorus]
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now

The promise of safe return I delivered
But the ocean is wider than I first guessed
When roads disappeared I followed the rivers
But somehow got in over my head
So a deep breath I'm taking

[Chorus]
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now

[Verse 3]
A lost dream of what could have been
A house on fire, a tangled web
The key turns to find the locks have changed
In time to hear the back door slam
A sound that to this day I can't forget
The colors drained to black and gray
Oh...

[Chorus]
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now

No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
""Never let your fear decide your fate""

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause

1321,Jump Into The FogThe Wombats,"[Verse 1]
What a great achievement it was
To get a hotel room this late
I'll bet they charge by the hour here
The kind of place you should bring your own UV ray

It's not a big problem with me, love
You don't look that hygienic, anyway
I'm only here because
I wanna twist the structure of my average day

[Chorus 1]
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your bones that shatter, not mine

We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog...

[Verse 2]
What a great achievement it was
To find someone who shirks such little self-restraint
I'm a non-believer, but
I believe in these dirty little wicked games

Snakes and ladders are banned in here, love
The climb's too rough just to slide back down again
I'm only here because
I feel the day deserves a truly sordid end

[Chorus 2]
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your brains that splatter, not mine

We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog...

[Bridge]
I've made some bad decisions; I'll admit that freely
It's just that life tastes sweeter when it's wrapped in debauchery
So drop your map, drop your plans, drop that five-step program
Because there's not an ounce of faith in this leap

It's clear you feel nothing, so jump into the fog with me!
(Jump in, jump in, jump in)…

[Instrumental]

Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!"

1323,RunawaysThe Killers,"[Verse 1]
Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

[Verse 2]
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We can't wait til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

[Verse 3]
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other till the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

[Verse 4]
At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We can't wait till tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeah, runaways

Concerned about your whereabouts

All the world and the mess that we're making
Can't give up
And hope God will intercede
Come on back
Imagine that
We could get it together
Stand up
For what we need to be

Wait for a miracle to change things

One by one, could we just turn it around?
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer?

Just want to be free yeah yeah
But you see
All the world is just as we have made it
And until we've got a new world

Love is not a whisper or a weakness
No, love is strong
Now we got to get it together, yeah
Got to get, got to get, got to get
Until there is no reason
To fight

One by one, could we just turn it around?
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer?

A lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swinging
We are the ones still swinging
We are the ones still swinging"
1334,Queen Of CaliforniaJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame

I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Verse 2]
Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Electric country blues guitar bridge]

[Verse 3]
If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote ""Blue"" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Instrumental outro]"
1336,Standing In The SunSlash,"[Verse 1]
You're the dark to light
You're never satisfied
You only know the things that will fail to be
A pessimistic one
Who sees the end to come
Where every joy is lost to a tragedy
And still, you wonder why you cannot find your peace today
Because you were meant to live
So much more than this
Now if only you could see

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still, the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
There ain't a cloud in sight
Still, your heart beats cold and grey
Every day

[Verse 2]
You know it brings me down
The way you drag around
Your heavy heart just like a stone
Well, keep your misery
Don't put it all on me
Cause I've got problems of my own

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still, the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
So keep your cloud of darkness and doom off my parade
Yeah today

[Verse 3]
And if I could, you know I'd set off a spark
I would burn it out, I would burn it all away
If you're a fire jaded, cold calloused heart
Some day, I'll find a way

[Solo]

[Chorus]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still, the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
So keep your cloud of darkness and doom off my parade
Yeah today

[Outro]
You could be standing out in the Sun
Still, the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
Someday I'll steal the spark, I will burn your doubt away
I'll find a way"
1338,Top Of The WorldSlightly Stoopid,"[Verse 1: Miles]
So, when the music's stoppin'
There's no more knockin' or kickin down my door
Ain't no need for changin' or rearranging
The life we have endured
All these foolish ways, with these hopeless strays
Keep you comin' back for more
By the time you hear it, it's over, it's over
I really must have lost my mind
Wasn't me who wasn't hard to find
Six strings on my back, always lookin' for the next track
Thinkin' 'bout the old 'hood, always up to no good
When you gonna realize
That we livin' like we hypnotized?
By the sound that you hear when the music's over
Times runnin' out, can't you see it's for ya?

[Chorus: Kyle]
When you're down and out
Nobody open their mouth
No-one ever come around your way
When you're on top of the world
Every man and every girl wanna come and get some shit for free
When you're sittin' on the corner
No one's ever gonna pay you any mind, that day
You're just sittin' outside, gettin' colder

[Verse 2: Kyle]
Not long ago, when you wasn't that old
Now, look at you is old and gray
Like a piece of your mind that was stolen in time
Never listen what nobody says
The reason everyday is not a holiday
Because, the government, they steal your pay
Was a dream, but it's already over
Won't someone get us out of here?
I'm alive but I can't feel
Cannot tell what's reality
Cannot tell what is and isn't real

[Chorus]"
1339,We Come RunningYoungblood Hawke,"[Intro]
When come running
We come running
We come running
We come running

[Verse 1]
Under a pale blue sky
You never felt so cold
Another sleepless night
How could you ever let go?
How do you recognize
The dirty face of gold
Behind that crooked line
Where you never knew you'd go

[Chorus]
Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gonna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

[Verse 2]
When the worlds gone quiet (whoa)
I see you dancing slow (whoa)
Feeling satisfied
Where you never knew you'd go

[Chorus]
Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gonna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

Days go by
Feeling broke and tired
Remember
Always remember
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

1340,HeadlightsMorning Parade,"[Verse 1]
Late Like the evening sun, I
I sink to the ground
I'll keep my promises, I
I won't let you down

[Chorus]
'Cause like a rabbit in your headlights
I am the beckon to your call
And like the early morning headlines
I am all too predictable
Yeah, I'm all too predictable

(Oh oh oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
You're steady as I come undone, you
You're quietly bound
But I'll keep my promises, I
I won't let you down

[Chorus]

True like the first-born
Weighed pound for pound
I'll keep my promises like
A thorn in your crown
Yeah!

'Cause like a rabbit in your headlights
I am the beckon to your call
Just say ""jump"" I'll say ""How high?""
'Cause I'm all too predictable
Yeah I'm all to predictable"
1347,Lost In The EchoLinkin Park,"[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go

Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see

That I could never be held
Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell

There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?

I've seen that, frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back, unshaken
Let down and lived and let go

So, you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone

I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go!

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how

I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go
Go, go, go, go"
1351,Not With HasteMumford,"[Verse 1]
Your eyes they tie
Me down so hard
I'll never learn to put up a guard
So keep my love
My candle bright
Learn me hard, oh learn me right
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
Though I may speak
Some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength
From which to speak
When you sit me down, and see I'm weak

[Hook]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

[Verse 2]
So as we walked
Through fields of green
Was the fairest sun I'd ever seen
And I was broke
I was on my knees
But you said yes as I said please
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
I leave no ties
For a cynics mind

[Hook]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

[Verse 3]
Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste
As it keeps my heart and soul in it's place
And I will love with urgency but not with haste"
1352,Where Are You NowMumford,"[Verse 1]
We came to the end it seems you had heard
As we walked the city streets you never said a word
When we finally sat down your eyes were full of spite
I was desperate, I was weak, I could not put up a fight

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

[Verse 2]
You were strangely less in pain than you were cold
Triumphant in your mind of the logic that you hold
You said no one would ever know the love that we had shared
As I took my leave to go it was clear you didn't care

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

[Verse 3]
And I hear of your coming and your going in the town
I hear stories of your smile, I hear stories of your frown
And the darkness can descend we can relish all the pain
But I know that's what you love cause you know I love the same

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?"
1353,AngelsThe xx,"[Verse 1]
Light reflects from your shadow
It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room
Like breathing was easy
If someone believed me

[Chorus]
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
In love, love, love

[Verse 2]
And everyday
I am learning about you
The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels
And leaving without them
And leaving without them

[Chorus]
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 3]
And with words unspoken
A silent devotion
I know you know what I mean
And the end is unknown
But I think I'm ready
As long as you're with me

[Chorus]
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love with you as I am
Being
As in love, love, love"
1355,Doom And GloomThe Rolling Stones,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top

[Pre-Chorus]
What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

[Chorus]
When all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that light, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?

[Verse 2]
We lost all that treasure in an overseas war
Just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Bowing to the rich and you worry 'bout the poor
Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors

[Pre-Chorus]
What's that funky noise?
It's the tightening of their screws
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

[Chorus]
All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go
Boom, boom, boom
Through that night, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Yeah, baby, won't you dance with me?
Ah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking at the garbage dump
I'm running out of water, so I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober, but I end up drunk

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Gonna make your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt, yeah

[Chorus]
But all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that night, your face I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?

[Outro]
Yeah, come on
Baby won't you dance with me?
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Oh yeah, sitting in the dirt
Baby, won't you dance with me?"
1356,My Oh MyTristan Prettyman,"[Verse 1]
You got my heart on a string
You want me back again and you know I’ll do anything
Just when I thought I was free
Knock, knock, the door is locked
But you still got a key
All too familiar, the moment it shows up
Now everything I know seems to fly

[Chorus]
My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again
Here you are standing there
Tell me why I should try-y-y
My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y
My oh my-y-y

You got me under a spell
You look like heaven, oh, but you put me through hell
God knows there’s nothing to gain
Well who am I to deny, we’re both playing the same game
All too familiar, the moment it blows up
Now everything I know seems to fly

My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again
Here you are standing there

My oh my-y-y

And I know that you’re no good for me
And it makes no sense at all
Still I keep coming back for more
‘Cause I’m addicted to your call

I know you ain’t no good for me
And all the lies and the lines you fed to me
The way you kept coming back for me
Like the last breath left of the air I need

I know you ain’t no good for me
And all the lies and the lines you fed to me
The way you kept coming back for me
Like the last breath left of the air I need

[Chorus]
My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again
Here you are standing there

1357,Let Yourself GoGreen Day,"[Verse 1]
Shut your mouth cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a damn anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit
And all you really do is complain
It's your lie, tell it how you like
Small minds tend to think alike

Shut your mouth cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a fuck anyway

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go

[Verse 2]
Cut the crap cause you're screaming in my ear
And you're taking up all of the space
You're really testing my patience again
And I'd rather get punched in the face
You're getting on my very last nerve
Everything you said I've already heard

I'm sick to death of your every last breath
And I don't give a fuck anyway (SHUT THE FUCK UP!)

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

I hate you for the sacrifices you made for me
I hate you for every time you ever bled for me
I hate you for the way you smile when you look at me
I hate you for never taking control of me

I hate you for always saving me from myself
I hate you for always choosing me and not someone else
I hate you for always pulling me back from the edge
I hate you for every kind word you ever said

I love you for never delivering me from pain
I love you for always driving me insane

1361,Waiting For The EndLinkin Park,"[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
Holding on to what I haven't got
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear"
1362,Shake Me DownCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now? Softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

[Verse 2]
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down

[Chorus 1]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

[Verse 3]
Shake me down, cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound, softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

[Verse 4]
In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down

[Chorus 2]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now, it's time for me to let go
Way down, had to find a place to lay low
Lamp shade, turned around into a light post

[Bridge]
Walk around the corner, never saw it coming, still
I try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief
I don't want to know the future, I'm like Rolling Thunder
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day

[Chorus 3]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down, not a lot of people left around

Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
A little off guard and unprepared
I was never good enough to find
I was never bad enough to mind
In the middle I will do my best
Take me in your arms and leave the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you anything to

Little variations on my page
Little doors open on my cage
Little time has come and gone so far
Little by little who you are
I can see the patterns on your face
I can see the miracles I trace
Symmetry and shadows I can't hide
I just wanna be right by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you everything to

[Chorus 2]
Say you want to stay, you want me too
Say you'll never die, you'll always haunt me

Say you'll haunt me

Sing it out, boy, you've got to see what tomorrow brings
Sing it out, girl, you've got to be what tomorrow needs
For every time that they want to count you out
Use your voice every single time you open up your mouth

Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls

Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world

Sing it out, boy, they're going to sell what tomorrow means
Sing it out, girl, before they kill what tomorrow brings
You've got to make a choice if the music drowns you out
And raise your voice every single time they try and shut your mouth

Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart, sing it till you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world

Cleaned-up corporation progress, dying in the
Process, children that can talk about it, living on the
Web-ways, people moving sideways, tell it till your
Last days, buy yourself a motivation, generation
Nothing! Nothing but a dead scene, product of a
White dream, I am not the singer that you wanted, but a
Dancer, I refuse to answer, talk about the
Past, sir, wrote it for the ones who want to get away
Keep running!

[Chorus]
Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart, sing it till you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world

Got to see what tomorrow brings, sing it for the world

Nah-ah ,nah-ah
Now
I can feel the animal inside
My resolve is weakening
Pounding at the doors of my mind
It's nearly overpowering
I cannot begin to describe
The hunger that I feel again
Run if you intend to survive

[Bridge]
For the beast is coming to life
Taking form in the glimmer in this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

[Chorus 1]
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

[Verse 2]
I can hear it calling again
The primal need is filling me
Changes are about to begin
And now my blood is boiling
I can see the fear in your eyes
But you can't bring yourself to scream
Time to shed the mortal disguise

For the beast is coming to life
Taking form in the glimmer in this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

We begin the hunt and I
Feel the power course, as the creatures take flight
For the kill is close and I will be satisfied
For the smell of fear tonight
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied
You're mine

[Chorus 2]
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

[Chorus 3]
For the animal's soul is mine
And the world around will never hear your cries
An unholy crime
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight"

Happiness hit her, like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try

Preparing to unleash, let loose a mighty cry

Can nobody save us? Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning, the cypress has died
And all alone they're saying

The ocean floor explodes, eleven mothers cry
My bones all resonate a burning lullaby

Her words pierce the dark night, ""does anyone care?""
And all alone they're saying

Cause somebody will soon arrive

It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 2]
Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

I've got a new low
All 52 cards in a row
I see now that I won't let go
No, I won't let go
Well, who am I?
A cold shoulder left to cry
You feel bad, well so do I
Yeah so do I

[Chorus: Sean Stockham & Zack Lopez](X2)
I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up, but mostly down

[Verse 3: Sean Stockham]
I can not help feeling like
I have so much at stake
So I lock myself inside my head
And I just run in place
So many directions
I don't know which way to go
I'm so busy doing nothing
I got nothing to show

[Pre-Chorus: Zack Lopez]
I've got a new low
All 52 cards in a row
I see now that I won't let go
No, I won't let go
Well, who am I?
A cold shoulder used to cry
You feel bad, well so do I
Yeah so do I

[Chorus: Sean Stockham & Zack Lopez](X2)
I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down

[Verse 4: Sean Stockham]
I make mistakes
Just like everybody else
But instead of letting go of it
I can't forgive myself

[Verse 5: Zack Lopez]
Well I did my time
In the window-less box
Like it or not
All I got now is today
Tomorrow ain't here
And yesterday is gone dead on me anyway

[Chorus: Sean Stockham & Zack Lopez](X4)
I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up, but mostly down"
1383,Closer To The EdgeThirty Seconds To Mars,"[Verse 1]
I don't remember the moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, is it better not said
Now I'm closer to the edge

It was a thousand to one and a million to two
Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you
Closer to the edge

[Chorus]
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
(Can you, can you, can you, can you)
Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free?
The birth of a sun, the death of a dream
Closer to the edge

This never ending story
Paid for with pride and faith
We all fall short of glory
Lost in our fate

No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

1385,All I WantA Day To Remember,"[Verse 1]
I'm always screaming my lungs out 'til my head starts spinning
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
I'm constant like the seasons
And I will never be forgotten man

[Refrain]
Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

[Chorus]
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

[Verse 2]
Still got something left to prove
It tends to keep things movin' while everyone around me says
My last days are looming overhead
But just what the hell do they think they know?
I keep my head above the water, while they drown in the undertow

[Refrain]
Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

[Chorus]
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

[Bridge]
If you take it from me, live your life for yourself
Cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else
C'mon!

[Verse 3]
So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me was this all worth it?
I get what I want so everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

[Chorus]
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

[Outro]
Keep your heads down low, keep your heads down low
Keep your hopes up high, and your heads down low"

1387,Machine Gun BluesSocial Distortion,"[Verse 1]
Well I'm a gangster in 1934
Junkies, winos, pimps, and whores
And all you men, women and kids
Best stay out of the way
I just left your town
Took all your loot
Wore a pink carnation and a pinstripe suit
A hopped up V8 Ford, and some two-tone shoes

[Chorus]
And I'm already gone
I left a pool of blood and sorrow
I've got the machine gun blues

[Verse 2]
I'll be out of here before the break of dawn
Hit the highway, smoke a big cigar
Gonna stop and bury the cash
Then get some more
There's only one thing on my mind
That's makin' across that ol' state line
Amid a hail of avenging bullets
That are meant for me

[Chorus]
And I'm already gone
I left a path of pure destruction
I've got the machine gun blues
Already gone
My life will soon be through
I've got the machine gun blues

[Bridge]
I'm public enemy number one
I'm sorry for all the things that I've done
If indeed we do cross paths
It's nothing personal

And I'm already gone
I left a trail of devastation
I've got the machine gun blues
Already gone
My life will soon be through
I've got the machine gun blues"

And my strength is fading fast
You breathe into me at last

I've been here looking dynamite
Alone against the wall
Girls like you give it all so cold
Talking cheap in a bathroom stall
And you look so smooth
You better tell me the truth
Would you trade me
Out for someone cool?
I know you better than you do
So put out your cigarette
And kiss me on
The lips tonight

I've got something that I've kept inside
And the blood is on the blade

When your body's up against some fool
Does he feel it?
Cause I feel it

1390,HesitateStone Sour,"[Verse 1]
You - were my fire, so I burned
'Til there was nothing left of me
I - I touched your face, I held you close
'Til I could barely breathe
Why - give me hope, then give me up?
Just to be the death of me
Save the rest of me

'Cause I see you, but I can't feel you anymore
So go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore

1391,BurnPapa Roach,"[Verse 1]
I did not know you were a fake
Every lie straight to my face
So blind I could not see
Right behind my back you stabbed me
Should have know you were a bitch
Shut up you are making me sick
Little man you are nothing like me
Lying cheating so deceiving
I trusted you broke me down
And you screwed me over

Don't touch me, I don't wanna feel your skin
I know that you're only gonna hurt me
I hear you, I don't wanna do it again
Cause we both know this is not a passing trait!

[Pre-Chorus]
All along a failure to connect and to compromise
Right or wrong, it's easy to react
Time to realize

(No more!)

And you keep talking but we both know it's not true

And no matter what we both had to go through

So I try to be silent, but my words, they explode like hand grenades
I just gotta stay calm, before I let this time bomb blow up in my face

This life that I made

1394,When You're Young3 Doors Down,"[Verse 1]
So far away from knowing where I am going
I am trying hard to find out who I am
They all say that I don't know what I am doing
I say they don't hardly understand

[Hook]
Why can't they remember
What I'll never forget
How these dreams can come undone
When you're young

[Chorus]
You give what you give 'cause they make you
Trapped inside a place that won't take you
And they want you to be what they make you
It's already over and done
When you're young

Everything seems perfect (everything seems perfect)
Everything's OK (everything's OK)
It will all get better now (get better now)
At least that's what they say
But I don't see it coming

You give what you give cause they make you
Trapped inside a place that won't take you
And they want you to be what they make you

Days never seem longer
They say it's better this way
I hope one day I am stronger than I feel
And I hope that it feels different than today

Stop! The train is riding
Down to the station
Where you lived
When we were school kids

Hey! The rails are caught now
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral
Round this town of steel

My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more

My body tells me no
But I won't quit

The fallen embers burn
Down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves?

1398,Hear Me NowHollywood Undead,"[Verse 1: J-Dog]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out of my chest
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find
But maybe I won't because I left it all behind
Now I'm stuck with this, and that'll never change
Always a part of me until the very last day
Where to go from here? What road to travel on?
I spent my whole life choosing, and it always chose wrong
Will I try to have the will to be alive?
Will I try 'cause I've never seen the light?
Lowered to the ground, and it's now you see
You spent your whole life taking the best of me

[Chorus: Danny]
Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
How long can I keep pretending to be
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me?
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees
A man of many words but a man of few deeds
Walking these streets so absent of hope
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home
Lend him a hand, then we're walking away
Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame
So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight
When you wake up, you know, it's darker than last night
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life

[Chorus: Danny]
Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now

[Bridge: Danny]
Look into my eyes and I see, what do I see?
Nothing at all
Take another look around me, what do I see?
Nothing at all

[Chorus: Danny]
Where'd you go? Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground?
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now
Can you hear me, hear me now?"

Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna take you home
And watch the world explode
From underneath your glow

I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
Because you know my room
And then crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

And you played it to the beat

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

Throw your soul through every open door (oh-oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa-oh)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (oh-oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

We could have had it all

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"

1405,The Ghost InsideBroken Bells,"[Verse 1]
She sold her love to a modern man
Good solid currency’s the hardest to land
All of that money helps you cover your ass
Don't let the ladyfinger blow in your hands

[Chorus]
Did it all, for that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Verse 2]
Just like a whiskey bottle drained on the floor
She got no future, just a life to endure
This good samaritan is shaking her hand
Too late to leave here now, the songs in the can

[Chorus]
Give it up, for that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Verse 3]
You call it chivalry
Never pull a punch for free
You ever wonder why they had to move on
This phony honor code
That put you on your throne
A double-standard you invoke when you want

[Chorus]
For that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Outro]
Was it all for show?
Don't turn into one of them
Turning another page
Trust me darling
I'm carving a moat through the dust in your town
Crawling over the rubble
Just to serve you
Tend to wonder why"
1406,Louder Than EverCold War Kids,"[Verse 1]
All my windows were barred
The sun made stripes of shade
I was sitting 'round like a zombie
Feedin' my own face

[Verse 2]
I was carrying my cheek
I was digging my strange
I was taking you for granted
You were holding the reins

[Chorus]
But I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Now I can hear you louder than ever

[Verse 3]
It's a slippery slope
Like that mouse trap game
Inside my tunnel vision
You slept on my train

[Chorus]
But I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Now I can hear you louder than ever

[Bridge]
I don't want to ignore
You or the past or my feelings
We're probably gonna get out of this just
Hear me out anyway
The darkness snuck in
And now I'm doubtin' all my promises
Don't try to pull me out of this
Just lay down by me and wait

[Chorus]
'Cause I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Yeah I can hear you louder than ever

[Outro]
Now I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever"
1407,We Used To WaitArcade Fire,"[Verse 1]
I used to write
I used to write letters
I used to sign my name
I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
But by the time we met
By the time we met
The times had already changed
So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart
I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was left standing in the wilderness downtown

[Hook]
Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

[Verse 2]
And it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive
We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown

[Bridge]
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooooo we used to wait
Still moving through the pain

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna write a letter to my true love
I'm gonna sign my name
Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again
Gonna move through the pain

[Hook]
Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

[Bridge]
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooooo we used to wait
Still moving through the pain
We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait

[Outro]
We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming
Sing the chorus again
We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming
Sing the chorus again
I used to wait for it
I used to wait for it
Hear my voice screaming
Sing the chorus again

Wait for it!
Wait for it!!
Wait for it!!!"
1408,Born FreeKid Rock,"[Verse 1]
Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But, tell them if I don't survive

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 2]
Free, like a river raging
Strong as the wind I’m facing
Chasing dreams and racing father time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can’t see my heart you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can’t keep no chains on me

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 3]
And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Calm, facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Outro]
I will bow to the shining sea
And celebrate God's grace on thee"
1409,Under Cover Of DarknessThe Strokes,"[Verse 1]
Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

[Chorus]
And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

[Chorus]
And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

[Chrous]
I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning, yelling ""no more!""
So long my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you"
1410,PyroKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
Single book of matches, gonna burn what's standing in the way
Roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade
Bury all the pictures, and tell the kids that I'm okay
If I'm forgotten, they'll remember me for today

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on

[Verse 2]
All the black inside of me, is slowly seeping from the bone
Everything I cherish, is slowly dying or it's gone
Little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree
Once the show gets started it's bound to be a sight to see

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I

[Bridge]
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?

I, I don't wanna be here holding on (Watch her roll)
I (Can you feel it?)
I won't ever be your cornerstone

1411,Lost In YouThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
I always knew that you'd come back to get me
And you always knew that it wouldn't be easy
To go back to the start to see where it all began
Or end up at the bottom to watch how it all ends

[Pre-Chorus]
You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said I'm nothing without you
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you

[Verse 2]
You always thought that I left myself open
But you didn't know I was already broken
I told myself that it wouldn't be so bad
But pulling away you took everything I had

[Pre-Chorus]
You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said I'm nothing without you
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you, in you

[Bridge]
The pain of it all, the rise and the fall
I see it all in you
Now every day I find myself say
I want to get lost in you
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you (Somehow I found)

[Outro]
A way to get lost in you (A way to get lost in you)"
1413,Country BoyAaron Lewis,"[Verse 1: Aaron Lewis]
Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said, ""You wanna sell a million records, boy? You better listen to me""

[Bridge: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
He said, ""Change your style, whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?""

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
I said, ""no that's not me""
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis]
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive

[Verse 3: Aaron Lewis]
Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made
""Don't tread on me"" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Outro: Charlie Daniels]
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes, 'cause this is America, and a country boy is good enough for me, son"

I'm a rockstar, I'm a dealer
I'm a servant, I'm a leader
I'm a saviour, i'm a sinner, i'm a killer
I'll be anything you want me to be

Silent as a witness
Make your heart race with a death kiss
I'm a soldier in a blood war
In the peace corp I'll be everything you'll ever be

Loser number zero
Play the victim, end up a hero

Times collide watch the world awaken
All the past regrets from days gone by
Let it go, let it die

It's a new day for the faceless
Take the torches from the useless
First amendment, second guesses
All dependant, I'll do anything to help you

Fallen crosses, new alliance

Open guest list, all inclusive
No-one loses, everything you've always wanted

Honest answers for the bruises
Full disclosure, no excuses
Open handshake, clean slate
No hate, living history

Misery, information, revolution
Loading up for execution

You are me, I am you"
1421,ChangingThe Airborne Toxic Event,"[Verse 1]
All these buckets of rain
I've heard enough about
You say that I lie
I am a gentleman
Didn't I ask for a place I could stay?
What were we both thinking?
The next part just got in the way

[Hook 1]
You were just always talking about changing, changing
What if I was the same man, same man
The same I always was

[Verse 2]
All these things that you say
Like I'll forget about
The mind-numbing games that you play
I am a gentleman
Didn't I pay for every laugh every dime
Every bit every time?
And then you feed me some lie

[Hook 2]
I won't hear one more word about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man
Same man I've always been

[Bridge]
Days pass, turn into weeks
When we don't even speak
We just lay wide awake
And pretend we're asleep
And you go home alone
And you're checking your phone
And you're looking at me
Like I'm something you own

[Verse 3]
All these buckets of rain
You can't forget about
You say I never try
I am a gentleman
Didn't I answer every time that you called?
Pick you up when you fall?
But you never listen at all

[Extro]
You were just always talking about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man
Changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man
Changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man"

Been cheatin' gravity and waitin' on the fall
How did this come over me, I thought I was above it all?
Our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown

Well, I can't stand to look at you now
This revelation's out of my hands
Still, I can't bear the thought of you now
This complication's leaving me scared

Stay when you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey, keep your sickness off me

Well, I can't stand to be with myself

This sublimation's outta my hands

You stay cause you think you want me

Shame you could take this from me
Bane on an empty mind

Take what you want, but just leave me alive

This is the poison we take
Yeah
Outside the velvet rope
Standing there all alone
Are the grotesque and ashamed

Well if you think real beauty's on the outside
Well that's a far cry
From the truth
Maybe all the information you received
Well you should not believe
There's no proof

Save yourself from all the lies of the beautiful people
It's time to run from the lies of the beautiful people

Doped up and televised
Life can be cruel and insane

On our infected hearts
Maybe it's time for a change

Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser
Back on the mic, it's the anti-depressor
Ad-Rock--no pressure--yes, we need this
The best is yet to come and, yes, believe this
Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Sip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo
Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino
Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino
I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes, they age like wine as I get older
I'm getting bolder, competition is wanin'
I got the ball and I see the lane and

[Chorus]
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
Crazy, crazy, crazy

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]
Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection
I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a Fizzy-Lifting Drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just riffingAnd when I catch MCs, it's time for wing clipping
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
Cause I'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong

[Chorus]
We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
Crazy, crazy, crazy
The break is crazy
Crazy-crazy

[Verse 3: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]
Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say, ""That's my old self""
Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!)
The forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance
Parlay romancing into financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt

We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me"

I am now an instrument of violence
I am a vessel of invincibility
I cannot leave this undecided
Stepping down to battle another day

Remember me for all time
This determination is a vital part of me
Surrender now, or be counted
With the endless masses that I will defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on bring it, don't sing it
Better believe it

Broken down, 'til your hope has died
Beat down, 'til the victory is mine
Stand up and show me some pride
And now, are you ready?

I'm one with the warrior, inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield, tonight

As I look upon you
Through the warriors eyes, now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory, this time

[Verse 2]
I can't be told to compromise this
They'll never doubt the body lying at my feet
A most formidable reminder
They will speak my name for eternity

I have no need of any guidance
I am a weapon, powerful beyond belief
Seen through the warriors eyes
I never need to question how to defeat you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on bring it, don't sing it
Better believe it

Broken down, 'til your hope has died
Beat down, 'til the victory is mine
Stand up and show me some pride
And now, are you ready?

I'm one with the warrior, inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield, tonight

As I look upon you
Through the warriors eyes, now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory, this time

[Bridge]
You can't hide, now
I am the warrior
So decide, now
How they’ll remember you

Do not hide, now
Act like a warrior
Show your pride, now
Solidify your place in time

[Chorus]
I'm one with the warrior, inside
My dominance can’t be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield, tonight

As I look upon you
Through the warriors eyes, now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory, this time

I'm one with the warrior, inside
The evidence can't be denied
The entire world will stare
Into this battlefield, tonight

As I stand before you
With a warriors heart, now
I can feel the strength that will
Ensure my victory, this time"

So many people runnin'
Don't know where they're goin'
Panic and Panic and Panic

Never feared for anything
Never shamed but never free
A life that healed the broken heart with all that it could
Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart with all that I could

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

[Verse 2]
Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growin' old
It seems we're so invincible, the truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Where you can stay
You can stay awake forever

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned

The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
'Cause as soon as I'm done, I'll be on my way
To live eternally

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it’s so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you’re so far away

[Outro]
I love you, you were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you when He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied
So far away
And I need you to know
So far away
And I need you to, need you to know"

A lifetime of yesterdays

We're only young and naive still
We require certain skills
The mood it changes like the wind
Hard to control when it begins

[Chorus]
The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can't help myself but count the flaws
Claw my way out through these walls
One temporary escape
Feel it start to permeate

We lie beneath the stars at night
Our hands gripping each other tight
You keep my secrets hope to die
Promises, swear them to the sky

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

As it withers, brittle it shakes
Can you whisper, as it crumbles and breaks?
As you shiver, count up all your mistakes
Pair of forgivers, let go before it's too late
Can you whisper? Can you whisper?
Can you whisper? Can you whisper?

1436,Ghost Of Days Gone ByAlter Bridge,"[Verse 1]
The misery I know
Like a friend that won't let go
Is creeping up on me now once again
So I sing this song tonight
To the ghost that will not die
And somehow it seems to haunt me till the end

[Chorus]
Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the ghost of days gone by

[Verse 2]
I remember summer days
We were young and unafraid
With innocence we'd glide beneath the stars
It seems so long ago
Beyond the life that I now know
Before the years would have their way and break my heart

[Chorus]
Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the ghost of days gone by

And I know it's drawing closer
With each day I feel the end
I... don't wanna die
Don't wanna die, don't wanna die

I don't wanna die

Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the days gone by
Do they haunt you like a ghost until the end

Haunt you 'til the end
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end"
1437,IridescentLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When you were standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying, ""Save me now""
You were there, impossibly alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration

1438,LowlifeTheory Of A Deadman,"[Verse 1]
You know I'll be the one who gets falling down drunk
At my neighbor kid's soccer game
I've got an '82 Fiero with a car seat in the middle
Broken down on the interstate
I've got a beer-stained t-shirt, looking like Joe Dirt
Something 'bout me just ain't right
I'm a cash-stealing, drug-dealing loser without any feeling
Getting trailer trashed tonight

[Chorus]
'cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm loving it
I've got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
No, you can't change something that you don't understand

[Verse 2]
I'm thrilled to be a hillbilly, hate to have to deal with me
Probably just end in a fight
No sleeves, can't read, doesn't even phase me
Naked, sleeping like a baby tonight

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Living it up, living it up
Being a lowlife

[Verse 3]
A gun-packing, bitch-smacking, mess with me, it's gonna happen
Loving life, living in sin
Passed out, on the floor, sorry, just don't work no more
Giving up on giving in
Ah, fuck it!

[Chorus 2]
Cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm lovin' it
I'm never gonna change as long as I live
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
Cause deep down I really know everyone is

Living it up, living it up
Being a low life"

And no one knows what to do
Pieces of the puzzle don't fit
So I pound them into you

Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping out to come alive

Times are looking grim these days!
Holding on to everything!

Tortured by my memories

Holding on to everything!

I'm living life with no regrets
They're on their way buy ain't here yet
I just left Las Vegas in bad, bad shape
I only call home if I get the chance
Every other night a new romance
Wake up just in time to miss the day
And now I'm talking to the man in the mirror
And I think I heard him say

And I'm still closing down these streets
I'm high enough to make believe

If I'm alive or plan to settle down
Well, I called her drunk last night
And I think I heard her say

Getting louder every night

Digital, did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
Digital, did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?

Because there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye

Been raised by the surroundings of a home so cold, so cold

A gift from father to his only son
Watching over me with eagle eyes

She paints her fingers with a close precision

Assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again

Taste of what you paid for

After I died, and the makeup had dried, I went back to my place
No moon that night, but a heavenly light shone on my face
Still I thought it was odd, there was no sign of God just to usher me in

Whoa, there's a girl over there, with the sunshiny hair, like a homecoming queen
I said, ""Hey, what you say? It's a glorious day, by the way how long you been dead?""
Maybe you, maybe me, maybe baby makes three, but she just shook her head

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Buddha and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat
Had to stand in the line, just to glimpse the divine, what you think about that?
Well it seems like our fate to suffer and wait for the knowledge we seek
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line, no one here likes a sneak

[Chorus]

[Outro]
After you climb, up the ladder of time, the Lord God is near
Face to face, in the vastness of space, your words disappear
And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love, and the current is strong
But all that remains when you try to explain is a fragment of song
Lord is it, Be Bop A Lu La or Ooh Poppa Do
Lord, Be Bop A Lu La or Ooh Poppa Do
Be Bop A Lu La"
1453,Every Teardrop Is A WaterfallColdplay,"[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

[Outro]
Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
A wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall"

I don't know why I got these feelings, yeah
I just can't seem to get away from
Can you dig it?
You will never see it
No, you won't find it falling off my tongue
I take it downtown, finally lose it

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night, you
Got me tangled like a braid, tie-twisted
I don't think it's fair

[Refrain]
Do you?
You

[Verse 2]
Out here on the flip side
You know I took the long way round
Cause all I really am is a homemade elevator
Blinded by your sunshine
Put you on a plane to Parí
Lay my cards down on the table

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair

[Bridge]
Can't find a reason for these feeling
Clouding up above me
This guy, he told me
Said he's gonna send me something lovely
But even still, at times I wonder
What you're thinking of me
You're probably sure I lost my mind
Oh, mind, oh, mind, oh, mind, oh, mind

[Chorus]
I don't think it's very nice to
Walk around my head all night, you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair
I don't think it's very polite to
Walk around my head all night, you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair

Woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Bang bang go the coffin nails
Like a breath exhaled, then gone forever
It seems like just yesterday
How did I miss the red flags raised?
Think back to the days we laughed
We braved these bitter storms together
Brought to his knees he cried
But on his feet he died
What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?
What God could?

[Chorus]
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

[Verse 2]
Bang bang from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls, the shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking, I demand
From the nation under God
I feel its love like a cattle prod
Born free but still, they hate
Born me, no I can't change
It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me, let's prove them wrong

[Chorus]
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah


[Verse 3]
The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
The gatherings hold candles, but not their tongues
And too much blood has flown from the wrists
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood?
We're calling for, insisting on
A different beat, yeah
A brand new song

Tyler Clementi, age 18
Billy Lucas, age 15
Harrison Chase Brown, age 15
Cody J. Barker, age 17
Seth Walsh, age 13

[Chorus]
Make it stop, let this end
This life chose me, I’m not lost in sin
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living
Make it stop, let this end
All these years pushed to the ledge
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living"

She, she ain't real

You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds

[Verse 2]
She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Bless your soul)
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And boy, you're bringing me down

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear

People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

1458,What You KnowTwo Door Cinema Club,"[Verse 1]
In a few weeks, I will get time
To realise it's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
I am leaving and this is starting
To feel like it's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

[Verse 2]
Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you
Could have obtained, why try anything?
I will get there; just remember, I know

And I can tell just what you want

1460,Roll Away Your StoneMumford,"[Verse 1]
Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
And together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside
See you told me that I would find a hole
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals

[Chorus]
""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

[Verse 2]
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But, you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home
That will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with the restart

[Chorus]
""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

[Bridge]
Stars, hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so, I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul

But you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine

1461,MonsterParamore,"[Verse 1]
You were my conscience
So solid, now you're like water
And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any farther

But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

[Hook]
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours

I'm only human
I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain
Despite what you're always preaching

They're getting stronger
And I hear them calling

Calling (calling)

But I like the tension
And not always knowing the answers
But you're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose it

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Now that you're gone, the world...

From turning into a monster and eating us alive

Paint a picture so bright

Watch these hands move apart

All these things about me you never can tell

Just one last time and I'm gone
Keep telling myself that it's under control
And that's a lie I damn well know

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll return to the scene of the crime
And I'll gather my pride
Still I know you'll be long gone
Gnaws and turns as the fear builds inside
Seems much stronger than I
Still I know you're gone

The day that you told me
I won't be there I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time

I guess you helped make me strong
And when I think of what you put me through
It's better that we moved on

And I'll close this chapter move on
Soon I'll be long gone
And I walk away
And I walk away from

Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time

Baby could I be the rabbit in your hat?

Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start

Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night

Everyone's cross to bears the crown they wear on endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day

Let me get this straight, do you want me here?

Or how I'm just another fucking sheep in the herd?

Selling my soul and changing my name
Did you hear the one about me being a prick?

1480,BreakThree Days Grace,"[Verse 1]
Tonight, my head is spinning
I need something to pick me up
I’ve tried, but nothing is working
I won’t stop, I won’t say I’ve had enough

Tonight, I start the fire
Tonight, I break away

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

At night I feel like a vampire
It’s not right but I just can’t give it up
I’ll try to get myself higher
Let’s go, we’re going to light it up

1481,I Will Not BowBreaking Benjamin,"[Intro]
Fall

[Verse 1]
Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath, it's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover
I don't want to change the world
I just want to leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere
All is lost again, but I'm not giving in

[Chorus]
I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade
I will take your breath away

Fall

[Verse 2]
Watch the end through dying eyes
Now the dark is taking over
Show me where forever dies
Take the fall and run to heaven
All is lost again, but I'm not giving in

[Chorus]
I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive, paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud, cold blooded fate
I will shut the world away

I will not!

[Chorus]
I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive, paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud, cold blooded fate
I will shut the world away

1482,UprisingMuse,"[Verse 1]
Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

[Chorus]
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

[Verse 2]
Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious

Hey, hey, hey, hey

They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious

1483,(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You ToWeezer,"[Verse 1]
The moon was shining on the lake at night
The Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara
I looked into your eyes and saw a light

[Verse 2]
You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn’t like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the conversation stopped
And I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
Then I said

[Chorus]
Girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
So make the move (make the move)
Cause I ain’t got all night

[Verse 3]
The rest of the summer was the best we’ve ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn’t make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad

[Verse 4]
Your mom cooked meatloaf, even though I don’t eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you
And you were right there next to me
And I said

[Chorus]
Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
I swear it's true
Without you, my heart is blue

[Bridge]
So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops and we’re facing our defeat
I’ll be next to you and you’ll be right there next to me
Then I’ll say

Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
I swear it's true
Without you, my heart is blue"

If you only knew
I'm hanging by a thread, the web I spin for you
If you only knew
I'd sacrifice my beating heart before I'd lose you
I still hold onto the letters
You returned, I swear I've lived and learned

[Chorus]
It's 4:03 and I can't sleep
Without you next to me I toss and turn like the sea
If I drown tonight, bring me back to life
Breathe your breath in me
The only thing that I still believe in is you
If you only knew

[Verse 2]
If you only knew
How many times I counted all the words that went wrong
If you only knew
How I refuse to let you go even when you're gone
I don't regret any days I spent
Nights we shared, or letters that I sent

[Chorus]
It's 4:03 and I can't sleep
Without you next to me I toss and turn like the sea
If I drown tonight, bring me back to life

Into the night
Desperate and broken
The sound of a fight
Father has spoken

We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell
Heaven and hell

Into your eyes
Hopeless and taken

1488,SaviorRise Against,"[Verse 1]
It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

[Verse 2]
There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me now
If this ain't love
Then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

[Chorus]
That's when she said
""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save.""
That's when I told her
""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have.""

[Verse 3]
And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days
That deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand
Now do you understand?

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me now
If this ain't love
Then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

[Chorus]
That's when she said
""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save.""
That's when I told her
""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have.""

[Bridge]
One thousand miles away
There's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice
This world is too much noise
It takes me under
It takes me under once again

I don't hate you
I don't hate you, no

So tell me now
If this ain't love

Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present, they don't matter, now the future's sorted out
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns
Think it's not what you say, what you say is way too complicated
For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out

[Chorus]
It's twenty seconds 'til the last call
You're going, ""Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey""
Lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it over summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going, ""Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey""

And no, I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Girlfriend, oh, your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present, 1855-1901
Watch them built up a material tower
Think it's not going to stay anyway, think it's overrated

Define your meanin' of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up, out of control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know

[Hook]
It's been a long time comin'
And the tables turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

Define your meanin' of fun
Is it fuckin', druggin' or guns?
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one
Let's take a trip down memory lane
The words circlin' in my brain
You can treat this like another all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

It's been a long time comin'
And the tables turned around

This is hardly worth fightin' for
But it's the little petty shit that I can't ignore
When my fist hits your face and your face hits the floor
It'll be a long time comin'
But you got the message now
'Cause I was never goin'
Yeah, you're the one that's goin' down

New fang, no thing, had it made
To parade, found a sucker, now I want another
Stand up, step aside, open wide
Hanging out another 'til the feeling's gone
Want to? Yes, I do
Found a love, taking turns getting carpet burns
Loose lips, lipstick spit
Come and go, I think it's both, I gotta know

Sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
Think you've got me confused for a better man
Sometimes you break your finger on the upper hand
Said you've got me confused, oh

No slack, Cadillac, couldn't quit
Gums flap so here's your teeth back
Accept what I left
Far behind in a time when my mind was like a landmine
Tailgate by the lake
Too much, too young, every button gonna come undone
Tightrope, no joke
Nothing left so you go baroque

Said you got me confused with a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

[Chorus 1]
So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

[Verse 2]
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

[Chorus 2]
So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

[Guitar solo]

Oh, oh

[Chorus 3]
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago

If you still care, don't ever let me know

Tonight, I'll have a look and try to find my face again
Buried beneath this house, my spirit screams and dies again
Out back, a monster wears a cloak of Persian leather
Behind the TV screen, I've fallen to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

Blanket of silence makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
Burn all the evidence of fabricated disbelief
Pull back the curtains, took a look into your eyes
My tongue has now become a platform for your lies

I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday

Chained down, like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall

Deep in the jungle, camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
A hand holds up the sky while, shamefully, I make my plea
The altar's calling, but my legs won't seem to stand
Guess I'm a coward scared to face the man I am

I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away

I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday

I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

[Bridge]
In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between

Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
And only surrender will help you now
I love you, please see and believe again

[Verse 2]
I love that you're never satisfied
With face value, wisdom and happy lies
You take what they say and go back and cry
You're so close to me that you nearly died, oh

[Chorus]
Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
And only surrender will help you now
I love you, please see and believe again

[Bridge]
They don't have to understand you, be still
Wait and know I understand you, be still, be still

[Breakdown]
Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
And only surrender will help you now
The floodgates are breaking and pouring out

[Chorus 2]
Here you are down on your knees (Oh)
Trying to find air to breathe (Oh)
Right where I want to you to be again
I love you, please see and believe again

[Outro]
Here you are down on your knees again (Oh)
Trying to find air to breathe again (Oh)
Right where I want you to be again
See and believe"

Time to change has come and gone
Watched your fears become your God
It's your decision
It's your decision
Overwhelmed, you chose to run
Apathetic to the stunned
It's your decision
It's your decision

[Chorus]
You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lie
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside
No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say ""It's over, It's over""

Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peek
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand

[Chorus]
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends

[Verse 2]
Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst
Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand

[Chorus]
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends

A window, an opened tomb
The sun crawls across your bedroom
A halo, a waiting room
Your last breath's moving through you

1504,MonsterSkillet,"[Verse 1]
The secret side of me I never let you see
I keep it caged but I can't control it
So stay away from me, the beast is ugly
I feel the rage and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls
It comes awake and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

[Verse 2]
My secret side I keep hid under lock and key
I keep it caged but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out, he'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end!

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

[Bridge]
It's hiding in the dark, its teeth are razor sharp
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream, maybe it's just a dream
Or maybe it's inside of me, stop this monster

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I’m gonna lose control, it’s something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster"

1507,CrashCavo,"[Verse 1]
You're a beautiful wreck, now you're out of control
Crossing the double lines
You're a perfect disaster, the road to catastrophe
You don't stop for the signs
Heartbreak waiting to happen
Headlights cut through the rain
Tears hit the windshield
And I can't look away

[Chorus]
Every mile gets you further away from the past
Feels like you're shattered and covered in broken glass
I'll be here at the end the next time that you crash
Light it up

Time turns to rust and it's hard for you to trust
Every turn, every shoulder you feel
But I'm right here when it's just too much
You can let me take the wheel
Heartbreak waiting to happen

Every mile gets you further away from the past
Feels like you're shattered and covered in broken glass
And I'll be here the next time that you crash

I'll be here the next time that you crash
I'm right here in front of you
Just ask and I'll hold your breath in my hands
And I'll save you when you crash
When you crash

Every mile gets you further away from the past
Feels like you're shattered and covered in broken glass
Losing control, can't you see that you're running too fast?
And I'll be here the next time
I'll pick you up the next time you crash"

Reberu rajio!
¡La última noche!
And we will see how Godless a nation we have become
Em tset t'nod

[Verse 1]
Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized, well

(Stand up!) All the white boys
(Sit down!) And the black girls
(Stand up!) You're the soldiers
(Sit down!) Of the new world

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your faith in a miracle
And it's non-denominational
Join the choir, we'll be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

[Chorus]
A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

[Verse 2]
Oh, bless me, Lord, for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in ""the river of a shadow of doubt""
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best

[Pre-Chorus]
Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a goddamn thing!

[Chorus]
A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

[Bridge]
Don't test me
Second-guess me
Protest me
You will disappear

I want to know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
Missionary politicians
And the cops of the new religion

A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside

1510,Letter From A ThiefChevelle,"[Chorus 1]
They know what everybody knows
Better sit a letter from a thief says
Why lead when everybody sleeps
So few ways to

Cover up your wounds
Lost in a finger forced to lie
This sends us medicating
Through it all

[Chorus]
If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there

[Verse 2]
Faceless, so little there to judge
Left wing let's separate the cold out
Opposites, we never need to tell
One sting I've found I'm having to, having to

[Chorus]
If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there

[Bridge]
Solitude, waste of a man
This fades as soon as the sun sets

I now own this fatal role that lives
Imagine here's a better feel
Told to dissolve, or choose to fade
Or stay here you'll live

[Chorus x2]
If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there"
1511,Shakin' HandsNickelback,"[Verse 1]
(Hey, hey)
She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
You grow up quick when you grow up poor
It's the only way to LA that she knows
The Hollywood pose: teeth, tits, and toes
It didn't take her long to leave the boulevard
So many Five Star friends with black credit cards
She'd try anything once
'Cause anything goes
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold

[Chorus]
(Hey, hey)
Well, she ain't no Cinderella
When she's getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands

[Verse 2]
(Hey, hey)
I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
City Hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look
Every A-List player is her favorite friend
Since they all taste the same in the back of the Benz
A congressman would call her every once in a while
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
She'd done everyone once and everyone knows
You gotta get a little dirty when you're digging for gold
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Well, she ain't no Cinderella
When she's getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands

[Bridge]
Well, someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest
Yeah, he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west

[Chorus]
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands"
1512,SubstitutionSilversun Pickups,"[Verse 1]
There's a vulture perching right off screen
And it's bitter and whispers chaotic things
And the weeps turn quick into bullying
It's so easy to see, everyone can agree, stop listening

[Chorus]
I know you've heard it before
But then it wasn't enough
You don't wanna be held back from the substitution
I know you've seen this before
And now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
You're a marionette in the center of
The twisting strings coming from above
It may seem too deep to recover from
It's so easy to see, everyone can agree, just let it go

[Chorus]
I know you've heard it before
But then it wasn't enough
You don't wanna be held back from the substitution
I know you've seen this before
And now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Bridge]
When the voices start spinning, just be aware
I have brought enough stones for us to share
That one's grinning, that one's burning aim for the throat
Let 'em choke on the stones that we are to throw

It's the great downfall
The big overthrow
If you shoot them down
It'll make you soar

[Verse 3]
When reactions turn into hurricanes
And the middle ground seems a little tame
Whether full or empty it's all the same
It's so easy to see, everyone can agree, you're not to blame

[Chorus]
I know you've heard it before
But then it wasn't enough
You don't wanna be held back from the substitution
I know you've seen this before
But now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry"

On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you

In every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

I want the world to see you be, with me

From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history

What's come over me (come over me)
I can't explain
Why it's so hard for me, so hard to see your side

[Verse 2]
Projecting all my anger
I can't seem to get this through to you
The walls they're closing in
I dare you to walk in my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't explain
What's come over me (come over me)
I can't explain
Why it's so hard for me, so hard to see your side

[Bridge]
Your side
I won't see your side

[Chorus]
I can't explain
What's come over me (come over me)
I can't explain
Why it's so hard for me, so hard to see your
I can't explain
What's come over me (come over me)
I can't explain
Why it's so hard for me, so hard to see your side

[Outro]
I won't see your
Your side"
1525,FirefliesOwl City,"[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus (Extended)]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"
1526,Walk AwayFive Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for the demon I've become
You should be sorry for the angel you are not
I apologize for cruel things that I did
But I don't regret one single word I said

[Chorus]
Just walk away make it easy on yourself
Just walk away please release me from this hell
Just walk away there's just nothing left to feel
Just walk away pretend that none of this is real

[Verse 2]
Could you forgive me if I told you that I cared
Would you be sorry if I swore that I'd be there
Please forgive me for laughing when you'd fall
I'm so sorry but I never cared at all

[Chorus]
Just walk away make it easy on yourself
Just walk away please release me from this hell
Just walk away there's just nothing left to feel
Just walk away pretend that none of this is real

[Chorus]
Just walk away make it easy on us both
Just walk away there was never any hope
Just walk away you already know the deal
Just walk away pretend that none of this was
None of this was real"
1527,CrawlKings Of Leon,"[Verse 1]
You fault my pride
Don't ever need to 'pologize
As your lips unfold
Shaken purple from the cold

[Chorus]
You better learn to crawl
You better learn to crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away

[Verse 2]
You broke my mouth
The bloody bits are spitting out
Is your grave unscathed
The worm is counting down the days

[Chorus]
He wants to see you crawl
He wants to see you crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away

[Post-Chorus]
The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As their hypocrisy unfolds
Oh hell is truly on its way

[Verse 3]
As the rat, and the fly
They're searching for an alibi
As we await the wrath
They never went to Sunday Mass

[Chorus]
They want to see us crawl
They want to see us crawl
Before they walk away
Before they walk away

[Post-Chorus]
The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As their hypocrisy unfolds
Oh hell is truly on its way"
1528,Shake It OutManchester Orchestra,"[Verse 1]
Shake it out, shake it out
God, I need another and another
And another and another, I can feel it now
I felt the Lord in my father's house
And I can see, I can see
Standing, we were seventeen, make it clean
Are you the living ghost of what I need?
Are you gonna get the best of me?
We will see

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm done being done
With the funerals, at least for now
Are you tired of being alone?
Are you tired of being alone?

[Verse 2]
Shake it out, shake it out
Tired of another and another
Wasn't really what I wanted
So we bled it out
Over the floor of my neighbor's house
And I could see, I could see
God, I've never seen a thing so complete
I am the living ghost of what you need
I am everything eternally, God, just speak

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm done being done
With the funerals, at least for now
Are you tired of being alone?
Are you tired of being alone?
So speak to me

[Chorus]
Oh god, you gotta shake it out, shake it out
You gotta take it out, take it down
I gotta come around, I need it now more than I ever have
Oh god, you gotta shake it out, shake it out
You gotta break it down, break it out
You've gotta come around, I feel it now more than I ever have

[Bridge]
I felt the Lord begin
To peel off all my skin
And I felt the weight within
Reveal a bigger mess
That you can't fix

[Verse 3]
I swear, I swear I'll go
Lead me into my home
Don't stop, don't ever go
I swear you'll never know
You'll never know

[Chorus]
Oh god, you gotta shake it out, shake it out
You gotta break it down, break it out"
1530,ResistanceMuse,"[Verse 1]
Is our secret safe tonight?
And are we out of sight?
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place?
Is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?

[Hook]
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control

It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

[Chorus]
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

[Verse 2]
If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again
Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can't hide the truth inside

[Hook]
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control

It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

[Chorus]
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

[Outro]
The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
It's time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm
Resistance"
1531,Give Me A Sign (Forever And Ever)Breaking Benjamin,"[Part I]

[Intro]
Please, this shit's so fucking hard
([?]) Yeah, aye, aye

[Verse 1]
30,000 words in a rap, that's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track
Yeah, I've been searching the map for, like, any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast, I'm the only one out here, and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat, it gets turned into ash, if I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash
Aye, hold up, wait, when I'm on the track, I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like 30,000 hours, fuck 30,000 words, I don't slow my breaks
I go UK, then I make so many pounds, everybody think I'm overweight
Getting bread, see me eatin', but I gotta go in, better hold my plate
Ooo, ooo, gotta switch up, I'm so godly, I'm the bishop
Now these haters wanna link up, my bars make them get the hiccups
So I had to run it up real quick, freestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big 'cause I gotta get a [?], this real lit, real shit
Nowadays they write me, and I don't write it back, see my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath
Swear I'm driving down the road and I might've crashed, do the dash, always moving, don't know where to find me at
Hey, movin' on, gotta find a team, earnin' all the stripes like [?] but I'm lima beans
All these drivers about to get fucked like they Riley Reid, [?] teachers are requiring I am assigning seats
Pioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson, I was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn
All these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin, until I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant
Yeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up, yeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hundred bucks
At the start, all I wanted was like 30,000 hits, got bored, add a couple zero's for the shits
Why not? Look what I got, look what I bought, camera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause
Shoes, they go too high, only high-tops, fuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?
Come in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon, boy I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on
Too lit, I don't even have the mic on, and I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on
Better wait up, shit's too easy, like a layup
And my bitch too entertainin', see the note, you gotta stay up
Taking bets on that I'll fail, It's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face, I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits to get a world records, who's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?
Well maybe not, but I tried, though, Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino, 'cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow, turned my L's into W's, typo
Uh, hop into the track, give you the love and you give it right back
10 different flows I'd be spitting, some trap and some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for, like, a year, and now, my writing's clear, I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say, ""I'm not here to play""?
""He got a flow and a voice now, I remember when he choking a boy out
But he's back in showin' no choice now, don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?""
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how, cut his beat, I'll be blaring  'em so loud
We'll be talk about bitches and money, this shit be so funny, my parents are so proud, damn
I'm starting to try, trying the shots at it, look at the grind and see stars on the sky
Drawing the line, all of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high, if you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copying guys, you better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
30,000 words on a track, little bitch, now these people turn my vid' on and react, little bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, little bitch, and you giving me a headache, where the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doing all I can, and I did it in the past-tense, making all this money up off of YouTube off [?] AdSense
Money up off of YouTube off AdSense, all of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop, Eminem holds the world record for Rap God
1.6K words, though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour, and I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, all of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters, and they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done, 'cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top, and we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months, then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eating in this bitch, uh, y'all better, take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit, 'cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it, that subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat, I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap, old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as an intro, now, we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see coming, I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!

[Part II]

[Intro]
Heh, aye!
Aye, aye
Uh, switch up
Yeah, aye, aye, aye

[Verse 2]
Look out the window, see past it, but we're fainting reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You heading down the wrong path and they changing directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessing
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stopping these conversations
Hey, how long you waiting till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplating and stop complaining
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place, but you still vibing that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We heading on to new platforms and leaving the basics

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playing lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing going
I've been watching all these shows while I could be showing
I've been- creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changing them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't- even comprehend that much in the future
Hating the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fucking intruder
Stealing all these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinating 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser

[Verse 4]
Sittin' alone at 3:00 a.m
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, ""I must behave, Ben""
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this rock and I'm rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
It's obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test this system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain I just alleviated
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
Givin' dignity cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind

[Hook 1]
And I'm in time
But I keep on workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb

[Verse 5]
Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this 10-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, ""Bye"", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline

[Interlude 1]
Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been 11 minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter

[Verse 6]
How can I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury, nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different, I mean, it's all seeming to be, and it's in inconceivable dreaming?
I know it's so unbelievable, being stuck in this real unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving, they givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing what life could be like on the different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone so I know when and where to cross it
All over the place, I'm surprised I haven't lost it, aye, yeah

[Hook 2]
And I'm feeling like I'm at the top
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm standing up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage
Take the trash out, but I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout

[Verse 7]
Okay, it's time to go fast, so sit back and relax, and then just maybe you'll get it
About to, but you mad and say it, you gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second, I have some lyrics in the past, but I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track [?], mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit, want you to come back and pass a message
Never pack bags and trash, you left it, kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it, if I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it, think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it, if this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this, force is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else, people want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to live out my endeavors, still'd be better than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh

[Hook 3]
And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down
More focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds

[Verse 8]
Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People tell me that I'm falling short, looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that, I'm.. not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-teasin' rapper, but I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find, lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life, I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions, so much knowledge, I can't use some lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession, I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it, I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are ugly fools, but they just don't understand that I'm through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improving it, I got my brain, and I'm using it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playing and taking and making this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless, 90% of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds are so limited, get off your higher-ass 'cause now it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now, success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now, I'ma get to it, that is what living's about

[Interlude 2]
Uh, God
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 9]
Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, ""Reach for the skies""
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I've seen through its lies
I'm just tryin' to tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryin' to sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, ""Why?""
So I can summarize my life through my breathing inside
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried, yeah
Hopped in this life and I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, yeah
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A
I'm screamin', ""Hi"", to the sky with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All the steps that I have taken to find my place
Swept out to ocean, so lonely waves feel like an embrace
Now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality would ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)
And as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
Now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', ""I got that paper on me""
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They think cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm an awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Throughout half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like an active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, yeah
I swear the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove, so they know that it's real
30 seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, this a motherfucking thesis statement
Came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with somethin' to leave
So when I wake up every day with someone to be, damn

[Verse 10]
Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous, and
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So- when people say you can't, that makes you wanna' get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna' find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful at the very least

[Verse 11]
Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping, block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so, obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous
When they don't understand that I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

[Verse 12]
Gotta re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna' show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna' win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control, option, delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Wanna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet, but-
But time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna' show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna' show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so.. maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, I've
Got a lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please, let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
I just try to combine everything into this compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in, but-
When I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna' blow up, bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck- so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn

[Interlude 3]
Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this 30,000 words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it

[Verse 13]
My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever, okay, okay
I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watching this, take a drink too
These are some shit that you can drink to

[Interlude 3]
But drink water
Unless you're of age, you know what I'm saying? Aye
Okay, okay
Uh
Uh

[Verse 14]
I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
And most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
Uh, but still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this, is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find a great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink, or in a cup
Or in some bling, or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much

[Verse 15]
I'm so Jong and Ill, like the dictator
What I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like 10 years old
But still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go
And I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow
And I may be [?], but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic
And I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in success [?] inside
I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
You set on the wrong, forgetting the right
Like, 2:00 a.m. in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, [?] in the [?]
Go off to bed in the night
I'm getting it like I be livin' in first class
I know that you never will surpass
I'm getting the worst task for this burnt cash
Whenever I work fast
Remember the memos, and sendin'-and sendin' again
And again and again and it never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented
And every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying
You really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars
With meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars
But you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit
Crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
Singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen
And makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way
Y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other 14 year old
Is at 100K?
I'm- making the most of a crazier flow
So many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home
I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it
Even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it
Leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich
Reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've [?], they so now they're receiving it
Agreeing to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope
I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate
I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause- I am on top of it
Lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant
Positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck
Though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts
And I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage
Flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it
But really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin'
I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something
Called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
I'm gettin' better, that don't hurt
And you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher
Slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love
Call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough
And I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success
And I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
This chart is like a parabola
Thank you, Lord, for havin' up
And so, every day, I take one step up
Man, I am takin' the ladder up
A hundred-thousand, we get the plaque
Lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that
We ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you done whining
I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining
All my skills into one finding
We run rhymes, you know we do
We got the shit that we're going through
These lyrics go over you
You don't miss 'em, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it
Thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac
And Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers
Shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me
When all of the others abandon me
Drama, we move past that
I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast
So many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly
Now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I-
Never an-ticipated where there would be
And seeya', so long now
Off to the end of the song now
See ya' next [?] 500 and a million
It's on now

[Interlude 4]
It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, aye

[Hook 4]
When I walk up in the scene, I hear an orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
Aye, I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but God damn, I got the formula , aye
People always asking Ben, ""Why you record so much?""
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up

[Verse 16]
Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, aye
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Aye, still saying, ""Who woulda thought?"", like, who would of guessed it, huh?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook

[Verse 17]
Aye, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, ""No,"" and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, ""Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?""
I don't get it, I don't really understand, I've been living like
""Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams
Do I really wanna stand next to all these average fucking sad duds?""
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one

[Hook 5]
Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Aye
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he

[Verse 18]
'Cause he's been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making 'u'-minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I need to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one

[Verse 19]
By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserves some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I taking a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well we nearing 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

[Interlude 5]
That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago before I recorded this
Aye, aye
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh

[Hook 6]
Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, aye

[Verse 20]
Uh, wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that one day you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never
I think I'm so clever, but in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a- go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get As, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Damn... but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique, and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, ""OMG, relatable!""
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting- years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money, and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it

[Interlude 6]
Okay
Okay, okay
We're like 30 minutes in, 30 minutes, but we got 30,000, bro
Fuck

[Verse 21]
Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all of the 'mc' squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of is
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's about the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
One of the fuckin' nuns started, like, really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words
About how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, [?] for certain
You keep it

[Verse 22]
You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny- I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

[Verse 23]
In Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chilling with them women, you know they be tense
They'd be tense or more, they'd be tense or more
I like to talk to all these people, 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listeners are trying to make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doing, they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowing
Damn, I've been living in a headache
Bitches never listening, they saying that they ready
But... I can never believe them
Got these goal and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willing to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doing, next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm living out
In my mind's eye, giving out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps lower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all filling pages that have nothing
Ooo, but I have got something to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speaking from late nights, I'm thinking of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinking, one day, I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in the music I use to influence
I do this to way harder than people assuming
Resuming my writing, viewing this lighting
And that puts me to be in the view of the hiding
I do what they liking, but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowing, the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded base-s
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living, in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-e-n, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at this face
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doing, I'm already prepared
I've been waiting like 30,000 years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even 17, 18, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me
Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it
That people say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on a stages, and now I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb those whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one on vacation
I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first
But that radio station playing it, and making it just get to the worst, my head's gonna burst
If I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah
Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey.. nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you did this
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, ""Oh, this kid is big""
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh.. I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so gentle I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving, time to change, and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to that mother, kids, the mother kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B

[Interlude 7]
I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!

[Verse 24]
We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm- chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite the fact
That I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim or hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya'- round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man

[Hook 8]
So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But- what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?

[Verse 25]
I've seen people misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can- feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
No shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit
I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms
To help you listen to original bits
I- have got a lot of digital prints
Man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable
'Cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire, you can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if yo discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid

[Verse 26]
Aye, yo', what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, ho'
Yeah, when I bug out in it then I gotta
Stay low you know I'm coming at them
Shakes like you same boat wait so inhale
The fumes while I paint this picture me
I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Trying to make my most wild a huge any
Famous I knew that to some shit I
Couldn't do I was jaded then somehow I'm
Next up yeah I'm blessed up now I wake
Up and I'm fly I don't dress up now I'm
Flying my opponents better catch up I
Get my check sir
All y'all need a step up I remember
Trying to practice my cadence and tracks
I was making I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash and
They were right but I tarnish it and
Made a right shit is day and night now I
Gotta take a plate and Vegas might not
Stay the night everybody see me eat and
Now they wanted to take a place one like
Ok no way yeah when it comes to this
Shit man I don't play I'm like Houdini
And my ghost you can't see me I'm gone
But so hard I gotta wear my Easy's to
Prom you two bitches asking me to
Retweet day songs I'm the reason people
Got Spotify Premium on
Like, aye, yo' what you say though?
But I could come and straight out of the
Bay though you'll when our workout in a
10 I gotta stay low you know I'm running
To them checks like Usain Bolt
So I'm like ok not no way but a
Constitution man I don't play if you ask
Me I got 'em I will say I'm gonna drive
You over looking over the roadway, uh

[Interlude 8]
Damn
Some of these are
Too slow and less and also too fast
Whatever

[Verse 27]
I'm out of order three oh it's
Like I'm Santa Claus pull up on your
Bitch babe buddy with a camouflage hey
Now here what's the play now I'm trying
To slide I attack him about a playground
Yeah I remember bottom phase I would
Stay down 20K still in in my PayPal, so
What the fuck you wanna say you wanna
Say now nothing
Best in my town and as note these
Sketches humble beginning say humble we
Win it if I wanna bag that's my humble decision
Everything I do is going off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, aye

[Interlude 9]
I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die

[Hook 9]
I think she blocked me on
The Instagram I need to know what that I
Do I guess I missed your plan if me I'm
The searching for the troopers shit
Where is it man I never know just wanted
You to help me understand I need some
Closure because truthfully I give a damn
I gave a damn plenty of fish in the sea
But see I ain't no pleasure man see I'm
A middle man of it man and it means it's
There digging in the sand looking for a
Reason I'm not kidding man

[Verse 28]
How am I gonna let all of this get to me? Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity, ain't no way that you can mess with me
And in the big picture, this shit doesn't matter, but right now, It's feeling like everything
The more I think about it, it just gets sadder, I 'member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' about so many things, what did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things, I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it and all of the things that I'd said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked? I just cannot wrap my head around it

[Interlude 10]
I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watching this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment, ""Arrowhead water"", in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of 10
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real- that you're real one
You know what I'm saying? Alright, here we go

[Verse 29]
Spectacular speculations, I'm havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements that's travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and reality left them baseless
I wish that we left them nameless, associate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations and watch as their heads are shaking
These people want me to crumble and turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation and focus on education

[Hook 10]
But I'm petty petty petty petty, that's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit, that I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram, I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think that love is either gold or a scam, and you never really know till the end, like, how all this began

[Verse 30]
I've been comin' at this as a man, trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly, and I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's how it goes when they stalk me and do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes when a basic bitch try to block me, uh

[Verse 31]
Livin' life, but you stay the same how you expect
Yourself to go take the fan making name
But you don't take the pen you wanna be
Unique but not make it change like what
How you expect to go through this think
About the girls man why you wanna do is
So stupid and useless if you never lose
It with yourself a little for the
Movement when I write the St. the ode to
Joy' this the oldest success don't know
If there is a God but I know that I'm
Blessed and I'm hoping to know and I'm
Open to yes I'll do whatever I can to go
To the best that will go to the right
And go to the left no doubt imma show up
At night instead of going to bed when I
Know that I'm right I'm exploding my
Chest I keep on loading the time and it
Goes over my head I think no why do I
Even try these things I need shiny
Things like diamond rings and flying
Rings and preci bling that is what
Drives these strains I'm so I'm so
Lively and lazy at the same time saying
Something sane and crazy in the same
Rhyme never go to practice who don't
Faze me 'til it's game time
Learning his life will amaze me how I
Made my define a minute
When a wetland is favorite the mik
Children they get so pissed with me I'm
Either villain now they no kidding and
No I'm not quitting I know I'm just
Sitting sitting with a dream and maybe
Maybe just sit in this city where the
Dream could take me but I know it can't
I know it tastes look I'm angry why I
Just the B of the A-team at the
Feet of the mainstream man I dream for
This daydream and I believe that I'm
Making it cease for the taking it's me
In a train and I see that I'm breaking
My knees aren't place and I keep on
Thinking that I'm being amazing but I'm
Improving I know it's just a slow climb
Pushing myself yeah I'll be there in no
Time so I'm moving I'm moving till I get
There get where I just don't want to get
Left there

[Interlude 11]
I don't remember I don't even
Know what that's from but that was
Written in there it's been a lot of late
Nights okay

[Hook 11]
I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I’m threatening, they don’t wanna let ‘em in
They told me if I take it, I’ll feel better, like it’s medicine
But I ain’t settling, they tryna’ rush me, like adrenaline

[Verse 32]
And labels don't reply so I
Can't get it deal I mean is it footage
Did someone get me a Benadryl
I got a hell of skill man they worried
That I never will a success in skills
Men are done seven mill I think about
Food by the chair I'll be going over
Putting the determinant shame in the
Hypocrites women nobody buzzer okay that
One's for you huh
I'm wanna Christmas as a Christmas gift
Middle child no I'm anything but in the
Middle bitch man I don't give a shit I'm
Behaving saw ridiculous I'm the type to
Add my fucking seat Sephora syllabus ah
Existential crisis every day I think I
Don't exist you check a little I'm a
Frying pan I'm a dying man I wake up
Every damn I make a fucking diagram and
Find a plan to be the highest man in the
Sky Atlanta rap so fucking hard I think
I'm entering my diaphragm Iron Man think
I'm Iron Man because we couldn't fire
Emojis of my entire gram I'm a fireman
Second grade teacher got me singing in
The choir man and like a word a my notes
Thought I would acquired its carbon soot
A bunch of random shit in climate man
That's so much I do not give a fuck
Let's go to Ireland under grand on those
Rubber bands hold your fucking bands
Listening to the cash register like your
Fucking Jam don't understand like a
Republican with a gun in his hand saying
That Trump is a man to come to the plan
Living in Wonderland this it is a
Fucking scam making America each other
That's dumb again, huh?

[Verse 33]
They told me I
Needed to do a switch up my friends told
Me I needed to get my hips up it ain't
That simple I'm not someone that white
Teenagers wanna be like I can't say it
Sir and a mimin hard to pick up pick up

Dimension c-137 is my biggest version
I'll be disturbing his music it isn't
Listed as
Urban air quotes next to my name of red
Caps that's bird and I'm a fucking
Burden to every fucking person I'm this
Earthman I'm determined either trying to
Get a book and sorted out pins and
Needles like an amateur surgeon that
Makes no sense
All these listeners are so dense the
Song is conversational so why you still
Talking to me just went out so why are
You talking to me I'm trying to give you
Free money not fondue your feet
I'm tryna to make a deal not call the
Police I have free publicity they don't
Want to be seen I guess they don't wanna
Be seen fuck these monopoly seats you're
They collapse rabble's 150 plays I hit
Him up about it away 60 days now I'm
Bigger than these rappers I'm asking I
Hit him up again and then I never get a
Response damn what the fuck is happening
Damn, I said-

[Hook 12]
F-fuck a lawsuit, fuck a lawsuit
What'd it cost me, what'd it cost you
Cost you a kike gotta stop you y'all are not cute
Huh no need to argue 'cause I do not lose, aye, uh

[Verse 34]
A who is your mama I need to
Know who taught you I need to how you
Believe it I'm sure that nobody believes
You I make it I'm making music as soon
As the thumbing of money you're trying
To review you hadn't claimed a reverse
On my album are you gonna claim these
Two 'cause I am independent you a little
Jealous and you skeptical if I'm pretty
Selling you assuming that I can legit
Offender I'm a senior I hear what a
Prison sentence you copyright abusive
Pricks trying to profit off my music
Shit his little do you know that I'm not
Afraid of you until I refuse to quit you
Stupid bitch
For real my chick on mass appeal hey
Every Sunday the top is an anthem you
Don't really have to kneel damn restart
You don't have to steal don't like we
Hide the deal damn if I say the teller I
Feel is reeling I've had no drill damn
But Kali we had a deal me to shit ain't
Daffodils damn when the dough comes down
My door can deploy a happy meal hey if
It doesn't have to go never try late
Riser do come and I'm gonna have to
Chill yet it's a new way yelling - Laney
You say you gonna start tomorrow or
Tomorrow - day I get I get all these
Bags stuff a minute suitcase with these
To be spin up clothes like you was Boonk Gang

[Interlude 12]
I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just- trying to piece it together like a puzzle
You know what I'm saying?
Aye, let's go random shit, aye

[Verse 35]
I take no credit for anything that I do
But I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seen pissed but I'm
Never getting mad at you that's the
Reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is some
Places shit nobody else's world did and
I'm just trying to spread some pieces
Love my man it's really hard cuz you
Need some love I've been waiting cuz
This is defense time for me to be laying
Out of business and I'm breathing in the
Air but it all tastes
When all of this time is wasted really
Ain't wasted

[Interlude 13]
This is trash, I don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this

[Verse 36]
It's bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, and when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good- groove is really a great recipe
Can't- mess with me, no one, I'm feeling too in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm- noddin' yes, and then I am proddin' next
And I'm tryna' to mentally send God a text
Like, ""Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel like a god
But, y-you get what I'm sayin'?""
And God damn, I just can't really express when I'm playing

[Verse 37]
Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is- something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream, shit
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got- energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, it's maybe costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this
I'm still trying to master this, 'cause now I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really- just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Trying to make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that, when I'm done, you're left sobbing
But that won't happen, like I said, we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjusting, see me bluffin'
Everyday, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna' make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is- that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason- that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin', yeah

[Interlude 14]
Nearing- we're nearing an hour if you're still
Watching the shit I love you I actually
Like love you long time
Okay

[Hook 13]
I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna'
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', I said, ""Fuck it, I'm livin'""
People are getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, aye
Aye, aye, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, eh

[Verse 38]
Yeah, time to move on, grindin' out all my new songs
My only motivation is people I need to prove wrong
Yeah
Said, my only motivation is- yeah
And, how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna' find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in my stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Man, it's scary for a king, even-, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe in it, even it up for free, and
The meaning is really scenin', no line can be wrong between em'
I don't show seasons, I am me, no matter what
And that can grow pleasin', I'm barely close to anybody
I don't know people, man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that it just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, I'm new to the life, I'm new in my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
The next minute, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
And I just wish- that they would fucking go away
And I won't obey, no I will- never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up with other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G', but now I'm movin' onto other notes, yeah

[Interlude 15]
My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting, a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- d do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights, I know the stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh

[Verse 39]
Everyone knows that it's so amazing, all the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital, my name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it, people liked it before they watched it
I'm on a way too much more than I have, and I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I got a vision of talking a lot of wisdom, and I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow, I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy, people consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses, I'm hurt because I'm on loaded bases
Advancing, I know the basics, already know them, they're overrated than me
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hoping, because now I am open for game
I'm charged up, I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players, don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares? I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers, and bitch, I am going so later
I got time, my own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines, and I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go

[Hook 14]
I've been living life all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, I'm all on my own
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own

[Verse 40]
My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
Sue a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-

[Interlude 16]
Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
10,000 more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one-take!

[Verse 41]
-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
Its not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man

[Hook 15]
Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
I ain't the star of the show, bitch

[Verse 42]
I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And if time is money then free time ain't really free
And sometimes I get pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
They stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy a lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital

[Interlude 17]
Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics
Uh

[Verse 43]
Rebirth, feet hit the earth
My knees hurt
They're weaker than
Previously, her breathing seems to be burnt like
Free CDs were before we
Could be searched
I'm like please, just please work
Like a lenient slave owner
That's edgy like gravestones
Oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley
Two percent there already
I may go for a Chevy
'Cause who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy
Uh, I've been trying’ to prove to all of the people I knew
Who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, ""Ew""
Yeah, this shit goes outta you
Plans have now all become true
Seeing them through
Man, that's the reason I do
All of the things that I do
It's not for a crew
Not for a god or a demon
I've really been needing a clue
Filling these shoes
Reading these pieces and news
Damn this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues
Whenever i'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss
Then why this ignorance be killin’ kids
And why's this ignorance is truly vicious it's not giving shit and ends up innocent
That shit really is ridiculous it's magnificently
Fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up
I've even seen it goin down, it's comin’ up-

[Verse 44]
'Kay to the Vatican having
Them good times and bad times new Romans
Do that again when I was when I was so
Young too young to really know fun but
So but I guess that's what happens when
You grow up dry your eyes and wipe your
Nose up just keep drinking till you
Throw up tell me one judge but we all
Just want to be loved and somehow get
Validated by those we hate such a
Twisted system that we've been given to
Harmful a I've been really thinking and
Faker right now is not a fake wash away
The thoughts of me along the way are all
Has changed yeah and now we looking is
So far away and it's a far away just a

[Hook 16]
Civil war
Segment war you'll be the aiming to the
Piece of what we can afford
Yeah anymore what we even living for

Civil war

[Verse 45]
You know you know they be
Looking at me right now like the source

I've been reading my essays my web page
Yeah I caught our new construction site
Now with his praise man I think I gotta
Find out all these questions man I
Really wanna hide down oh I want to drop
Out maybe learn a lot about my strip
Before our way to see it die out damn I
Just want to go along I'm holding strong
I know I know I'm not the Botes one I'm
Old enough from throwing up bars so sick
It doing that they know it's up down
Minute now I really don't know done and
A babe race like I got drafted for
Freddie year-round hype over March
Madness wanna get to what his girls
Stripping down like his know they feel
Like we takin liberal all his classes
Ay be saying damn bad when the gods
Savage number on like

[Interlude 18]
Hold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental
This is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick
I'm gonna fix it, take a pause
Uh, yeah, aye

[Verse 46]
I'm addicted to the screen and the
Validations of people who are 13 in
Another nation I've been looking for
Seven sent a message or a comment on a
Video it seems to be wasted like
Internet track meets they II traced it
Look at this shit I just recently made
It that's how it goes when I'm beaten
And breathing achieving and keep on
Succeed in there Haiti y'all lousy they
Can't breathe all that smoke bro you
Doubt me but just see where I'll go so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out there be me believe in my own
Zone things become intense of the heat
Of the ozone is surrounding me I need to
Go home so can I pretty please just be
All alone nobody to retweet to leave on
My home phone I ain't gonna I'm gonna
Hop in a drug shit when they all come
And they love it ain't gonna happen
Allow sure when I know I ain't about it
Yeah they're gonna take us away now they
Got something to say now you can order
This shit on a take-out
All of these this
Is a fake now

[Verse 47]
Okay so all my clothes is Japanese
I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic
Might cause a couple casualties
And all I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man I said fuck the peanut gallery
I got a fuckin' allergy
Trappin down my PayPal make it friends and family
Now I'm so hot I need some oven mitts
Ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify
They pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity
Okay so everybody 'round me they been wasting my time, ay
Pull up to the Functions and see they face when I rhyme, ay
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself
I don't need a way to get signed

[Hook 17]
Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, aye
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, aye
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, aye

[Verse 48]
Okay I'm backing

Wanna go package it I don't give a
Fucking home abstinent for the whole
Game about accident when I'm gonna do
Passion it's Edison ever method okay
Happening my buddy used to hold back but
This and I hit me up like whatever
Typing in yeah I had to sacrifice a lot
Of sleep because a lot of people wanna
Love from me hey standing in the way of
Who I wanna be no random strangers
Recognize me when I cross the street

[Verse 49]
So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Put it all off to the side
Feeling the vibe, got this new sorrowful happiness
That I just can't seem to guide
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Every morning I wake up, I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
You know I put too much work into this shit just to pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not going to say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I ain't mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
I'm practicing hard
Never going back to the start, never going back to the start

[Verse 50]
You should know that I'm putting my work on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining these cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen
I'm eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping it, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist

I'm feeling the largest

[Part III]

[Interlude 19]
Oh!

Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..

Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did though
Uh
Yeah
Aye

[Verse 51]
Recently I've been feeling my lyrics
Missing meaning I'm trying to whitewash
How much they stink like I'm list arena
Damn I'm feeling like I've missed the
Key and so I guess that DJ Khaled is
Always skipping me but yeah you know I'm
Trying to do what I can but these
Ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah you know I'm trying to do what I
Can but these ignorant idiots just can't
Understand I got new crews and a new
Friends got new views in the new lens on
The new dude I'm the new bank on my
YouTube but a new trance but the way I'm
Growing is so unorthodox how could I be
Connecting them áfive you had to sort
The dots sort of lost them very found at
The same time a port of cause now I'm
Very loud in a daytime and very quiet at
Night each team is shy when I write and
I'm longing to be a five-year-old
Chillin flying a kite and I admire the
Sight of somebody just working more than
Me I've been staying grounded but the
Sky is moving towards my feet and
Fortunately I'm on course Livermore
Burley grinding to get what's rightfully
Mine I'm headed right for my dream
Damn I guess that's all I needed know
For now they put me in the driver's seat
No way I'm slowing down they know me now
But don't know my son did it so profound
Give me them two years and I'll make it
Let me show you how hey, hey, hey, hey I
Got a stop all of this bragging shit so
Many haters as a mace is the acronym I'm
Trying to get a couple OMGs over WTF he
Is so sexy I got no Ben leave it be the
So deadly walked up to the rap club no
Entry and I feel a little like I won't
Get see cuz I'm so white won't fight you
Don't get me cuz I'm coming that his
Music with a different set of ideas he's
Trying to bring my own crib like it's
IKEA here's a protip
No gifts from people who are close yet
Bitch is always so stressed damn cuz
They trying to find a great escape
Nation of dreamers who are just trying
To stay awake every day I'd be waking up
To my 8 away stay today hustle I'm just
Trying to pave a way people that have
Colors always get them most advice it's
Like why don't you search your own lift
Don't come closer mind I mostly find it
So please leave me alone - whining next
Time that you're talking shit please
Bring me an open mind cause people
Loggin' they own ideas a straitjacket
Some David Blaine's magic you're helping
Your brake pads that I'm trying to raise
- I'm trying to stay savage you're
Trying to make balance while finding a
Great pageant you coming to get up this
Witness an injustice about who people in
Love with the base of a skin color
Snitchin' is so this custody in their
Public I'm trying to make sense of it
Here and it discusses close my eyes and
Go to sleep waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations I'm making
Everything so complete my thoughts i
Scattered find lots of patterns I try
Not to let akin my plots and ashes I
Don't ever think on some money some
Little talent these rappers shows look
Like lifting battles with Jimmy Fallon
We're really having I'm jealous if
People selling platinum boy see around
My life like saying the words Kendrick
Goblin is way better than average
I'm already established unforgettable
Classic y'all shit is set to go plastic
You didn't want to see me disappear like
Incredible magic cube regrettable
Attitude is upsetting my passion I'm
Gonna listen to place we're gonna simply
Gaze ajik to commute birth breakouts
Part of my baby minimal break humming
It's good enough in a bitch Eden a
Feelin if I just want to make a pulling
Up I'm putting up with all the amateurs
Or enough I'ma show him how it can be
Done I got green in our beef like a
Omnivore
I got that exclusive floater can't be
Bought at stores POTUS knew should they
Still be running more to say that my
Duty is not fair like some mana war I'm
Stuck as well just like the Michelin Man
It is sushi every night but I don't live
In
Damn I'm trying to get as many hits as I
Can and like a lazy ass beaver I ain't
Giving a damn whoa the shit's corny
You're really gonna ignore me you really
Gonna let it slide when the Benjamins do
Adore me and as you guys man it ain't
About fame and fortune we got a greater
Importance that's why awakened I'm born
And I'm trying to play her performance
Hit make a change with a chorus I came
From a tiny clap / nama stage of the
Normans let's do anything to stay out of
Office because I'm cautious it's not
Gonna sell myself for the profits yeah I
Got many dreams a lot of passions imma
Get there by any means just imagine just
Know that anything can happen to take
Chances for everything you rapping I
Don't even really need to go fast flow
Back not wonder been like a nomad so
Glad you're they don't melt like a
Snowman back-to-back flames got Drake
Saying oh man not again got a lot of
Friends who want to end on my shit and
Subscribe like I'm on a man I've been
Living in a moment got a lot of fans
Pedophile back at it again with the
White vans you can't lie man I got a lot
Of white fares could I get a ultralight
Beam maybe by chance every day I've been
Switching up on my stairs scare
Everyone away whenever I dance people in
A comment saying that I can't rap okay
Cuz I didn't understand that fuck you
Man I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sitting getting in a wait like
A sandbag if you want to talk trash say
It to my face
I'll be singing ""lala"", I got to a lay
I'll be like a haha at the human race
Ham in a lead not far from a newer place
Getting sick over and sicker the flow on
The track in and quick over and quicker

Bigger kill evicted not swiping left

Mad sight hey to see changing their
Opinions is that right hey, hey, hey I'm

1532,Brick By Boring BrickParamore,"[Verse 1]
She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure
The lens I told her
The angles were all wrong now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

So one day he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground

But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve
Well, make sure to build your house brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
Then you can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah

[Chorus]
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole

1533,CousinsVampire Weekend,"[Verse 1]
You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and the smart ones sit outside of their sight
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night
Dad was a risk-taker, his was a shoe maker
You, ""Greatest Hits 2006"" little list-maker
Heard codes in the melodies, you heeded the call
Oh, you were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all

[Verse 2]
Interesting colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty, you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birthright is interest, you could just accrue it all

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

You could turn your back on the bitter world

So sentimental
Not sentimental, no
Romantic, not disgusting yet
Darling, I'm down and lonely
When with the fortunate only
I've been looking for something else
Do let, do let, do let
Jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
Distant from other interests

That's with the fortunate only
No, I gotta be someone else

It comes, it comes and goes

Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely
Do let, do let, do let
Jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
We'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over, we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days, it comes, it comes, it comes
It comes, it comes and goes

Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

If you want more love, why don't you say so?

Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all

I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now

Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name

Strut on by like a king
Telling everybody they know nothing
Long lived: what you thought you were
Time ain't on your side anymore

And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch

Step outta line and you'll get bitch-slapped back
And you can run your little mouth all day
But the hand of God just smacked you back into yesterday

But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denying you were cryin' like a bitch

Blinded by your sacred faded past times, only time is your enemy
Granted a second chance to prove that your arrogance is
Stronger than you'll ever be… it's stronger than you can be

But I've told you one too many times

If heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then I've got a story to tell
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I guess you're going straight to hell!

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna leave you now or never
'Cause we're perfect together
Never wanna be apart
Dared to take on the simple life

There was trouble for us when I came home early
Never would expect to see this
It's fair to say I could not believe my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say
So I made a list of how you're going to pay

[Chorus]
I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can
'Cause, I took your car
With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby, now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk

[Verse 2]
Now I feel better
But it's hard to forget
I never think of looking back
'Cause time has no meaning when you're free
This is what you get
Karma, bitch
Now I see who you really are
'Cause happiness is the best revenge

[Pre-Chorus]
But caught red handed with a grin on your face
Didn't think you'd be easy to replace

[Chorus]
I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can
'Cause, I took your car
With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby, now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk

Again and again and again and again and e-yeah....
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then I've got a story to tell
If heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I know I'm going straight to hell

I locked you out
Left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run
I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can

With your baby in the back seat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat

I thought tonight would suck like every other night
I'd party with my friends
But when I saw you grooving on the dance floor
Normal came to an end
We started talking and man, it was so clear to me
There's no one else like you
You got the brains, the body, and the beauty
To top it off, you're cool

Of what it is I do
I'll take you out to dinner at Palermo's
We'll split a cheese fondue

This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight

If you tire
Try my best to moonwalk
On the wire
I just want to, ooh ah
Feel your fire
Feel your fire
Feel your fire!

You are my baby tonight

We're bound to wait all night
She's bound to run amok
Invested enough in it anyhow
And to each his own
The garden is sorting out
She curls her lips on a barrel
""I don't know if you're dead or not
If you're anyone""

[Pre-Hook]
Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many heads, to analyze
Come on and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And they want to get up in your head

[Hook]
Cause they know and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour in your new life
Tell all of your friends goodbye

[Verse 2]
The dawn to end all nights
That's all we hoped it was
A break from the warfare in your house
But to each his own
A soldier is bailing out
And curled his lips on the barrel
And I don't know if the dead can talk, to anyone

[Pre-Hook]
Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many heads, are you one of us?
Come on and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And they want to get up in your head

[Hook]
Cause they know and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour in your new life
Tell all of your friends goodbye

It's too late to change your mind
You've let loss be your guide

It's too late to change your mind
You've let loss be your guide"

Every day, every afternoon
Tried so hard
But lost to God
I thought you're my friend

I look to the clouds
God gives me a frown

[Chorus]
This time next year
I'll be married
This time next year
I'll say sorry

Jesus stole my girlfriend

Meant more than a kiss

Like you do girl

To glory and fun
But Jesus is here
He ate up our fears

You used to do a little, but a little won't fly
Right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time

[Bridge]
Can it please you still?
Were you named in your father's will?
Or does it make you ill?
Let us bruise their knees
We will aim straight for the feet
You will be relieved, so relieved, so relieved
To your full desire
Feel the sparks of the friendly fire
Misery inspires
Your throat has been cut several times before
Never noticed the size of the flow
It can't be ignored

[Chorus]
To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Carefully look over your shoulder

[Post-Chorus]
You said you believe it, but believing won't fly
Right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time

And when it's all over and you open your eyes
You'll see the room turned on its side
And you'll be lying by a note on the floor, signed:

The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we

The royal we
The royal we

Praying for some salvation 'cause she’s oh so bored
In my vile sex horror and my cheap drugs hell

Born of foul creation
Born of sour milk, cocaine filth

You staggered here on broken glass

What do we have to argue 'bout?

[Chorus]
I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

[Bridge]
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take

[Verse 2]
Leave me all alone before
Get out the way
Never did what she was told
Get out the way
Seems to play at time of war
Get out the way
Less is big and listens more

[Chorus]
Lovely disguise
Read between the lines
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation
Three
Four
You sell what you bought
And there ain't no magic pen
To get back what you lost

[Post-Chorus]
I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when we used to take drugs

[Bridge]
Even when we used to take
Used to take
Even when we used to take
Used to take
Take
Even when we used to take
Used to take
Even when we used to take
Take

Love, electricity, shockwave central

Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Oh, Stylo (juice)
Go for blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (it's the giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes (as it leaps from the stream)
Then I'll know the twilight skies (blood curdles, it's a death throw)
Are not so broken hearted (hot from the end of the line)

[Hook: Bobby Womack]
If it's love, it's electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself (juice)
Out of depression, rise above
All recession, if I know your heart
Electric is the love

[Verse 3: Bobby Womack]
There's only one way
Let it play a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world, in another world, in a universe, oh!
Right now, here's what we've got to do

If it's love, it's electric

1558,White Flag WarriorFlobots,"[Intro: Jonny 5]
We request to negotiate
We come to you unarmed
We desire to communicate
You cannot do us harm

[Verse 1: Jonny 5]
They want sacrifice
They have schemes and ask me to follow their path to the afterlife
I've got an appetite
For nice things and pipe dreams that my enemies could be blasted by
Ooh metaphors
Views that are better for you can't survive or find your competitor
Rise together
Or Fight separate wars I pray I'm never forced to be a predator

[Brer Rabbit]
Spectres spectate
We won't last
They're glad to hate
When gladiators
Breathe their last
Scream en masse
When the dreams do clash
Like swords in the war
Let me bleed on that
But they feed on that
Say we need strong backs
Call us weak
And don't redeem contracts
But the feast won't last
When this beast attacks
The sons and the fathers
Will be free at last

[Pre-Chorus: Jonny 5 (Tim McIlrath)]
(This is love, it's not treason)(x4)

They see sharks in the estuary
They claim the ark is Bartholomew's
They say war is necessary
But we say war is child abuse

[Chorus: Tim McIlrath (Jonny 5)]
We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

[Verse 2: Brer Rabbit]
Core-to-core
Were the one's we've been waiting for
We hold steady
Steadier than stevedores
Not tevias or matadors
On matters of what came before
Forgive the debts
And settle scores
And test the mettle
Either/or
What's your plan go to do with me?
If the bell tolls, let freedom ring
And find the new ways if we must be king
Instead of leading the young to our suffering

[Jonny 5]
We pass testaments down scream back at heaven
For testing us like Wednesday's at 11
Want to recruit and train us to act evilly
Save it for the shooting range
And smack DVDs
Won't study war no more this millennium
It's never again for me or anyone
So think harder when you refer to us
Rather make our children martyrs than murders

[Pre-Chorus: Jonny 5 (Tim McIlrath)]
(This is love, this is not treason)x4

They shell dwellings to quell the shellings (This is love)
And lift taboos to seduce the cowards (This is not treason)
They say we're too yellow bellied (This is love)
But we say we're the new superpower (This is not treason)

[Chorus: Tim McIlrath (Jonny 5)]
We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

[Bridge: Jonny 5]
We seek ways to not be liable (This is love)
We claim to speak for a higher truth (This is not treason)
We stand opposed to the homicidal (This is love)
We tell you you are fire proof (This is not treason)

[Chorus: Tim McIlrath & (Jonny 5)]
We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)

We'd rather make our children

Ask us what you will
Demand from us a sacrifice

1560,You And Your HeartJack Johnson,"[Verse 1]
Watch you when you say
What you are and when you blame everyone
You broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

[Chorus]
But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

[Verse 2]
You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

[Chorus]
But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

Oh, and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard?

[Verse 3]
You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How are you going to scratch any backs?
Better hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines and

Hope the tide will take our lines and
Hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines away"

Let me hear you scream!

[Verse 1]
I'm black and bruised, beat up, but still I take the blows
Because all I need is blood and sweat and skin and bones
I'll take this rage, rattle your cage, nobody said it's easy
It's do or die, only the strong survive, get ready for the last stand
Get ready, I'm your hangman

I'll pull you up and push you right back in your place
I'll take you down and wipe that smile right off your face
I'll watch you break your mine to take, don't blink; you just might miss it
It's all or nothing, nowhere left to run, are you ready for the last fight
Get ready with the war cry

Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it

And the needle breaks
Come run away with me
Come on, you'll see

1563,The Crow & The ButterflyShinedown,"[Verse 1]
I painted your room at midnight
So I'd know yesterday was over
I put all your books on the top shelf
Even the one with the four leaf clover
Man, I'm getting older

[Verse 2]
I took all your pictures off the wall
And wrapped them in a newspaper blanket
I haven't slept in what seems like a century
And now I can barely breathe

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late

[Verse 3]
Your words still serenade me
Your lullabies won't let me sleep
I've never heard such a haunting melody
Oh, it's killing me
You know I can barely breathe

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away

When you and I were getting high as outer space

1564,In One EarCage The Elephant,"[Verse 1]
They say that we ain't got the style, we ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's gonna put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise, tryna make the radio
I'm an antisocial anarchist who sound like so-and-so
They say I'm just a stupid kid, another crazy radical
Rock 'n' roll is dead, I probably should have stayed at school
Another Generation X who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh, they'd love to see me fall, but I'm already on my back

[Chorus]
So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

[Verse 2]
Now I know I'm not a saint, I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws, I'd rather keep them in the light
They want to criticize, scrutinize, cast another stone
Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from their throne
They say the devil is my pal, I do a lot of drugs
The crowd will only like me if they're really fucking drunk
They think they know my thoughts, but they don't know the least
If they'd listen to the words they'd find a message tucked beneath

[Chorus]
But it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit even though they never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

[Bridge]
You hear that? You hear what's coming?
Oh, you better run for the hills
Cause we're coming to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down

[Verse 3]
Here's the moral to the story: we don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money, we don't do it for the fame
So all the critics who despise us, go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us, adds the fire to our flames

[Outro]
And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit so you know we never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
I'm only playing music cause you know I fucking love it
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand"

Am I going insane?
My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling attacks (attacks)
My body's shaking, there's no turning back
Don't take your eyes off the trigger!

As your eyes start to blister!
There's just no hope for our final embrace

Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding as I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames
I love you crying and screaming my name
You said that we'd be forever!
How could you kill me and lie to my face?
Now that we can't be together!
There's just no hope for our final embrace

[Pre-Chorus]
So here we are
I'm in your head
I'm in your heart!

You were told to run away
Soak the place, and light the flame

And the feelings left inside
Comes a time you need to leave all that behind
Well they claim they'd like to know
Anyone could let it go
And the people gather 'round for the last show

Well there is a reward
To live and die by the sword
Well they tried to complicate you
But you left it all behind
All worldly possessions
Are left for recollection
And finally it's all gone

What is lost can still be found
When you hop up off your feet, you're on the ground
Well there's some who choose to run
Following the setting sun
And now it seems the journey has begun

The indulgence of our lives has cast a shadow on our world
Our devotion to our appetites betrayed us all
An apocalyptic plight
More destruction will unfold
Mother Earth will show her darker side and take her toll

[Verse 1]
It's just another way to die
There can be no other reason why
You know we should have seen it coming
Consequences we cannot deny will be revealed in time
Glaciers melt as we pollute the sky
A sign of devastation coming
We don’t need another way to die
Can we repent in time?

[Pre-Chorus]
The time bomb is ticking and no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?

It's just another way to die
Ooh, can we repent in time?

Greed and hunger led to our demise
A path I can't believe we followed
Black agenda's rooted in a lie

A world that they cannot survive in left them with another way to die
Are we dead inside?

The time bomb is ticking and no one is listening
Our future is fading

Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever (Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed (Burn the world your last endeavor)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air

You're now a slave until the end of time here

While your nightmare comes to life

Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason (Loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)

And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""

Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!), hit the wall (Wall!), watch you crawl (Crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life

[Chorus]
Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me
In me"
1573,Lesson LearnedAlice In Chains,"[Verse 1]
Just another lesson learned
Wear a scar, a bore repeating
Take a simple fateful turn
Opened up to stop the bleeding

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

[Chorus]
Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

[Verse 2]
Just another brick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

[Chorus]
Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

[Bridge]
You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
Just another lesson learned

[Bridge]
You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
Just another lesson learned

Just another lesson learned"
1574,Kick In The TeethPapa Roach,"[Verse 1]
We live in a cold dark world with venom in it's fangs
You can spit it in my face but I know I'll be okay
It's on the attack, it's a war, it's a game
A ball and chain, chew my arm off to get away
Don't fight it
Or deny it
Invite it

'Cause when it feels like a kick in the teeth, I can take it
Throw your stones and you won't see me break it

Don't fight it
Or deny it

Behind the gun, I'll make my final stand, yeah

You make my teeth clench and my hands shake
Do you ever see what you do to me?
Wearing me out, just wearing me out
But I'm wearing you down

You're impossible to love or leave
So impossible to win or please
I'm wearing you out, just wearing you out

Take everything from me
It means nothing now

Try to think through what I can do to you
It's wearing me thin
Can I begin to wear you out?

Take everything from me
It means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive; harder to forget
Take what you want

1578,The Sound (John M. Perkins' Blues)Switchfoot,"[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1]
The static comes in slow
You can feel it grow
Our stream of conscience flows
Under the streets below
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
The rivers made of sound
Still running underground
Runs like a silent flood
We run as thick as blood

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Can you hear it rise
Up from the ground?
Can't drown it out
Can you hear it now?

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our own collisions
We are the voice of breaking down

[Verse 3]
The static comes alive
Beneath the broken skies
John Perkins said it right
""Love is the final fight""
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let it rise above
Rise above
There is no song
Louder than love

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our own collisions
We are the voice of breaking down
Down!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let it rise above
Up from the ground
Can't drown it out
Can you hear it now?

[Chorus]
This is the sound
Of a heartbeat
This is the sound
From the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down
Can you hear me?
This is the sound
Of a desperation bound
By our fallen condition
We are the voice of breaking down

This is the sound, this is the sound"
1582,Lights OutBreaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
I am done pretending
You have failed to find what's left
I will suck you dry again
Some are not worth saving
You are such a pretty mess
I will choke the life within

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you want to take me down
As if I even care
I am the monster in your head
And I thought you'd learn by now
It seems you haven't yet
I am the venom in your skin
And now your life
Is broken

[Chorus]
After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care

You have failed to pull me in
I will drag you down again
Life is unrelenting
Feeding lies into my head
I will feed the lies you live

Maybe I'm the only one

Maybe I'm just out of touch

What am I waiting for?
Cause nothing stays the same
Maybe it's time to change

1584,Black RainSoundgarden,"[Verse]
If I could hock my love, could I trade
For your wings to cover me, unless I fall?
Half aligned, I heard the most brilliant lie
To sleep these eyes, closed the light
And lets the mind wide open

You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue, you save face
Or feeding on the blood that's running from a black day

Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain

By cutting out your tongue to save face

1585,Ready To StartArcade Fire,"[Verse 1]
The businessmen are drinking my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
And I guess I'll just begin again
You say, ""Can we still be friends?""

[Chorus 1]
If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not

All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But they bow down to him anyway
Because it's better than being alone

[Chorus 1]
If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not

Now you're knocking at my door
Saying, ""Please come out with us tonight""

Than pretend I feel alright
If the businessmen are drinking my blood
Like the kids at art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, ""Can we still be friends?""

If I was scared, I would
And if I was pure, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not

My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Not sure you'll open the door
To step out into the dark
Now I'm ready"

Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now

Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want a little more

You give them all you got and you give them a little more
And never even know what for
They feed and they suck until you're unconscious
It's never enough, they kill your subconscious

Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding?
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now

Suffocate integrity 'til I'm not breathing
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now

Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more
Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more

Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more

All the distractions kill the compassion
Suddenly fame has lost its attraction

Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding?

1587,MemoriesWeezer,"[Verse 1]
Pissing in plastic cups before we went on stage
Playing hackey sack back when Audioslave was still Rage
Watching all the freaky Dutch kids vomit then have sex
Listening to techno music on the bus while we earned our checks

[Chorus]
Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again

[Verse 2]
Messing with the journalists and telling stupid lies
They had a feeling that something was up
Because of the look in our eyes
In fact we didn't know what we were doing half of the time
We were so sure of ourselves and sure of our way through life

Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again

Now I got so many people that I got to look out for
Never know when I'll become awake and buy some food at the store
I can hear them babies crying and the lawn needs to be mowed
I got to get my groove on because I'm freaking bored!

[Chorus]
Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again"
1589,Life Won't WaitOzzy Osbourne,"[Verse 1]
I watch it all change
Take the news of the day
And throw it away
Time will kill all the pain
Faith will cure the decay
Of all this blind ambition
The greed brings us together
Stay strong, stay true, be brave - it all comes down to you

[Verse 2]
Tried to just let it go
Know that justice moves slow
But it comes in the end
Rise the guilty will fall
Stay they can't take it all
They want the unimportant
It's love they leave behind
Stand up, stay true, be hard - the future looks to you

[Verse 3]
Every second you throw away
Every minute of every day
Don't get caught in a myriad
Because life won't wait for you
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

[Verse 4]
I'm watching the change
Through who will carry the flame
It all feels very strange
Dreams than mean can be good
Faith - to live as we should
And know we're all connected
We give ourselves the power
Stay strong stay true be brave - it all comes down to you

[Verse 5]
Every day that you wait you're falling faster
No sleight of hand, no twist of fate, no ever after
When it's gone - it's gone, a fight to the bitter end
Life won't wait for you
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

Life won't wait for you, my friend [x4]"
1590,Shameful MetaphorsChevelle,"[Verse 1]
Fear, it's all the same
Should I evolve to tend to these sights
Said out loud then said again
If fate's so wrong you start to feel light-headed
By my admission nothing grows
Just a longer list of unsorted laws

[Chorus]
So why then has all my life made no sound?
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing

[Verse 2]
Revolting man, this sacred chain
Brought down to trial
No better man could fail the way
You needed all, keep close the vein of empty thoughts
The finest river, the ravens tend
All along insisting, we're worlds away

[Chorus]
So why then has all my life made no sound?
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing

[Bridge]
Behold the lost
Behold a Band-Aid
Behold the lost
Behold a Band-Aid

These shameful metaphors
Fought it through the teeth
Shameful metaphors
Biting at your heels
Shameful metaphors
Fought it cheek to cheek

[Chorus]
So why then has all my life made no sound?
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing"

While everybody else is getting out of bed

And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer

About husband and wife
There's no happy endings
No Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

Took a loan on a house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I want to buy ya everything
Except cologne
'Cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain
Where the rain falls mainly on the plain
Sounds insane
Because it is, we can laugh, we can sing
Have ten kids and give them everything
Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad that we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face

If it's love

You can move in
I won't ask where you've been
Because everybody has a past

1600,Half Of My HeartJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1: John Mayer]
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 2: John Mayer]
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 3: John Mayer]
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

[Backup Vocals: Taylor Swift]
I can't stop loving you

But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

[Chorus 2: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do

[Outro: John Mayer ]
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart"
