High HopesPanic! At The Disco,"[Intro]
High, high hopes

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Verse 2]
Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

[Bridge]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)"
Without MeHalsey,"[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)

You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

HappierMarshmello,"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)

"Eastsidebenny blanco, Halsey","[Intro: Khalid]
Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now

Sunflower (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse)Post Malone,"Author: Jorge Ramos
You did read it, and it will happen. Post Malone has recently joined the exclusive list of artists to perform on Virtual Reality. The concert, scheduled for 17 of October will take place on the Raleigh’s PNC Arena, and streamed through the Oculus Venue app. So everyone who owns an Oculus headset will be able to watch the concert on a 180 perspective through Oculus Venues.

Post Malone is ready to “Bend Minds”, according to Billboard, and they are not wrong, the concert is going to be one of the increasing amounts of events to be streamed on VR this year, through the Oculus Venue app.

The Raleigh’s PNC Arena, in North Carolina, will hold the event that will be streamed in a 180 degrees perspective through Oculus Venue, an app of the VR company to watch exclusive events through Oculus devices.

The Grammy-winning artist dropped his most recent album, Hollywood’s Bleeding, back in September with some great collaborators, such as Ozzy Osborne and Travis Scott in the track “Take What You Want”, and Halsey alongside Future for “Die For Me”. The record also includes the singles “Wow” and “Sunflower” (Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse) featuring Swae Lee, both reaching the top 10 of the Global Chart on Spotify.

Malone talked about the concert and according to Variety stated that “When putting together this tour, I wanted to make sure I was giving my fans something new and crazy with this new production and show.“ Later adding that “Working with Oculus on this VR broadcast gives fans at home a chance to sit front row with me during my North Carolina show, just like you’re in the arena. That sounds pretty f***ing cool to me.”

PREVIOUS CONCERTS BROADCASTED ON VR
The concert will make Austin Richard Post Aka Post Malone, one of the few people to have done this kind of show. Still, among important artists who have done it before there are Billie Eilish, who did it a month ago, and Tenacious D.

Tenacious D went out to do it on July 31st and many agree saying that it was a success and that the experience actually made it more comfortable. An unexpected advantage of “different state legislation” for some people, as it is mentioned in this article from The Cult Machine.
Moving a little closer on time, on September 3rd, we were able to see Billie Eilish’s concert being streamed on VR, using Oculus Venues as the platform as well. Eilish played in Madrid, Spain, and according to many articles, the experience and opinions may vary a lot, as it is explained in this article from the UploadVR.

According to iHeartRadio, she talked about the concert stating that ""I make everybody get really low, and we all jump when the drop comes in. Even though you'll be watching on a VR headset, you should still get low and jump with everyone.""

Besides music, there’s a lot of exclusive events that plan on going towards Virtual Reality, including the NBA. Last September they announced their collaboration with many VR platform to broadcast about 26 games starting this October. It is likely that soon you can watch the NFL season and bet on the Superbowl favorites, using VR technology.

VR HAS TAKEN OVER THE LAST YEAR
Although the recent concerts of some of the biggest stars of the moment have made VR reach a spotlight, there are a couple of extra apps that have taken a step forward on this remark. They are having thesigning deals with some of the biggest record labels and allowing us to feel we are on the crowds of different concerts, events or even festivals.

It is safe to say that Virtual Reality keeps breaking walls but is also worth to think for a minute how this could affect the trends, the attendances to concerts and many other factors. Also, what could change into the VR Apps for this kind of shows, if microtransactions are a possibility or any possible alteration in the near future."

Even though we're kicked out the party

We're the ones they wanna be like

ConsequencesCamila Cabello,"[Verse 1]
Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Verse 2]
Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Bridge]
No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

[Chorus 2]
Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

[Outro]
Yeah, loving you"

This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Nothing Breaks Like A HeartMark Ronson,"[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (Crash in the dark)

Spin endless circles in the bar (Spin 'round in the bar)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind
Is blowin', is blowin'
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Mmm, that nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar (Spin 'round in the bar)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, and nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

My heart, my heart
Well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
My heart, my heart
Nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar (Spin 'round in the bar)

It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart

TequilaDan + Shay,"[Verse 1]
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

[Chorus]
But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2]
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were

Be AlrightDean Lewis,"[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

[Bridge]
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

[Chorus]
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight

ShallowLady Gaga,"[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, shallow
We're far from the shallow now

Oh, ha, ah, ha

Trust My LonelyAlessia Cara,"[Verse 1]
It's time I let you go
I made the mistake, go writing your name on my heart
'Cause your colors showed
But it was too late, you left me stained, called it art
Do you crave control?
I've been your doll, that you poke for fun too long
So you should go
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more

[Chorus]
Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone
Alone, alone

[Verse 2]
There ain't no love 'round here
I loved you once, but it made me dumb
Now I'm seeing it way too clear
You hurt me numb, and for that I've run out of time
To have pain to feel (Pain to feel)
I've been your game
Just taking the blame for too long
Get on out of here
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more

[Chorus]
Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone

Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely

Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone

Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely"

8 LettersWhy Don't We,"[Verse 1: Jonah Marais]
You know me the best
You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge

Opening and closing up again
I've been hurt so I don't trust
Now here we are, staring at the ceiling

Why is it so hard to say?

[Verse 2: Daniel Seavey]
Isn't it amazing
How almost every line
On our hands align
When your hand's in mine
It's like I'm whole again
Isn't that a sign?
I should speak my mind

There's No WayLauv,"[Verse 1: Lauv]
You touch me and it’s almost like we knew
That there will be history between us two
We knew someday that we would have regrets
But we just ignored them the night we met
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touch me and it’s almost like we knew
That there will be history

[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
With the way that we’re looking at each other
There’s no way that it’s not going there
Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
With the way that we’re looking at each other

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels, Lauv & Both]
I wish I could make the time stop
So we could forget everything and everyone
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in to what we want
'Cause when I got somebody, you don't
And when you got somebody, I don't
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in

[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
With the way that we’re looking at each other
There’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
With the way that we’re looking at each other

[Bridge: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
We just dance backwards into each other
Tryna keep our feelings secretly covered
We just dance backwards into each other
(We just keep on dancing)
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
(Right into each other)
You touched me and it's almost like we knew
That there would be history

But there’s no way that it’s not going there

With the way that we’re looking at each other
There’s no way that it’s not going there

Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But there’s no way that it’s not going there

There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

'Cause you still look perfect as days go by

You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em

When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared

You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em

You probably never loved someone like I do"

You SayLauren Daigle,"[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet

If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage

Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks

Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw

UndrunkFLETCHER,"[Intro]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you

[Verse 1]
Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here shoulda gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't wanna face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do? (Haha)
Oh, I'm hungry and wasted and my hands are shaking
I shouldn't be cooking, be spilling hot water
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Bridge]
Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up
Wish I could get a little un-drunk
So I could, I could un-love you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo

What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh

Pick up that jaw off the floor

DamnLivvia,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna calm down
I don't really care what comes out my mouth
And I don't wanna fall out
But ain't nobody safe when the truth comes out
Yeah, how did we become this?
Yelling back and forth
Man, we're such a mess
Maybe this is helpless
I won't stick around till there's nothing left

[Pre-Chorus]
The thing about us
We got problems and we know it
We bottle it up
And we don't deal with our emotions
The thing about us
We're both scared of being lonely
We've been letting it slide by holding inside
The things we wanna say

[Chorus]
When we break up
Damn, gonna hurt real bad
Damn, gonna want you back
Damn, but I won't do that
Wish we could start over, oooh
Damn, no we can't go back
Damn, like a heart attack
Damn, missin' what we had
Wish we could start over, but we can't
(No, we can't, no, we can't)

[Verse 2]
I thought that this was special
I thought you were the one who would change my life
It's really just that simple
Nothing that was wrong ever turned out right
I did everything to please you
I really hate to think it was all a waste
We got too many issues
And what we though we had's gotta be replaced

[Pre-Chorus]
The thing about us
We got problems and we know it
We bottle it up
And we don't deal with our emotions
The thing about us

The things we wanna say

When we break up
Damn, gonna hurt real bad
Damn, gonna want you back
Damn, but I won't do that
Wish we could start over, ooo

Wish we could start over, but we can't
No, we can't, no, we can't (no, we can't)
No, we can't
Oh, damn (oh, damn)

It was all good when we started
We were both so open hearted
We got lost in the darkness

When we break up
Damn, gonna hurt real bad
Damn, gonna want you back
Damn, but I won't do that
Wish we could start over, oooh (Oh, I wish we could)

Pockets empty, wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face
Layin' down on someone's bed
A girl that I had hardly met
My head is spinnin' like I've been out days
Now you're waking up too
Lyin' next to me in your room
Not quite used to someone so new
Did ya catch my name? Yeah
Wonder how long I slept in
I don't know where the hell I've been
I know that's all right

[Chorus: Shaan Singh]
Last night, we met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more

[Verse 2: Shaan Singh]
I got that taste, oh
It's in my mouth it's like I had too much last night
It just felt so right
Because of you, now
I could go or I could stay
'Cause I got nothing planned today
And I know that's all right

[Chorus: Shaan Singh]
Last night, we met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more

Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy when the night's ours?
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy, yeah, so, so easy, oh

[Verse 3: Hailee Steinfeld]
Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home
Pockets empty, wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face
Yeah, last night was fun, let's do it again
We both know we're more than friends
And I know that's all right

[Chorus 3: Both, Hailee Steinfeld,  Shaan Singh]
Last night, we met at one

Bad GuyBillie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

NightmareHalsey,"[Intro]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Bridge]
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?

Love Me LessMAX,"[Intro: MAX]
Would you love me less?
If you knew the places that I've been?
If you knew the damage that I did?
Would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: MAX]
I got too much dirt to come clean
Closets full of skeletons that you don't wanna see
Will you judge me? All my ugly?
I won't blame you if you do
No lies, don't wanna keep no secrets
Even if what I'ma say will you leave speechless
No secrets
If I introduce you to my demons, tell me

[Chorus: MAX]
Baby, would you love me less
If you knew the places that I've been?
If you knew the damage that I did?
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Would you love me less
If I had a dollar for my sins?
If you knew the beds that I've been in?
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Quinn XCII]
I'm happy you never saw me in college
Blood on my hands I refuse to acknowledge
That's why I get light-headed, thin ice that I'm treadin'
Soft conversations in our bed, my skin's sweatin'
She doesn't like my list of exes I've had at home
She's buggin', sounding childish like a xylophone
Knees buckling, hearing that falsetto that's in her tone
If I introduce you to my demons, tell me

[Chorus: MAX, Quinn XCII, & MAX and Quinn XCII]
Baby, would you love me less (Love me less)
If you knew the places that I've been? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you knew the damage that I did? (Damage that I did)
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Now, would you love me? Now, would you love me?)
Would you love me less (Would you love me less?)
If I had a dollar for my sins? (Oh, hey yeah, yeah)
If you knew the beds that I've been in? (Oh, hey yeah, yeah)
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Bridge: MAX & Quinn XCII]
Or would you love me more?
Or would you love me more?
If you knew the person that I was, yeah yeah
If you knew the power of your love to change me
(Oh, hey yeah, yeah)
And if I introduce you to my demons, tell me

[Chorus: MAX, Quinn XCII, & MAX and Quinn XCII]
Baby, you won't love me less (Love me less)
If you knew the places that I've been
(If you knew the places, yeah, yeah)
If you knew the damage that I did? (The trouble that I'm in)
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Now, would you love me?)
Would you love me less (Would you love me less?)
If I had a dollar for my sins?
(Oh, hey yeah, yeah, a dollar for my sins, now)
If you knew the beds that I've been in? (Oh, hey yeah, yeah)
Oh, would you love me less? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"

She looks good in the morning
And she don't even know it
I don't want you to go yet
Can we stay in the moment?

Sundress with you on my arm
Take the coupe out the garage
Pull the roof back, just me, you, and the stars

Got me sprung, wrapped in sheets
Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Uh, me and you on an island
With the ocean color stuck in your iris
We comfortable in silence
But I prefer it when we wilding
Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress (Woo!)

Couple of broken people
Trying to complete each other under one breath

Never Really OverKaty Perry,"[Verse 1]
I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Bridge]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

You Need To Calm DownTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"

I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
It's too late, too late
Baby, I know I'll never find you again

Call You MineThe Chainsmokers,"[Verse 1]
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down
I look at you and you look at me
Like nothing but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah

[Chorus]
You said, ""Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I call you mine

(Ooh, ah, ooh)
Can I call you mine? (Ooh)
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""

Broke kids running through the city
Drunk on the subway train
Set free every time you kissed me
We couldn't feel no pain
You looked at me and I looked at you
Like we'd never look away
Broke kids running through the city
Don't let the memory fade

[Chorus]
You said, ""Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?""

Someone You LovedLewis Capaldi,"[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved"

Goodes',"[Verse 1]
I used to look in the mirror
Felt so uncomfortable
I always felt like I was different from everybody else
I didn't want any attention
I got lost in the crowd
So busy tryna fit in
When I was born to stand out

[Pre-Chorus]
I felt like my best
Wasn't good enough (Wasn't good enough)
But I'm not the same girl
That I once was

[Chorus]
I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry 'bout what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
I'm feeling good

[Verse 2]
If you ever feel like I did
No, it don't have to be that way
'Cause you are perfect the way you are
You shouldn't have to be ashamed
'Cause we are all a work in progress
You gotta work with that you got
Rather be true to myself
Than to be who I'm not

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're unlike anyone else you know
That's what makes you original

[Chorus]
I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry 'bout what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
I'm feeling good

[Bridge]
Let go of who you think that you need to be
You are so much more than what they may see
Let it all out and set it free
Darlin', what you got is all you need
Let go of who you think that you need to be
You are so much more than what they may see
Let it all out and set it free
Darlin', what you got is all you need

[Chorus]
I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry about what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
I'm feeling good"

Summertime and I'm caught in the feeling
Getting high and I'm up on the ceiling
I don't know what you're doing in New York
All I know is you ain't on my bedroom floor

I'm seein' you undressed in my room
But it's just a memory, a fantasy
Are you in your house? Are you going out?
Are you going crazy like me?

One Thing RightMarshmello,"[Verse 1]
I've cheated and I’ve lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I’ve got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door

[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don’t like
Runnin’ with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I’ve been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

(Baby, I got one thing right)
Mmm
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)

You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I changed
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (To walk away)

When I was gettin' crazy, reckless, and wild
Actin' like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (Find its place)

TimeNF,"[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I’m changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin’ like I’m gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing

I just need time (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

Good Things Fall ApartIllenium,"[Verse 1]
Did I say something wrong? Did you hear what I was thinking?
Did I talk way too long when I told you all my feelings that night?
Is it you? Is it me? Did you find somebody better?
Someone who isn't me, 'cause I know that I was never your type
Never really your type

Messing with my head, whoa

Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah

But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

[Verse 2]
When you said it was real, guess I really did believe you
Did you fake how you feel when we parked down by the river that night? That night?
That night when we fogged up the windows in your best friend's car
'Cause we couldn't leave the windows down in December
Whoa

Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Small TalkKaty Perry,"[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens

Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?

Now it's 'bout the weather‚ okay

She was standing outside of the park and ride
And I said, ""Hey ma, where you been?""
""Been looking for a woman like you for all my life""
And she said, ""Hola, talk to me, before I have to leave""

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
Bad At LoveHalsey,"[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines

We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Refrain]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

Too Good At Goodes',"I think I’m in love
But I’ve been feeling otherwise
These flutters in my stomach aren’t butterflies
But cutting knives
And not the butter kind
And if you listen close when she begins to speak
You’ll hear a couple hundred sighs
And the collective shut of eyes
Letters linger on her lips like lullabies
I think I’ve drowned a couple times
Inside her opal-colored eyes
She could do something as simple as sit down
With the grace of Olympic dives
A perfect 10 photo shutter finish on her cocoa butter thighs
Catch her wearing loose pajamas on a sunday
And she’d overshadow any supermodel on a runway
When she wakes up in the morning
She smells like vanilla essence
And the bittersweet recollections of your adolescence
Summer camp and piano lessons
And presents you got on birthdays
Orange creamsicles and double plays on first base
And walk past her in the halls
And if your shoulders feel the slightest brush
Then you might melt to liquid gold
The lightest kind of Midas touch
I’ve seen the way she drinks espresso during classes
And reshapes a paper cup into an emerald-covered chalice
Sugar packets pouring crystals
Napkin origami cranes
Gunning gorgeous glances to me through her Giorgio Armani Frames
She’s nearly perfect in
Almost
Every
Way

But she’s got shit taste in movies
Ask her for her favorite titles
And she always likes to say
She’s down to go see anything by Shyamalan or Michael Bay
And also she’s a psycho in the kitchen - it’s a travesty
What kind of fucking monster cooks their pasta in the microwave
And she does this thing
Where she corrects your grammar if it’s wrong
And clicks her tongue and winks and shoots a playful finger gun
As if she’s won some sorta contest
Empress victor-of-a-conquest
Mrs. armchair shrink
Let me fix you with a comment
Princess kick you when you’re down
Worshiper to a godhead
It seldom happens that she listens to my voice
And doesn’t chime in quick with unsolicited advice
An unapologetic tyrant of passive aggressive rivalry
Ask her a question
And catch and handful of sass and irony
And trust me, really, she is just the worst at board games
Debates about the rules like legislators at a court case
Tampers with the scales of justice
Wielding pencils as her gavel
Once I even caught her cheating while she kept the score in Scrabble
She’s a fucking wreck at checkers
Plays Monopoly sloppily
Always bringing up disputes in games of trivial pursuit
Sucks at Battleship and Risk
She fights better hand-to-hand
And don’t even get me started ‘bout how trash she is at Candy Land

(Like you can't, like you can't be bad at that that game yet you've, you lose all the time. It doesn't make any sense.)

But I’m no adonis either
Fashion sense abysmal, I’ve got two nirvana t-shirts
That I wear to formal outings
And I’ve never owned a cardigan
Catch me buyin’ cargo pants at Target from the bargain bin
Drink milk straight out the carton
Use my hands to scoop out margarine
Breakfast table etiquette makes up our morning arguments
And I’m not a glass half full kinda guy
Shipwrecked, flags half-mast hull kinda guy
I never was an optimist
Not too good at compromise
The problem is my ego’s far too fragile to apologize
But she always calls me out
And takes me down a couple pegs too
It’s always nice to have somebody close who double-checks you
And honestly, we wouldn’t be ourselves if we were different
Yeah, she’s clumsy and I’m stupid
Those are things that we can live with
Being perfect’s unrealistic
Either way I like our flaws
The way I crack my knuckles often
The obnoxious way she yawns
The way I stutter when I flirt
Cause I’m not very good with courtship
The way she’s gotta pee the first ten minutes of a road trip
How when she cuts her pancakes it’s in slices, not in squares
The way my daily coffee intake is a crisis I'm aware
The way I talk in crowded theatre
And the way she parks in parallel
The way she goes through pints of Ben and Jerry's salted caramel"

In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

[Chorus]
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah

I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)

Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game"

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud

I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down

I'm sorry
I'm so sorry now
Yeah, I'm sorry that I let you down"
Feel It StillPortugal. The Man,"[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 1]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 2]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 3]
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls won't bother me

[Bridge]
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Chorus 3]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but I feel it still"
Good Old DaysMacklemore,"[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 3: Macklemore & Kesha]
Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

[Bridge: Kesha]
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days"
Let Me GoHailee Steinfeld,"[Verse 1: Hailee Steinfeld]
You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me, but you always do

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I've been hopin'
Somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of
All of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go

[Post-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping someone will love you, let me go

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
It's been some time, but this time ain't even
I can leave it in the past
But you're holding on to what you never had
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black

Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do

Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go

[Outro: Hailee Steinfeld]
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping someone will love you, let me go"
Too Much To AskNiall Horan,"[Verse 1]
Waiting here for someone
Only yesterday, we were on the run
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
Now I'm waiting here for someone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinking of?

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
To tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?

[Verse 2]
Someone's moving outside
The lights come on down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And oh, love, watch the sun coming up
Don’t it feel fucked up we're not in love?

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
To tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

[Bridge]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
It's all I'm asking

Him & IG-Eazy,"[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true,"" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I

[Verse 1: G-Eazy & Halsey]
My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

[Chorus: Halsey & G-Eazy]
Cross my heart, hope to die (Uh)
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you baby)
He said, ""Be true,"" I swear I'll try

He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah

Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I

[Verse 2: G-Eazy & Halsey]
We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true,"" I swear I'll try

I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

In the end, it's him and I

Cross my heart, hope to die
To you, I've never lied
For you, I'd take a life
It's him and I, and I swear (Ayy)
'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you
Mob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah (Ayy)
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die
You can confide in me
There's not no hiding, I swear
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah

[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said, “Be true,” I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

[Post-Chorus: Halsey]
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah

Best FriendSofi Tukker,"[Intro: Sofi Tukker]

One FootWALK THE MOON,"[Verse 1]
Not a soul up ahead
And nothing behind
There's a desert in my blood
And a storm in your eyes
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all

Well, I remember the fight
And I forget the pain
I got my hand in your pocket
And my key on your chain
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, through the wilderness
You and I we're walking
Through the emptiness
Oh, my heart is a mess
Is it the only defense
Against the wilderness

[Chorus]
Cross my heart
And hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

[Verse 2]
Not a soul in the road
Not a star in the sky
It's a desert in my heart
And I know where to hide
I'm your king of nothing at all
And you're my queen of nothing at all

Well, out here in the dust
If you don't have trust
Ain't nothing left of us
This is the exodus
They're just testing us
They can't flex with us
They can't mess with us
They can't mess with us

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together
There can be loneliness?
Oh, our heart's a mess
But it's our only defense
To brave the wilderness

[Chorus]
Cross my heart
And hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other
In the so-called land of the free
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other"
...Ready For It?Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Faking ItCalvin Harris,"[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself

Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?

Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?

I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Why you holding me?
Why you holding me?

Oh, she killed that shit
She was killing it, that was hard, bruh
I didn't know she could get that high but she killed that

We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far

But man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh

RiverEminem,"[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)

""I'll hold her down, don't you worry, we'll find a way
No matter how, I'll make sure the bills get paid""
She gave it all and thank God their mouths got fed
She prayed the cycle would end

[Pre-Chorus]
When everything around us starts to fall
We rise up again to the call

[Chorus]
We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little

[Bridge]
Sometimes when you feel like you need it
They send in the medic, woah
But if it's your soul that is bleeding
That slow drip won't help it, no
It's time to get up to the front of the line
The guards of the battle and straight for the mind
Well, well, well, well
There's nothing that's holding you down
Stuck on the ground, far from the crown
'Cause you are a warrior more than you know

[Chorus]
We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little (A little, a little )
A little"
Reggaeton Lento (Bailemos)CNCO,"[Verso 1: Erick & Christopher]
Qué bien se ve
Me trae loco su figura
Ese trajecito corto le queda bien
Combinado con su lipstick color café
Qué bien se ve
Me hipnotiza su cintura
Cuando baila hasta los dioses la quieren ver
Ya no perderé más tiempo, me acercaré

[Coro: Todo]
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: “Bailemos, eh?”
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: “Bailemos, eh?”
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo

Permíteme bailar contigo esta pieza
Entre todas las mujeres se resalta tu belleza
Me encanta tu firmeza, te mueves con destreza
Muévete, muévete, muévete
Muy rica, latina, estás llena de vida
Sube las dos manos, dale pa´ arriba
¿Dónde están las solteras y las que no, también?
Sin miedo muévete, muévete, muévete

Come get - come get some more

[Verso 3: Zadbiel & Joel]
Es imposible atrasar las horas
Cada minuto contigo es un sueño
Quisiera ser su confidente
¿Por qué no te atreves si lo hacemos ahora?
No te pongas tímida
Estamos tú y yo a solas

Look What You Made Me DoTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time

Beautiful TraumaP!nk,"[Verse 1]
We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause
Mmm, tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, (oh) my love, my drug, we're fucked up

[Verse 2]
You punched a hole in
The wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing
That holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
Blow out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'Cause these tough
Times they keep comin'
Last night
I might have messed it up again
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
But after we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

SilenceMarshmello,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (Fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh
And all this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

[Verse 2]
I'm in need of a savior (Savior), but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na"
Walk On WaterThirty Seconds To Mars,"[Intro]
(Do you believe?) Walk on water

[Verse 1]
Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Blood lust and a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
""Times are changing""
In the end, the choice was clear
Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

[Chorus]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe?)

[Verse 2]
Look at the sky, see a dying star
White lies, it's a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts
Times are changing
A thin line, the whole truth
The far right, the left view
Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing

[Chorus]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

[Bridge]
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water

[Chorus]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?

Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?

Ohh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still runnin', dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

Pray For MeThe Weeknd,"[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Everybody says, ""say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
I don't wanna get caught, up in the rhythm of it

You know how I like it when you lovin' on me

Whatever It TakesImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"

You so fuckin' precious when you smile
Hit it from the back and drive you wild

I just had to let you know you're mine

Swear to God I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright

No RootsAlice Merton,"[Verse 1]
I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground

But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots

I like standing still but that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Verse 4]
I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

I've got no roots

To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)
There's nothin you could tell me, I rocked every hole in the wall

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
And who you know get out of jail and get them figures
Get back into the game like f**k the system
Hit the studio and bless y'all with Fatty Girl
Who got 'em sayin ba donk a donk around the world
Now I'm hearin I got anger issues on the street
The only anger I got, is when I'm f**kin up a E beat
Keep runnin your lips and I'm a have you dancin like the crips
Turn your six pack to some barbeque rib tips
Mother hot damn this man jam like a phone
And plus the shit I get more draws than a dresser
When I flow, there's no one deafer

Make you make the ugly face like Lamont's Aunt Ester
You can't stealth me my tank is too healthy
Even negative situations help me
When E lace the beat, and me and Ty bust one
Trust son that's money in the bank like a trust fund

[Chorus: Tyrese]

Yo! Keith Murray is your excellency MC Ultra
With the sickest comeback like nigga I told ya
Honeys sweat me like conversation, mind affiliation
House niggas like the Fannie Mae Foundation
The K don't play f**k around touche' and toupee
What you say get done away like Faye
I rhyme flagrant you sweeter than a sugar fragrance
Ignoramus, blow your brains out on a pavement
The game we been milkin for awhile like a green cow
You seregant MC, that ain't your style
Metaphors dawn on you in time like revelations
Battlin Keith, self mutilation
Let it be sensible, I'll make you invisible
Niggas can't see me the flow is invincible
My style royalty like residuals
You subjectable, hospitable y'all niggas is despicable

[Chorus: Tyrese]
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)

Yeah yeah yeah!!! No doubt (I like the way this feels right here!!!)
It's classical baby (Make me wanna get on the freeway you know in the fast lane)"
On The LooseNiall Horan,"[Verse 1]
I know what she's like, she's out of her mind
And wraps herself around the truth
She'll jump on that flight and meet you that night
And make you tear up the room

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)

She'll dance in the dark, a real work of art
Her eyes could burn down the room
So get out while you can, you don't understand
She doesn't know how to lose

She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

And now I'm just warning you

She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you
She loves when everybody's watching

She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
She loves nobody else but you

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing

Does it ever?

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done

So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol

Want You Back5 Seconds Of Summer,"[Verse 1: Luke]
Can't help but wondering if this
Is the last time that I'll see your face
Is it tears or just the fucking rain?
Wish I could say something
Something that doesn't sound insane
But lately, I don't trust my brain
You tell me I won't ever change
So I just say nothing

And no matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone

Want you back

I remember the freckles on your back
And the way that I used to make you laugh

Yeah, I still reach for you
I remember the roses on your shirt
When you told me this would never work
You know, even when I say I moved on
Yeah, I still dream for you

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, ""Shit, this is it,"" ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
And I can't ever tell you no

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums

Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

Sit Next To MeFoster The People,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, it’s over, it’s over, I’m circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said “What’s up?” and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you but we’re always on the move
And now it’s over, we’re sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain’t getting younger, last call’s around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted and I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers ‘cause now all I want is you
Just sayin’

Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high

Well, I ain’t frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop

High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense
You already had them
Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (Alright!)
It's a short life

Uh-huh! (Oh yeah!)
These hoes! (They mad!)
Your boy! (I had!)
I made! (Watch the breakdown)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

[Breakdown: Drake]
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta, gotta, gotta g-g-gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta
Gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta, gotta make that jump, jump (Let's go)
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, over, over, over, over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, lift it up (Make that jump, jump)
Bend it over, lift it up (Make that jump, jump)

[Refrain: Drake]
That's a real one in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta be nice for what to these niggas?
I understand

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd cry for me

[Outro: Drake & Lauryn Hill]
Gotta hit the club like you hit them, hit them, hit them angles
It's a short life, yeah
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?"

These DaysRudimental,"[Intro: Macklemore]
I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

[Verse 1: Dan Caplen]
Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

[Post-Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days

[Verse 2: Dan Caplen & Jess Glynne]
Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk, remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
To these days, these days, oh

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days"
Tattoo (How 'Bout You)In Real Life,"[Verse 1: Chance Perez]
Called you up this time, I thought I'd be your shelter
You left me standing at your door
Kept you off my mind last weekend, but it felt worse
Now I'm back outside once more

[Pre-Chorus: Drew Ramos]
'Cause I like the rhythms you play
Melodies making me sway, wanted some more
We were the talk of the day
Should've been up on the stage, not on the floor
Something just pulled you away
Happened in front of my face, what's all of this for?
I'm still feeling the same

[Chorus: Sergio Calderon, with Brady Tutton]
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I'd hate to have to change this tattoo too
Yeah, I like the rhythms you play
Melodies making me sway, wanted some more
We were the talk of the day
Should've been up on the stage
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh

[Verse 2: Brady Tutton &  Chance Perez]
Always seem to have a question for your answers
How could you act so carelessly? Ayy
Your reasons don't add up, you're such a little actor
So give you all my thoughts for free (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Drew Ramos, with Chance Perez]
'Cause I like the rhythms you play

Should've been up on the stage
How 'bout you, (how 'bout you?) you
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Conor]
I'm, cuttin' all my distractions
No tats 'cause, baby, I don't want no attachments
Maybe this is perfect and I'm overreacting
Or maybe I'm just missing something I haven't had yet
How 'bout you?
You really think that we could work together
But if it don't last, you're gonna hurt forever
You say maybe we should give it a chance, cancel our plans
I really hope that you understand, it's like

SoberG-Eazy,"[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth & (G-Eazy)]
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo (you know)
Oooo-oooo ooo (story of my fucking life, haha)
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Eazy
Uh, yeah, I might regret this when tomorrow comes
But, them drunk nights are more fun than sober ones
With every shot, they're like ""Aw, here Kobe comes!""
But I got this bad bitch tryna to throw me buns
If I listened to my Uncs, all them older ones
They all talk about karma, how it slowly comes (uh)
But, life is short, enjoy it while you're young
Spend my bank account tonight and have to borrow funds
It all started with a light glass
Now I'm asking ""How long could tonight last?""
Man, she had an eeh face with a tight ass
If I had a shot less, then I might pass
But, I'm faded and I got a little sedated
I can't believe we made it, every night we celebrate it
I live like Jim Morrison, no telling where I'll take it
I take her to my room and I tell her ""Get naked""

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I slipped up with my ex and I smashed again
Stayed over, now she's about to get attached again
Walls built up around, they come crashing in
Passed out at 6 A.M., but she's up at 10
Doing this was not in my plans
She got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
Hoop earrings, some bitch left on my nightstand
Cussed me out and stormed off like ""Alright then"" (uh)
On both sides, that was bad for 'em
Why do people do things that be bad for 'em?
Say we done with these things, then we ask for 'em
When the sun comes down, then we transform
Yeah, you can probably bet this
By this time tomorrow, I'll probably regret this
Try, but it all falls down like Tetris
No telling where an 80 proof gets us

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over"
Back To YouSelena Gomez,"[Verse 1]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge]
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

PraySam Smith,"[Verse 1]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 2]
You won't find me in church (No)
Readin' the Bible (No)
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

Pray for a glimmer of hope

Your chicken all on my girl, she thick with all of her curves
Plus she got a mind on her
Street smart, book smart, built by design for me
Gotta hold her up, 'cause she always holding me down
Like a bank robber with a note, give it to the teller
So she know we ain't fucking around
It's something 'bout that company
I send for you if you come for me
Come for me

[Chorus]
If it's all right
I wanna kick it with you all night, all night
Have a good time
Ain't gotta worry 'cause it's all right, it's all right
All night and all night and all night, baby
Don't be shy, don't be shy, don't be shy, baby
All night and all night
Ain't gotta worry 'cause it's all right, it's all right

[Verse 2]
It's alright, it's okay
I been feeling good, now a nigga feeling great
Started out as a little hood nigga from Savannah
Then I moved to the A (Aye!)
Dirty, dirty, see we grew up on Vogues and 30s
Sucking up game like a WetVac
Put it out, eat it up, get it right back
They ain't worthy, sometimes I think they don't deserve me
Big cold as the ice in your night cap
Hit you with your bonnet on by the night-lamp
We don't discriminate, we just want you to participate
It takes two to tango, now where the day go?
This ain't that same old, same old, old same shit
We done switched it up like a plain clothes
5-0, 12: same code, my flow? Hell, stay froze
It's something 'bout that company
I send for you if you come for me
Come for me

[Chorus]
If it's all right
I wanna kick it with you all night, all night
Have a good time
Ain't gotta worry 'cause it's all right, it's all right
All night and all night and all night, baby
Don't be shy, don't be shy, don't be shy, baby
All night and all night
Ain't gotta worry 'cause it's all right, it's all right

I have listened to this
Listened to shit from a player
You get no love

Don't do this to me, nightmare
You got a nice face, big deal
Don't want what you got right here

Do I have to say it?
Say it again, again?

[Chorus]
I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like but it's never gon' change
So you do what you want, what you wanna do

Drew BarrymoreBryce Vine,"[Verse 1]
I want this forever
Just you in the grotto
With nothin' but your nights on
Keep the fuckin' lights on
Same again tomorrow
We don't need no bottle
Purple color lip-gloss
Room at The Saguaro
Ain't nowhere I would rather be
Right between your holidays
Coffee on the flintstone
Jewelry on the ottoman
Baby, let me in, oh
For I get way too adamant about it
Love the way you shiver
Dig in to my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Harrelson and Juliette
Legends never die
The TV hasn't worked in ages
Probably got a shorted cable
Way too busy fuckin' on the sofa or the kitchen table
Is my vision hazy?
You look like you're someone famous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah (Barry)
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for

[Verse 2]
'Cause you're something like the summer
Kinda like a hurricane
Sweepin' through the desert
Hot Americana rain fallin'
Wearing nothing but my Lauryn Hill shirt
It's kinda baggy on you, baby, but it work
The AC hasn't worked in ages
I could probably read the label
Way too busy fuckin' on the counter or the coffee table
Am I hallucinating?
Why do you look hella famous?

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah (Barry)
And I want more (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for

I wanna make
Every single moment for you great
Fly away to Cairo or LA
Girl, I want it now, don't wanna waste time, waste time
I wanna make, yeah
Every single moment for you great, yeah
Fly away to Cairo or LA
Girl, I want it now, don't wanna waste time, waste time

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for

Growing PainsAlessia Cara,"[Intro]
You're on your own, kid
You are

[Verse 1]
Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad, ""Now, don't you overreact""
So I just hold my breath
Don't know why I can't see the sun when young should be fun

[Pre-Chorus]
And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

[Verse 2]
Try to mend what's left of my content incomprehension
As I take on the stress of the mess that I've made
Don’t know if I even care for ""grown"" if it's just alone, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

[Outro]
Starting to look like Ms. Know-It-All can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
No band-aids for the growing pains (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
No, no, no band-aids for the growing pains"

Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget

LieNF,"[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us (Woo)
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night
Then, tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no, I'm the one that made you rich
When I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us
So I guess I don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours of the night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 2]
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah, that we was barely speakin'
Ah, that's kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend
Tellin' me you missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me, ""We should let it go and put it all behind us""
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk—then why you callin', huh?

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Bridge]
How you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
Baby, how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie, baby, how you gonna lie like that?
No, no, how you gonna lie like that?

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
(Baby, how you gonna lie like that? No, no)
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
(Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that)
You say all I ever do is just control your life
(No, no, no)
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
(Oh, yeah)

[Outro]
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like—
Yeah, yeah, hey"

[Intro: V, Jungkook]
널 위해서라면 난
슬퍼도 기쁜 척 할 수가 있었어
널 위해서라면 난
아파도 강한 척 할 수가 있었어

내 모든 약점들은 다 숨겨지길
이뤄지지 않는 꿈속에서
피울 수 없는 꽃을 키웠어

세상을 줬네 just for you
전부 바꿨어 just for you
Now I don't know me, who are you?
우리만의 숲 너는 없었어
내가 왔던 route 잊어버렸어
나도 내가 누구였는지도 잘 모르게 됐어
거울에다 지껄여봐 너는 대체 누구니

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me"

I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. What-Kind-of-Car-He-In?
And the city love my name, nigga, I ain't gotta say it

[Chorus: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste

Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me
Nigga, get your ass checked like a fuckin' Nike
Me not icy, that's unlikely
And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline
I'm the black JB, the way these bitches scream
Make these bitches scream
Ah, pretty little thing
Like my nigga A.E.
Say, ""Yadadadamean""

[Chorus: Tyga & Offset]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), fuck what a nigga say

3400 Nawfside, Charles Barkley (Nawf)

Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley (Ride)
She wanna keep me company and never wan' depart me, depart me (No)
Yeah, fishtail in the parking lot (Skrrt, skrrt)
I don't kick it with these niggas 'cause they talk about ya (Yeah)

I'm rich in real life, I get that profit, copy (Hey)

[Chorus: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), let you get a taste

Goode',"[Verse 1]
I gave you all of me
But it still ain't enough to make you happy
I gave you everything
It still don't measure up
It feels like I walked 5 thousand miles
And didn't even come close
Feels like I try to make you smile
But you don't even care, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But i keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I got to do?

[Chorus]
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that i can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough

[Verse 2]
I try to show you that I'm strong
Why do I even bother?
Cause it's the same old damn song
And you call yourself a father
Feels like I'm reaching for the stars
But heaven isn't letting me
I wish that I had longer arms
But I know that will never be never be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But i keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I got to do?

I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be

[Bridge]
Look at me
I'm standing right here waiting for you, here I am
Look at me
Lookin' for your acceptance, do you give a damn?
Look at me
See it doesn't matter what you think, I'm still a man
Look at me
Open up your eyes, can't you see that I'm good enough

[Chorus]
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough

AfricaWeezer,"[Verse 1]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Verse 2]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have"
One DayLogic,"[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow, dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be— alright

[Verse 1: Logic]
You ever wonder what it means to make it by any means and finally attain your dreams?
On the come up, where they run up from the world of many fiends
I been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream
Hard work and sacrifice but not a lot know what I mean
Most these rappers ain't got no class like bomb threats
And bein' ill is a disease, it's the onset
And it don't matter where you at, if you white or if you black
If you rich or you poor, we gon' always want more
But one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor
I'ma use this power to paint a picture of unity
And yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like it's two of me
Fuck the lights and the cameras, right now it's just you and me

[Refrain 1: Logic & Ryan Tedder]
One day (one day), I'll be richer than I was before
One day (one day), I'm 'gon have enough money to buy the store
One day (one day),
Like Sinatra said you know I'm finna do it my way
You on the road to success, I took the highway

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow, dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be— alright

[Verse 2: Logic]
Feelin' blessed like I'm at mass, yeah, I'm comin' for that ass
Game been broken for too long, so I guess I am the cast
Left my Section 8 crib, finally found some greener grass
So ahead of my time, I wasn't born in the past
This right here a double-header with Logic and Ryan Tedder
Oh no, it can't get no better
And you know, we know we do it for the children
I never thought I'd see the day I made a million
Couple dozen later, feel like everybody feel 'em
I ain't mean to boast in that last line
But countin' money's always been my favorite pastime
Especially with a past like mine
Drugs in the household, never had a hand to hold
Even when I was homeless in the blisterin' cold, but I made it out
And if I can, you can, no doubt, I know—

[Refrain 2: Logic & Ryan Tedder]
(One day) I'ma do it like I never did it
(One day) I'ma have the courage to go out and get it
(One day) Do what I love and support my girl
(One day) I'ma shake up the whole world

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow, dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be alright

[Bridge: Ryan Tedder]
(One day)
Everybody tryna kill my light
Only thing I know it's gonna be alright (one day)
Everybody tryna kill my light
Only thing I know it's gonna be alright (one day)
Keep tryna tell myself in the morning things will be better (one day)
I keep tryna tell myself that tomorrow's different weather

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be farther from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow, dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be–"

Song About YouMike Posner,"[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Since you've been gone, ain't got nothin' to do
I sleep until noon, I wake up and feel bad
I think I miss somethin' I never had
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Yeah, yeah
All your love letters and a pair of Ray-Bans
I'm growin' my beard, movin' back in my van
And your side of the bed still smells like you though
And these memories of us, it's brutal
You know, you know exactly how I feel
We broke up, but you be on my mind still
And the worst type of sadness you could have
Is when you miss somethin' that doesn't miss you back

Put all your stuff in a box in my room (Room)
I don't wanna write no song about you (You)
But you show up in everything that I do (Do)

Yeah, come just eat me and throw me away
If I'm not your taste, babe, waste
Waste it on me

And I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh, yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

[Chorus: Jungkook, RM & Jimin]
Waste it on me, waste it on me

Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me

Scars To Your BeautifulAlessia Cara,"[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

Bad ThingsMachine Gun Kelly x Camila Cabello,"CABELLO KICKED OFF HER SOLO CAREER AND HER BAND SISTERS IN FIFTH HARMONY UNEXPECTEDLY DENOUNCED HER FOR IT. NOW SHE’S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE, A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: “YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE”.

CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city’s center.

As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.

Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.

Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).

But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.

She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.

“It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”

But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.

“You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”

The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.)

Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.

The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.

Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.

Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.

Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.

Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.

But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance).

She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants, and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.”

After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.”

“The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.

“I mean, [we were] at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But, she says, “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!”

The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career, despite the grueling schedule.

Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life, so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant, she would be in the studio’s gym, writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and, in time, arenas.

“I would wake up super early,” says Cabello, “get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.”

So she was basically singing into the toilet?

“Yep.”

“She has done her 10,000 hours,” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.”

But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.

When I ask her about it, Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:

*When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*

I don’t know. I was always super open [that] I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.

*Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*

I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it’s because of this thing or [another] thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.

*Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*

No.

*Have you reached out directly?*
I did, yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.

*When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like, “What’s happening?”*

I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.

Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún.

“The first four days were trippy,” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!”

Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.

Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.

“My parents worked really hard,” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.”

(Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)

Cabello’s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.

She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like, ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,’ ” which she is. “I went [to clubs], and I was like, ‘I don’t love this.’ ”

After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.”

Mainly, Cabello’s focused on making music.

Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.

She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016.

Romantically speaking, says Cabello, “I don’t have anything going on right now,” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.)

And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:

“I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.”

A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples.

“I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel, who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.

“It’s a real collaboration,” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.”

The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever,” she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One,” all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.

They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.”

“Camila is an incredible songwriter,” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.”

Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante.

Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time, and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.

Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line, “I ain’t worried about nothing,” and punctuated it with a full stop.

“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist, that’s success.”

In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello.

“I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that,” she tells me this time around.

Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.

“It’s so hard to hear that,” says Cabello, lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective, like, ‘Damn, poor girl.’ ”

She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this [conflict] doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this.

“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me, if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart, that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean, isn’t that the goal?”

If Cabello is anxious now, it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together,” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t:

“We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”"

Heathenstwenty one pilots,"[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Stocked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 2]
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

[Outro]
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside ready to bust (To bust) (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us"
This TownNiall Horan,"[Verse 1]
Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 2]
I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Bridge]
And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you"

Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken

An example of the perfect candidate
Now, all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

I, (I, I) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken

Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made

I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""

Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go

There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo

I upgrade your baby mama to a condo

15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated

You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet

Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me

You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy

Just that you're honest with me

Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart

In the darkness, in the middle of the night
In the silence, when there's no one by your side
Would you call in the name of love?

If I told you we could bathe in all the lights
Would you rise up, come and meet me in the sky?
Would you trust me when you're jumping from the heights?
Would you fall in the name of love?
When there's madness, when there's poison in your head
When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed
I will hold you in the depths of your despair
And it's all in the name of love

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

[Breakdown: Bebe Rexha]
In the name of
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name, name
Love

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha]
I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love
I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

[Breakdown: Bebe Rexha]
In the name of
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name, name

In the name of

In the name, name

In the name of

I Feel It ComingThe Weeknd,"[Intro: The Weeknd]
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Tell me what you really like

'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you

You just got to let me try
To give you what you want

Water Under The BridgeAdele,"[Verse 1]
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

[Outro]
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge"
Love Me NowJohn Legend,"[Verse 1]
Pulling me further, further than I've been before
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart

[Chorus]
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

[Chorus]
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
And I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now

Guys My AgeHey Violet,"[Verse 1]
Haven't seen my ex since we broke up
Probably cause he didn't wanna grow up
Now I'm out and wearing something low-cut
'Bout to get attention from a grown up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you hold me like a woman
In a way I've never felt before
And it makes me wanna hold on
And it makes me wanna be all yours

[Chorus]
Guys my age don't know how to treat me

What we supposed to do with all his friends around, yeah
Smoking weed, he'd never wanna leave the house
Got an empty cushion on that sofa now

Told him good luck with the next one
Maybe she'll be just as immature
Gotta thank him, he's the reason
That I know now what I'm looking for

You're Not ThereLukas Graham,"[Verse 1]
I only got you in my stories
And you know I tell them right
I remember you and I, when I'm awake at night
So give it up for fallen glory
I never got to say goodbye
I wish I could ask for just a bit more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step I take, you used to lead the way
Now I'm terrified to face it on my own

[Chorus]
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Isn't fair
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me

[Verse 2]
Though I know that you're not there
I still write you all these songs
It's like, you got the right to know what's going on
As I struggle to remember how you used to look and sound
At times I still think I can spot you in the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step I take, you used to lead the way
Now I'm terrified to face it on my own

[Chorus]
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Isn't fair
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me

[Bridge]
Time can heal your wounds if
You're strong and standing tall
I've been doing all of that, it didn't help at all
They say, ""You'll grow older, and it'll get better still""
Yes, I will, but no, it won't
They don't get it, 'cause

[Chorus]
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Isn't fair
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me"

Million ReasonsLady Gaga,"[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware

It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy

But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay"

Days when
We'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in
Yeah, perfect disasters
We were reaching, reaching for the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
And on most of the days we were searching for ways
To get up and get out of the town that we were raised, yeah, Cause we were done
I remember, we were sleeping in cars
We were searching for OZ
We were burning cigars
With white plastics tips 'til we saw the sun
And we said crazy things like

[Chorus]
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we’ll never die

[Verse 2]
Lights down
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out
Yeah, perfect disasters
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, we were dancing in cars
We were looking for ours
We were naming the stars
After people we knew 'til we had to go
And we were saying things like

I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

[Bridge]
Nights when we kept dancing
Changing all our plans and
Making every day a holiday
Feel the years start burning
City lights they're turning
Something 'bout this feels the same

[Chorus]
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we’ll never change

You and me were kids"

Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego

Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

I've only been around for, like
Two and a half years, really, doing this music thing, but
I've been around long enough to be able to tell the ones
Who are actually serious about this
Than the ones who just think they serious about this
But I'm letting y'all know, though
I gave my life to this, brandUn DeShay

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
I feel like these rappers really dinner than me
Killing tracks, it's the sinner in me
I feel like it's another nigga living in me
How the hell I'm supposed to sleep when I'm living the dream?
Make tracks like that, rap infinitely
Funny thing: I'm not a rapper, coincidentally
Aw, let them hear that, of course they gonna hate
Niggas wouldn't crack a smile with a porcelain face
Finally blacking out like the pores on my face
It's important to wait, F that, I'm impa...tient
I've got to bring light to the truth
Like back to the booth, like back to the fu...ture
Church, apocalypse, hand full of pocket lint
I ain't got scratch, so I got to itch
Y'all dudes blowing money like you guys rich
No, y'all blowing money like y'all got a dick

[Chorus (4x): brandUn DeShay]
You think you're gonna get it, but I know I got it
I don't even got to be modest, honest

[Verse 2: Ev4n Holt]
Before I even started rapping, I was destined to be [?]
[?] just a bad emcee
Better than most of these niggas, don't compare them to me
Unless they sold a million records or a legend-to-be
But that ain't happening 'cause niggas barely make it to three
I talk a hundred and you niggas pushing units for free
I'm selling mines out the backpack
Where admirations in making millions and talking on the all-red Blackjack
But past that, I'm trying to be in the office
Calling my own shots, not a regular artist
Up in the big screen, looking like Denzel
You know who I am, bitch, I'm Mr. All Hail
This nigga made it from nothing, a dollar and a dream
And turning after the sun is harder than it seem
My heart is still in the gutter, I do it for my fam
So I whip and flip shit like a thousand eight grams

[Chorus (8x): brandUn DeShay]

[Sample (7x)]
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on"

Shape Of YouEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

ParisThe Chainsmokers,"[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Break: Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris (If we go down)

Dancing On My OwnCalum Scott,"[Verse 1]
Somebody said you got a new friend

Chained To The RhythmKaty Perry,"[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars

The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song

ColdMaroon 5,"[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant (Oh), when we're kissing (Yeah)
Feel so different (Yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones

I don't understand why you're so cold to me

Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world

So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold"

Something Just Like ThisThe Chainsmokers,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody

Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine

Guess I need you, and I need to

We can stay forever young

Say You Won't Let GoJames Arthur,"[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Outro]
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
HeavyLinkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I don’t like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 2: Kiiara]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

[Chorus: Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything’s about me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?"

Well those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you

Brand new sounds in my mind

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Somewhere in the world
There is a father and a mother
And the father is a son, who has a mother
The mother has a daughter
Who gets married to the brother of a mother
And they all just tryna multiply with one another

Somewhere in the world
You got a robber and a bank
And the bank robbed the people
So the people rob the bank
And the police came to get him, but they let him get away
'Cause they're all just working to get paid the very same

It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again

Don't believe everything that you hear
Let it go through your left and right ear
Don't just march to the beat of that drum
Don't be one of them people just twiddlin' them thumbs

It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again (Start again)

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark

It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah

If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average (M's)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrr)

Scared To Be LonelyMartin Garrix,"[Verse 1]
It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

[Chorus]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

[Verse 2]
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

[Pre-Chorus]
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more

[Chorus]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely

Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see, you see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, whoa...
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: KYLE]
I ain't been gettin' high
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters (Facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (Facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: KYLE]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

She said she 21, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Sign Of The TimesHarry Styles,"[Verse 1]

You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

Castle On The HillEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"
At My BestMachine Gun Kelly,"[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Turn my vocals up, alright

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...
Aight check this out

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Life is about makin' mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly + Hailee Steinfeld]
This song's for anybody
Who feels like I did, never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through, always remained true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it, the one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ohh, I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared

I Love YouAxwell,"[Chorus: Madison Love]

We got really high highs, really low lows
But I still love you, even though I don't like you right now

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I was tryna save us
But you got me lookin' like the villain
I had a couple mixed drinks
Now I got a couple mixed feelings
I love it, I love it
You know just how to fit in that dress
Then, I don't like it, I don't like it
Wish they had a button for your Instagram pic
We argue about this and that when
You say you need a different address
Break up to make up, hit the mattress
Wake up and you don't remember half of
The whole lotta games that we played
I ain't afraid to say when I'm wrong
And you ain't afraid to dance how you want
When your favorite song is on

[Chorus: Madison Love]
I love you, even though I don't like you right now
I want you, even though you keep breaking me down
We got really high highs, really low lows
But I still love you, even though I don't like you right now

You ain't gotta say nothin', you ain't gotta say nothin'
I already know why you trippin'
I ain't had nothin' to do with them bitches
So you ain't gotta say nothin'
Six inch heel when she bust in
Should've seen my face when she rushed in
Throwin' purses, make-up and brushes

I, I can't keep it aside
Loving with caution, caution
No, I can't see you tonight
But 2AM, I might be calling, calling

I want you, even though you keep breaking me down
We got really high highs, really low lows
But I still love you, even though I don't like you right now

The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy
(¡D.Y.!) Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh!
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (¡Oh, yeah!)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Estribillo: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube)

[Post-Estribillo: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Estribillo: Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

MalibuMiley Cyrus,"[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

[Outro]
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu"
Bad LiarSelena Gomez,"[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Verse 2]
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

Body Like A Back RoadSam Hunt,"[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Outro]
I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Got braids in her hair"
Humble.Kendrick Lamar,"[Intro]
Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy

I will not forget
All the wonderful things you've done

I wanna feel the pain
I wanna see the light

Yo me arrepiento de esta relación todo te lo di
Tremendo problema te juro que no lo vi
Ok me dormí, pero ya lo decidí
El golpe fue duro te juro que morí (estoy arrepentido)
Se acabó todo, me echaste en el lodo (duro duro)
Mi amor es oro y tú lo tiras por el inodoro
Par de días te ignoro, pero a veces empeoro
Todo lo que siento, lo resume este coro

You got everything to give right now

Can we be friends?

[Pre-Chorus]
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good

[Chorus]
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (Ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (Ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (Ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?"
PrayingKesha,"[Verse 1]
Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, but after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become

[Pre-Chorus]
’Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin’, prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'

[Verse 2]
I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own, oh
And I don't need you, I found a strength I’ve never known
I’ll bring thunder, I'll bring rain, oh-oh
When I’m finished, they won't even know your name

[Pre-Chorus]
You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin’, prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'

[Bridge]
Oh, sometimes I pray for you at night
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
But some things only God can forgive

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'"
GloriousMacklemore,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like ""Woo, that boy got bars""
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious"

All these rumors bein' spreaded

Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you

Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged

I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal

Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide in
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

WhySabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't, I need it on
You like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't, I sing along

I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change

Tell me how we're not alike

They believe it so I guess it must be real

HoodieHey Violet,"[Verse 1]
You'd probably think I was psychotic (If you knew)
What I still got in my closet (Sad but true)
I slip it all over my shoulders
Something I'll never get over
It makes me feel a little bit closer to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep your love, I can't keep your kiss
Gave you everything and all I got was this

[Chorus]
I'm still rocking your hoodie and chewing on the strings
It makes me think about you, so I wear it when I sleep
I kept the broken zipper and cigarette burns
Still rocking your hoodie, baby, even though it hurts
Still rocking your...

[Verse 2]
I used to put my hand in your pockets (Holding on)
The smell of your cologne still on it (But you're still gone)
Slip it on over my shoulders
Someone I'll never get over
Makes me feel a little bit closer to you

I can't keep your love, I can't keep your kiss
Gave you everything and all I got was this


[Chorus]
I'm still rocking your hoodie and chewing on the strings
It makes me think about you, so I wear it when I sleep
I kept the broken zipper and cigarette burns
Still rocking your hoodie, baby, even though it hurts
Still rocking your hoodie and chewing on the strings
It makes me think about you, so I wear it when I sleep
I kept the broken zipper and cigarette burns
Still rocking your hoodie, baby, even though it hurts
Still rocking your...

I'm here waiting
Come take it back, come take it back
If you want it back, if you want it back
I'm here waiting
Come take it back, come take it back

I'm still rocking your hoodie and chewing on the strings
It makes me think about you, so I wear it when I sleep

Still rocking your hoodie, baby, even though it hurts
I'm still rocking your hoodie and chewing on the strings
It makes me think about you, so I wear it when I sleep
I kept the broken zipper and cigarette burns
Still rocking your hoodie, baby, even though it hurts
I'm still rocking your hoodie and chewing on the strings
It makes me think about you, so I wear it when I sleep (Every time I sleep)
I kept the broken zipper and cigarette burns
Still rocking your hoodie, baby, even though it hurts
I'm still rocking your hoodie (Hoodie, hoodie, hoodie)"
Two GhostsHarry Styles,"[Verse 1]
Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Verse 2]
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Telling those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat"

Yeah, if I could go back to that day we met
I probably would just stay in bed
You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound
Of breaking glass on my Range Rover
Pay me back or bitch, it's over

Fuck my friends behind my shoulder

Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments your make-up bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody want to tap that ass sometime

Find YouNick Jonas,"[Verse 1]
I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you
I chase the words that keep falling out your mouth
You got a logic I'll never figure out
If I could hold you then I'd never put you down
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you

[Verse 2]
You think you know how to get under my skin
It's good for now but it's never permanent
Knock on the door but there's no one listening
And I never really know just where to find you
You look for love but you never really try
You say it's not but it's always on your mind
Keep chasing gold but you lose a silver line
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm chasing a feeling
Maybe I don't even need it
Maybe you're looking for me tonight, tonight
I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you"

And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here"
On My MindEllie Goulding,"[Intro]
Oh, oh
Uh-oh-oh-oh
Eh

[Verse 1]
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

[Chorus 1]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

[Verse 2]
I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

[Chorus 2]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind

[Bridge]
You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it
Understand it, understand it

[Chorus 3]
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind

Like I'm Gonna Lose YouMeghan Trainor,"[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]
I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted

When we'll run out of time

I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey), any chance that I get

Let's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want)
Use what we got before it's all gone (Oh no)

In The NightThe Weeknd,"[Verse 1]
All alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'
But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh

[Verse 1]
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Verse 2]
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You and me, we just don't get along

Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever

The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes

Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase

Stressed Outtwenty one pilots,"[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

You’re so indecisive, what I’m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know…

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Verse 2]
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Tryna compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know…

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? (I wanna know)
Oh, what do you mean? (Ooh)
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean? (Oh baby)
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Outro]
Oh, oh (Don't be so selfish baby, yeah)
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey yeah (You're so confusing baby)
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? (Be more straight forward)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?"

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five

And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

Love YourselfJustin Bieber,"[Produced by Benny Blanco]

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"

[Verse 1]
Never thought this would happen
Gotta let it sink in, you're gone
Don't know, know what I'm feeling
I must be dreaming, you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You thought there were no boundaries
But you just pushed me too far
I guess nobody taught you
Nobody taught you how to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

[Bridge]
You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Oh, now look at what you lost
You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Now look at what you lost, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I used to love you

IrresistibleFall Out Boy,"[Verse 1]
Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA

[Chorus]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name

[Chorus]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey, I don't know
What you're doing to me,  mon chéri
But the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war

[Chorus]
And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby"

Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles
Just what you’d expect inside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockefellers

[Pre-Chorus]
Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father
But he could never love somebody’s daughter
Football team loved more than just the game
So he vowed to be his husband at the altar

Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all

Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax

I don't wanna be the last man standing
I don't wanna be the lonely one
Picking petals when the party's over
No, it's not any fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I'm fragile
And you know this

So hold me
Wrap me in love, fill up my cup
Empty and only your love can fill up my cup
Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh
Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh

I don't wanna be the first one folding
I don't wanna be the joker heart
Tell me, darling, will you understand me?
And not show me your cards?

Pour out your perfection on me now

When We Were YoungAdele,"[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"

I met her in the hotel lobby
Then we started loving in the elevator (in the elevator)
You know I had to eat that
Tongue on her body, see you later, alligator (woo)
Rolling 'round in the bed, smacking her on her ass
She a stone-cold killer, .45 in the bag
Mama told her never mess with a nigga like me (like me)
I took her to Fruit Town to meet my OG
I took her to the west side, like, ""What's up?""
We was on the east side, we fucked
Now we sitting court-side, P-dub
Put me in the bed, you ain't gotta worry 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
So you better stay up, player (yeah, you better stay)
Yeah, you better keep up, player (up, player)
'Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player, up

[Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
But it ain't enough
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
'Cause it ain't enough

[Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
You and I make so much love (I don't wanna give up, nah)
Player (But you're making it rough, nah)
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back (You got me holding back, holding back)
You and I make so much love (I been wanna give up, nah)
Player (But you're making it rough, nah)
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
'Cause it ain't enough

Can't Sleep LovePentatonix,"[Intro]
Uh huh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Scott (Mitch)]
Tell me, am I going crazy?
Tell me, have I lost my mind?
Am I just afraid of loving?
Or am I not the loving kind?

[Pre-Chorus: Scott, Kirstie & Mitch]
Kissing in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Getting old
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul, yeah
Cause I can't do it anymore

[Chorus: Kirstie, Scott & Mitch]
Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love

[Verse 2: Scott (Mitch)]
Maybe I'm too picky honey
But I'm not in the world you're in
I'm not in it for the money
I'm here looking for the real thing

[Pre-Chorus 2: Scott, Kirstie & Mitch]
Kissin' in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Gettin' old (It's gettin' old!)
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold (So, so, so cold!)
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul (to my soul, to my soul, to my soul)
Cause' I can't do it anymore, no

[Chorus: Kirstie, Scott & Mitch]
Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love

[Bridge: Scott]
I'm tired of dreaming of no one (I'm tired)
I need some body next to mine (I-I'm tired, yeah!)
Cause I'm dyin' to give it to someone (give it to someone)
Because I can't do it anymore

[Chorus: Kirstie, Scott & Mitch]
Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love"
Make UpR. City,"[Verse 1: R. City]
I give you everything you want
But all you talk about is everything I don't
Why you always talking slick?
It's like I can't do nothing without getting lip
Until I throw you on the bed
Put it down, pull your hair, kiss your neck
You love messing with my head
Sometimes I think that you not even upset

[Pre-Chorus 1: R. City]
One day, me no even talking to you
Next day, watch me call ya
One minute, you hate me
Then the next you want me put it on ya

[Chorus: Chloe Angelides]
I love it when we fight just to make up
Funny how bad words turn to making love
I get under your skin, babe, just because
I love it when we fight just to make up

[Verse 2: R. City]
Well, make it up to me, baby
I make you happy in the bed
But girl, it's so much better any time I get you mad
Why you so wicked and bad?
Attitude makes me want to bend you over my legs
Scream and yelling de house down
Sometimes you love me, sometimes you're coming for my head
We awake the whole town
Fighting like teenagers all over again

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. City]
We yelling, screaming
Then I threaten that I'm gonna leave ya
Then we get back, do it again
And baby, here's the reason

[Chorus: Chloe Angelides]
I love it when we fight just to make up
Funny how bad words turn to making love
I get under your skin, babe, just because
I love it when we fight just to make up

[Bridge: Chloe Angelides & R. City]
Well, make it up to me, baby
I'll make it up to you, baby
I'll make it up to you, baby
I'll make it up to you, make it up to you
I'll make it up to you, baby
Well, make it up to me, baby
Well, make it up to me, baby
Well, make it up to me, up to me

[Chorus: Chloe Angelides]
I love it when we fight just to make up
Funny how bad words turn to making love
I get under your skin, babe, just because
I love it when we fight just to make up
I love it when we fight just to make up
And it's funny how bad words turn to making love
I get under your skin, babe, just because
I love it when we fight just to make up"
Hands To MyselfSelena Gomez,"[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice

So come on give me a taste
Of what it’s like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

[Chorus]
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

[Verse 2]
The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

[Chorus]
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

[Bridge]
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?

[Chorus]
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself

I Took A Pill In IbizaMike Posner,"[Verse 1]
I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

[Chorus]
Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs (Hey)

[Bridge]
I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

[Chorus]
You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs"

7 YearsLukas Graham,"[Chorus 1]
Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus 2]
Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus 3]
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

(Lukas Graham!!!)

[Verse 3]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

[Chorus 4]
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

[Bridge]
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

[Chorus 5]
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

[Outro]
Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Once I was seven years old"
Never Forget YouZara Larsson,"[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
I used to be so happy, but without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left, but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me, but I feel there's somethin' you should know

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

[Verse 2: MNEK]
Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight

So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind? (Take you off my mind)

[Bridge: Zara Larsson & MNEK]
Feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had somethin' special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you

And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze

There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
Are we gonna sweep this under the carpet?

To make it all alright, all alright for us

New RomanticsTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker
You can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace (ahh)
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (yeah) to get knocked off our feet

Something In The Way You MoveEllie Goulding,"[Verse 1]
It's the strangest feeling
Feeling this way for you
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you move
With you I’m never healing
It’s heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
I don’t know what it is you do
Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here, yours again

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

There's an evil night air, the stars don't shine tonight, (night)
There's something in the way you do
There's something in the way you
Push me closer, further
Break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing  left for me to lose
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

Bow your head, they're pious here

To those who say we can't sit there

Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

[Pre-Chorus]
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

[Chorus]
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are"
Sound Of Your HeartShawn Hook,"[Verse 1]
You were my courage
My sword and shield
Grace under pressure
My wall of steel
I was a stone
Weighing us down
You were the angel I chained to the ground
I miss the way you undress
I miss your head on my chest

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stop this bleeding
Can't stop you leaving
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

Baby I'm in love with you
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

[Verse 2]
You showed me heaven
You rang a bell
I played with matches
It hurt like hell
Asleep, awake
You're all I see
I can't escape you, can't set you free
I miss your full moon rising
Catching a breath in silence

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stop this bleeding
Can't stop you leaving
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

Baby I'm in love with you

Baby I'm comin, baby I'm comin
Say the word baby I'll come running

Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Beating, beating
Oh, I'm missing the sound of your heart beating"
Make Me Like YouGwen Stefani,"[Verse 1]
I was fine 'fore I met you

Let It GoJames Bay,"[Verse 1]
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

[Breakdown]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

Come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Lost BoyRuth B,"[Verse 1]
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day...

[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

[Verse 2]
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook
Neverland, I love you so, you are now my home sweet home
Forever a Lost Boy at last
Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook
Neverland, I love you so, you are now my home sweet home
Forever a Lost Boy at last
And for always I will say...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and
And when we're bored we play in the Woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

Stole The ShowKygo,"[Verse 1: Parson James]

We're watching, watching as the credits all roll down
And crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house

[Pre-Chorus 1: Parson James]
No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end, for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on

We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh

While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone

Die A Happy ManNelly,"[Verse 1]
Oh baby girl, last night
Hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between that bottle of wine
And that look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Well then we danced in the dark under September stars
In the pouring rain

Brings me to my knees

In my wildest dreams

Drive a sports car up the coast to California

Maybe I can die a happy man

Is it alright if I come round

Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize (Size, size)

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

I think about all the time
Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes

Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday
And every night your Valentine…

"Sit Still, Look PrettyDaya","[Verse 1]
Could dress up, to get love
But guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world
Could wake up in make up and play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things like diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Mr. Right could be nice, for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo
That Snow White, she did right in her life
Had 7 men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for

The only thing a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity
And I might love me some vanilla, but I'm not that sugar sweet

Can't Stop The Feeling!Justin Timberlake,"[Verse 1]
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

[Refrain]
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)

Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Treat You BetterShawn Mendes,"[Verse 1]
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead

Better than he can

Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can"
ToothbrushDNCE,"[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a limbo, half hypnotized
Each time I let you stay the night, stay the night
Up in the morning, tangled in sheets
We play the moment on repeat, on repeat

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go, weird
Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Verse 2]
No need to question next time we meet
I know you’re coming home with me, home with me
Sweat like a sauna, break up the ice
I know you’re gonna stay the night, stay the night

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go, weird
Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't want this to end
And there's no need to play pretend
If you stay with me again
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go, weird
Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place"

We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore

Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

Wherever I GoOneRepublic,"[Chorus]
I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 1]
Some people lie but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same

[Chorus 2]
I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 2]
Some people try but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

[Chorus]
I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you, you

[Bridge]
Some people pray to their god for some magic
Cause no easy love could ever make them feel the same
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Outro]
You think it's a lie when I'm telling the truth
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Looking for you, looking for you, ah"

Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]
You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I, Oh-I, Oh-I

I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah

And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it

You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

I'm too good to you

What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over

Mama SaidLukas Graham,"[Chorus]
When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

[Verse 1]
Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never travelled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

[Chorus]
When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

[Verse 2]
Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don’t think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I'd be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids, they started bugging me
But now they're all standing right in front of me

[Chorus]
When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

[Bridge]
I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I’m in doubt and struggling
That’s where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That’s why I always keep them tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?

[Chorus]
My mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

When Mama said that it was okay

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"

Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound

I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh baby won't you cum again?
She said ""I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering""

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said ""I love you""
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you ""Just don't get it""
'Cause I know you do

And I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound

It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say (You say) I'm such a cliché
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

You're so conceited, I said ""I love you""

You & MeMarc E. Bassy,"[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more It’s just you and me

If we bump into each other

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down

I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Outro: Sam Harris]
More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'

For more pain

Then you're the one who's got a hold on me

Blank SpaceTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever

I'm Not The Only OneSam Smith,"[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life"
Love Me HarderAriana Grande,"[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (Lo-love me harder)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, The Weeknd]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

Thinking Out LoudEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
The Heart Wants What It WantsSelena Gomez,"[Intro]
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Outro]
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby"
The Hanging TreeJames Newton Howard,"[Verse 1]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where they strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 2]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where a dead man called out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 3]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we’d both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 4]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Wear a necklace of rope
Side by side with me
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 3]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we’d both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 1]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where they strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where a dead man called out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree"
Heroes (We Could Be)Alesso,"[Verse 1: Tove Lo]

We go undercover, wait out the Sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty, that’s where we run

Prayer In CLillywood,"[Verse 1]

You didn't send me no letter
Don't think I could forgive you
See, our world is slowly dying
I'm not wasting no more time
Don't think I could believe you

And our hair will be grey

And their houses were destroyed
Don't think they could forgive you

Hey, when seas will cover lands
And when man will be no more
Don't think you can forgive you
Yeah, when there'll just be silence
And when life will be over
Don't think you will forgive you"
GhostElla Henderson,"[Chorus]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake

I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
'Cause I love living innocent
Oh, you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learned

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

Give up the ghost, stop the haunting baby
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, no more haunting baby
I keep going to the river...

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake"

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries

Is all it will take
We'll go down in history

We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history

Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance

And I just wanna see that thing drop

Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck

Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

I LivedOneRepublic,"[Verse 1]
Hope when you take that jump
You don't fear the fall
Hope when the water rises
You built a wall
Hope when the crowd screams out
It's screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs
You choose to stay
Hope that you fall in love
And it hurts so bad
The only way you can know
Is give it all you have
And I hope that you don't suffer
But take the pain
Hope when the moment comes
You'll say

[Hook]
I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

[Verse 2]
Hope that you spend your days
But they all add up
And when that sun goes down
Hope you raise your cup
Oh, oh
I wish that I could witness
All your joy and all your pain
But until my moment comes
I'll say

I, I did it all

You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (mm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (mm, yeah)
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you,"" and I
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""

If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

But every minute that I'm with you
I feel the fever and I won't lie, I break a sweat
My body's telling all the secrets I ain't told you yet

Night ChangesOne Direction,"[Verse 1: Zayn  & Liam]
Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We’re only getting older, baby
And I’ve been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We’re only getting older, baby
And I’ve been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Bridge: Zayn]
Going out tonight, changes into something red, her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

[Chorus: Harry]
We’re only getting older, baby
And I’ve been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby, it will never change, baby
It will never change, me and you"

TuesdayI LOVE MAKONNEN,"[Intro]
Say dawg
I remember way back
I’m talkin’ way way way back
Petey had the grey black
Two tone wave cap
You say we rap niggas be like
Oh, so you supposed to be a rapper
Fuck outta here man

[Prehook]
Just gotta say it
Can’t hold it in
Woke up at 10
I’ve smokin’ since 10
You might say that its trife
Shit it is what it is
When you living your life
And the stress is a bitch
So I do what do

[Hook]
Don’t judge me
Don’t judge me
Cause mary jane is the
Only girl that love me
So fuck the hoes and
These cops tryna cuff me

[Verse 1]
Now first off to the holice
Let me say mutha fuck you
You 'pose to serve and protect
But we need to get protection from you
Every nigga ain't a criminal
Nah nah nah nah
Every time I drive by one
They follow follow
Like I said mutha fuck you
To these rappers putting me to the test
I would have crushed you like a bug
But didn’t have time to clean up the mess
Too many bones and body parts
That I would need to collect
But shit every living soul
Owes the reaper a debt
And let me switch topics again
Cause I’m deep in regret
I was cursed labeled a dog and
Forced to sleep on the steps
Them fly wifey types
We never seem to respect
You stay screamin' I never cared
But I grieved when you left

[Prehook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now next thing is these chatty patties
Gossiping mutha fuck you
Heard they claim they real niggas
But that ain't how real niggas move
Are they beefing are they talking
Who’s these girls and who’d he fuck
Nosey asses know my coke head
Be like van goh with the brush
I can get it all and have it all
It still won’t be enough bitch
Petey Petey moving on the fast track
Petey thinkin' abstract
Petey get the first
And get the last laugh
Petey blowing smoke out
On the snapchat pack stat
Petey p just wanna know
Who’s crib We meeting back at
It's my time nigga my moment
Imma own it
I turn up every Tuesday
I love Makonnen
I’m dusty, smoking
Girl bust it open
My luggage ? ?
Forgot my lotion
Still coasting
In Costa Rica
In coach seating
When they see it's us roaming
We like some roman caesars
Prestigious Petey Petey
Bison Beckford
Coulda modeled if I was taller
But i like my leverage
I gave you demons and
Paint on my Vices effort
And now all I hear is jeers
Like Obie Trice's record
I’ll still cop it if
They overprice the necklace
These rappers ain’t nice and
Y’all overhyping their efforts

We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip

Tell her friend to join in both ways

I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming ""Who want what?""
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the limelight
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, ""Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front""
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
The young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus

[Bridge]
One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold and now everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby


[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no
And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no"
Heartbeat SongKelly Clarkson,"[Intro]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long

[Verse 1]
You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a lifetime

[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long (All night long)

[Verse 2]
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would've had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a lifetime

[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long

[Bridge]
Until tonight, I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I've ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (One more time)

[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long"

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European, swervin', ayy
Look, describe Iggy groundbreaking what the word is
Hit the stage, ass shakin' like I'm nervous
When in New York, I be parkin' right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killing 'em on purpose
I-G-G-Y did she just have to do it?
Baby ride with me, fly living, there ain't nothing to it
And my waist slim, ass fat, you gotta have it
Yeah, my bake on, cake long, that's automatic

[Chorus: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
P-P-P-Pussy power, pay me by the hour
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers
If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours
All yellow gold on me, like I'm Trinidad (James)
Sittin' drop top, wondering where the ceiling's at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feeling that now
Iggy Iggy Iggy, can't you see?
That everybody wanna put they hands on me
See I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me, wait

[Chorus: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Talking all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah
(Oh ayy oh) nuh-uh (Oh ayy oh) nuh-uh (Oh ayy oh)
Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Make me wanna laugh like har-de-har-de-har
(Oh ayy oh) nuh-uh (Oh ayy oh) nuh-uh

I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

[Outro: MØ (and Iggy Azalea)]
Got you hooked boy, I'm like a drug
If you want my love better smoke it up

You can look, boy, but don't you touch
If you want my love make me give a fuck
(Make you beg for it, I'ma make you beg for it)"

With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she’s nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch, but she’s warm as a devil
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
She takes 'til I break and I can’t get more

Wasted again, but I can’t say no, whoa

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'

Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

Yeah, 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days ‘til Friday
I’m tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'

Thinkin', ""How could I be so selfish?""
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been

Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', ""How could I be so reckless?""
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (mhm)
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

They have stolen from us

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor

We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it

You’ve never danced like this before

Shouldn’t talk about it

Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

[Chorus]
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it"
One Last TimeAriana Grande,"[Verse 1]
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful

I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (woo)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it

And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this

Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie

Lay Me DownSam Smith,"[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Living For LoveMadonna,"[Verse 1]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard
I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was
I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees
Alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you

Not falling apart
Once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Not a trace of gasoline

Now I’m caught in a war with no shield

I see nobody left here to blame
‘Cause I made myself a prisoner
Shackled up by all my fears
But I feel you breaking away at the walls
Make them fall make them all disappear

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Bad BloodTaylor Swift,"[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Think about the good times

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last

All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

Her body's like the summer

Because I just can't stand it

Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty

What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

[Chorus]
The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young
(How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young
(And watch the world pass us by)
The night is still young
(How dare we sit quietly)
So are we

[Verse 2]
Ayo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me
We ain't going nowhere like tanks is on E
We still getting money, what bank it's gon' be?
If he sexy, he planking on me
So when them big boys want all of that (Ay!)
Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ay!)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ay!)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

[Chorus]
The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young
(How dare we sit quietly)

The night is still young
(How dare we sit quietly)
So are we

[Outro]
How dare we sit quietly
And watch the world pass us by
How dare we sit quietly
And watch the world pass us by"

Elastic HeartSia,"[Verse 1]
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus]
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

[Post-Chorus]
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

[Verse 2]
And I will stay up through the night
Yeah, let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doin' everythin' I can
And another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp

All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise (It's Iggy-Iggs!)
We're just so pretty!

Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want (Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Set your watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: (Britney Spears) & Iggy Azalea]

(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go) It's just so funny

Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, ""Hey, baby!""
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (Ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs
What's up, Britney?

CheerleaderOMI,"Kid Ink, egh
I think I found a genie in a bottle baby, with a bottle shape
And she don't have no problem representing for the team

Ok it's feeling like I just hit the lotto, baby
32-26-34, wasted
Watch her do a dance then it get me in the game
Going hard in the paint what's my name what's my name girl
You know, I be missing that bom-bom when I'm away
I swear, when you shaking them pom-poms all I can say is

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
Cause she' stay strong (yeah yeah)
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Ahh, I need her, right here where she need to be
Complimenting my style you're flyer with the Captain of the team
Now move, right, right there, hit reverse girl and back that rear
Roll it with me and then light that up and the rest is history write that, book
My cheerleader, something about her demeanor
Even though I'm off these margaritas can't none of these hoes here come between us
Shorty no regular chick, so I just take her to places she ain't know exist
So she never forget, who the man is

She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

I need,right right there
I need,right right there
I need,right right there
Right right there"
GeronimoSheppard,"[Verse 1]
Can you feel it? Now it's coming back

When I lost it, yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it, didn't understand
You were waiting as I dove into the waterfall

Well I'm just a boy with a broken toy
All lost and coy, at the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand, as a broken man
But I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall

Now I'm falling down, through the crashing sound
And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me and it sets us free
So I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall

So Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo!

I Really Like YouCarly Rae Jepsen,"[Verse 1]

I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

You and me, and this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

Pray To GodCalvin Harris,"[Verse 1]
Oh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore

I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love is what made you strong
I pray to god, I just don't know anymore

When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down anything in life, I know now
I've been lyin' on the floor
Sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything in life, I know how

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you, give in  to you

[Verse 3]
Oh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
The visions in my mind are enough to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down
The other way around
I don't want the words to, I can't make a sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

I'd give in

PhotographEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus 1]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus 2]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"

[Intro]
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch it

[Verse 1]
Lost in the cracks of the landslide
You saw me slipping on my blind side
I'm feeling lost, feeling tongue-tied
And now I'm frozen in your headlights

[Verse 2]
Deep in the haze of your love high
I used to soar on the live wire
I'm coming down from your supply
And I don't know if you can make right

[Chorus]
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Interlude]
Watch it, watch it

[Verse 3]
Shot through the cracks of the earthquake
My body's moving into retrograde
I'm feeling loose, feeling untamed
And you're the dynamite in my chains

[Verse 4]
Deep in the trench of the crossfire
You shot me down from the live wire
Tossed to the loss in your love game
You beat me cheating and now I can't play

[Chorus]
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Bridge]
Hit the ground running up from you
Baby, you know I don't want to, no, I want you
But there's nothing left to say
Lost in the riddle you gave me
Caught in the middle, you played me
I see so plainly, but there's nothing left to say
I should have known, I should have known
Known, no, no-no-no-no...

[Chorus]
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

Lean OnMajor Lazer,"[Produced by Major Lazer and DJ Snake]

[Verse 1]
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

[Verse 2]
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on

Don't Look DownMartin Garrix,"[Verse 1]
Is your head spinning?
Is your heart racing?
Is that fire in your veins?
Are your bones burning?
Is your skin yearning?
Cause you're driving me insane

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I kinda feel like I, feel like I saw the light
You got me way up, a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Like we're flying in outer space?

[Chorus]
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now
Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

[Verse 2]
Are your hands shaking?
Are your fists breaking?
Are you climbing over walls?
Are the times changing?
Is the noise fading?
Cause I wanna get it out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I kinda feel like I, feel like I saw the light
You got me way up, a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Or are you afraid to fall?

Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now

Ghost TownAdam Lambert,"[Verse 1]
Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer

[Chorus]
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

[Verse 2]
Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire

[Chorus]
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

[Bridge]
There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a fuck if I go
Down, down, down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing
Oh, my heart is a ghost town

[Outro]
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
Oh, my heart is a ghost town
(Said, my heart)
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town"

Fight SongRachel Platten,"[Verse 1]
Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

[Pre-Chorus]
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

[Chorus]
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now, I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care
If nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got
A lot of fight left in me

[Verse 2]
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep, say I'm in too deep (In too deep)
And it's been two years, I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe

Take Your TimeSam Hunt,"[Verse 1]
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me

I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time"
Should've Been UsTori Kelly,"[Verse 1]
Walk around with my head down
But I can't hide with these high heels on
Downtown in the thick crowd
But it’s just you that my mind is on
Dressed up, got my heart messed up

Tonight Belongs To U!Jeremih,"[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Wasn't looking for it to heal the scar
But today I was riding on Lonely Boulevard
Wishing all wasn't lost and then there, there you came
Honestly a star shooting through the scene
In the sky, that's where we are, and I'm tryna catch a beam
See them other girls, yeah they try, but they ain't fly like you

Got it heated from the steaming, full speed right with you

And I can't deny it, girl your body's so damn beautiful
Let me see you turn around like ay, baby go on drop it to the ground like ay
Red lips, yellow bone green like ay, eyes popping baby 'til I beat the thing right
Oh now, feeling like y'all finally found out, what what what what, slow down
Pull the trigger too fast and I'll bust my gun gun gun gun, no conversation
Don't stop with all the shaking, them other girls really basic
You amazing, so glad I got you girl

Like I CanSam Smith,"[Verse 1]
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be a preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

[Verse 3]
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem
But then again, he’ll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

[Bridge]
We both have demons that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're self-seeking, an honest man
Then stop deceiving, Lord please

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can"

Tied up like a shoe lace
I don't like it, I don't like it"
Beautiful LifeNick Fradiani,"[Verse 1]
These days
Well, they're looking up
We got so much to say
We got someone to love
We got good friends
They're so good to us
And haters can hate
And fakers can front

[Pre-Chorus]
So we try to live
Like it's all we've got
Cause for all we know

This could be the last night of our lives
Gonna chase down our every desire
We blaze the night
With all we've been waiting for
All this time
Reaches such great heights
Gives us just one perfect night
To say ""oh, what a beautiful life""
""Oh, what a beautiful life""

We got nothing to fear
We got nothing but heart
Can't just wait here to see what it brings
We got too many hopes
We got too many dreams

DowntownMacklemore,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I went to the moped store, said ""Fuck it""
And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe (Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace (Downtown)
Of a leather seat between your legs
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown

[Verse 4: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Dope
Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow
You can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
Of a leather seat between your legs

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're

Oh, my, my, my, what you do to me?

Every time that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above

Didn't I rock with you all night?

Brought out the animal in me
Nobody else can tame that beast
Why did you have to go and say goodbye?

Kitty on fleek, it’s popping, I’m Mary Poppins
Just for the record, that heart is what I’m copping
Blasting 2Pac in some fishnet stockings
You know you miss this ride
M-I-S-S, missed the spot
Used to call me Hillary cause I ride ‘em (Rodham)
I said, “ring, ring, ring, ring, ra-ring, ring
Put a ring on it or ding, da-ding, ding”
Boy your times up, where’d you wind up?
There’s levels to this (uhh!), you shoulda climbed up
(Let's go)

You used your love to tear me apart
Now fuck me back together  (now put me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart (right into my heart)

Hold Each OtherA Great Big World,"[Verse 1: Ian Axel]
I miss the words we used to say
I miss the sounds of yesterday
I miss the games we used to play like ohhh
I was trapped inside a dream
I couldn't see her next to me
I didn't know she'd set me free like ohhh

[Hook: Ian Axel]
Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short and the nights get a little bit colder
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other, mmm

[Verse 2: Chad King]
Everything looks different now
All this time my head was down
He came along and showed me how to let go
I can't remember where I'm from
All I know is who I've become
That our love has just begun like ohhh

[Hook: Chad King]
Something happens when I hold him
He keeps my heart from getting broken
When the days get short and the nights get a little bit frozen
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other, mmm

[Verse 3: Futuristic]
Yo, if I'm stressing you that blessing that's sent from heaven
These days start to feel like hours and hours feel more like seconds
People judged us they couldn't see the connection
When I look at you, it's like I'm looking back at my reflection
I don't see nothing different, our pigments they coincide
We hold each other so tight they couldn't break us if they tried
My eyes are are those of the blind, I see no color or size
I feel the love in your touch and I trust what's inside your mind, okay
I know that we've been through a lot
I know that we both grew up
You know I missed you a lot
When I was young I was dumb
Didn't think you'd fit in my plot
And I appreciate the break because I love what we got now
You give me chills and I can't imagine you leaving
If I could build a perfect person honestly you would be it
And you know nobody knows you like I know you
I can't wait to come back home so I can hold you, yeah

[Hook: A Great Big World]
Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short and the nights get a little bit colder

We hold each other

Saying she might be pregnant

Got you out trying to get a table and a picture

Round and round and round we go
Waiting for the wind to blow
As we walk this world alone
Only love can bring us home
Waving powerless and blind
But tomorrow, we'll be kind
Let love guide us through the rain
Forget our yesterday

Only love can conquer all and move mountains
When you cold, only love makes you warm again
Only love heals a broken heart, we been through
It all girl, came through the storm again
Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free
I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me
Forever in my eyes, you will always be the one for me
I'll always love you until they read out my eulogy

Love heals all, love kills war
I love the hustle but I love you more
Ride or die that's what love is for
Believe it or not, God loves us all
When I was down and out
You were down with me
Things got deep, you'd drown with me
If there was heat, I know you'd cock back
Click, clap, spit a round with me
Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me
To all them haters, they can come get and me
It's us against the world, 150 I love Miami
That's my city, 305

The MonsterEminem,"[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Swing my heart across the line

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like Lebron, now Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, why, ‘cause it's about to go down

[Bridge: Pitbull & (Ke$ha)]
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round

One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down

It's goin' down, I'm yellin' timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
It's goin' down (It's goin' down), I'm yellin' timber
You better move, you better dance (You better dance)

DemonsImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"
Wake Me Up!Avicii,"[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Outro]
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know

Sweater WeatherThe Neighbourhood,"[Verse 1]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life

All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn

I guess I should've let you win

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low

Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain

She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)

I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open

I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

White WallsMacklemore,"[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
Q

[Chorus: Hollis]
Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright"

Let go and just be free

Walk through the storm, I would

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet, cause

[Chorus 1]
I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, ""I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead""
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end

[Chorus 2]
Say, yeah, (yeah!) let's be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
Scream it from the top of your lungs (yeah!)
Say, yeah, (yeah!) let's be alone together (yeah!)
We can stay young forever (yeah!)
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

BraveSara Bareilles,"[Produced by Mark Endert]

[Verse 1]
You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

[Verse 2]
Everybody’s been there
Everybody’s been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

[Bridge]
And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
See you be brave

[Outro]
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you"

Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

How I FeelFlo Rida,"[Hook]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

Yeah, I'm a new man, baby
Your other men probably should follow my blueprint, baby
Strap on your seat, and get ready to go
You know I've been filling BeatPort
3 million feed up in the sky full diamonds
I'm only beginning and I get the feeling
I'm behind the beat for the nighters
I got a few Miami Viaces
I don't ever look at the prices
My super bowl tickets are priceless
You know who the king of the night is
Beautiful music for you to go lower
And when girl go work, this for life
I think I'm bipolar

[Hook]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

What a feeling I get when I throw up my pistols
From party, and bigger than life
50 bottles of Luminis
24 kick, pop my dollars, wake up for the night
Cameras flicking, I see me
You're fixing, I'm fixing my color
My natural height
She can get it, my whole click with it
No question, we are on the champion flight
This is how I ride, my passenger fly
We take off in London and land in the Dubai
This is a marriage, the music my ride
My life is so lavish, you don't recognize
So let's toast to a new day in Rochan
80 million they still rollercoasting
What's the recipe to this devotion?
I got the melody, sober like couches

Oh-eh-oh
Who told y'all the party's over?
Oh-eh-oh
Well, it ain't over till I told y'all
I feel my cup runnin' over
Tomorrow I  might be sober
But oh, tonight, I'm like

I fly High!
It's a new day
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
It's a new day
And you know how I feel"
Thinking About YouCalvin Harris,"[Verse 1]
If I told you, that this couldn't get better baby
And your heart beat, it let's me know you feel the same
I can hold you, keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worry cause I can give you what you need

[Bridge]
Now everything I do
Is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you everyday
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'd do anything you want me to
Like any other day I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you say

[Hook]
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you

[Verse 2]
In a moment, I know that everything can change
And I know that my life will never be the same
You're the only one that's making sense to me
When I close my eyes you're the one I see
There's no other way I can ever be without you babe

[Bridge]
Now everything I do
Is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you everyday
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose

On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys

Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name

Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

Old School LoveLupe Fiasco,"[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Give me that old school love right now
You know when I hold you, you won’t be alone
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup...

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Give me your old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone...

Does it feel good?

[Verse 2]
If I partied 'til the morning would you stay with me?
Girl would you play with me
Or would you hate on me?
If I ran all out of money
Would you pay for me
Or would you stray from me?
I need to know it babe
If there's something I could do to make you see the light
Girl that I'll treat you right
I'd do it every night
Every second that I'm with you it's a special world
Like I'm your only man
And you're my only girl

[Hook]
I give you all my lovin to you
I give you all my lovin to you

Can't Remember To Forget YouShakira,"[Verse 1: Shakira]
I left a note on my bedpost
Said, ""Not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes""
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah, you gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You a part of me now
You a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

[Chorus: Shakira]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Shakira, Both]
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow

Keep Me CrazyChris Wallace,"Oh, ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhh
You were an angel on the run
That I caught some how
I tried so hard to figure you out
But baby you're a pretty little mystery
That makes no sense to me

You got me stayin' up all night, burnin' inside
The voices in my head won't quit
I may be losin' my mind and goin' insane
But I put up with your... ha ha

And it's a wild ride
Every single night
Even the worst of times
Are the best of times
Got me singin'

Sunday dinner with a bottle of jack
Drive around town, like a heart attack
Baby you're a mess, but it's meant to be
'Cause you keep me crazy

Tell me you love me and everything's alright
57 seconds and you start a fight
Baby some how you're the one I need
'Cause you keep me crazy

Oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Another little fight
You say you're done
We'll see about that when the mornin comes
'Cause first you're out then you're right back in
Here we go again

And it's a wild ride
Every single night
Even the worst of times
Are the best of times
You got me singin'

Sunday dinner with a bottle of jack
Drive around town, like a heart attack
Baby you're a mess, but it's meant to be
'Cause you keep me crazy

Tell me you love me and everything's alright
57 seconds for you to start a fight
Baby some how you're the one I need
'Cause you keep me crazy

Oh you keep me crazy
So much that I want more
You're just the lunatic I've been lookin' for
Oh you keep me crazy

A star in the 40s, center fold in the 50s
You got me tripping out like the 60s, hippies

Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and an 80s best
Hepburn, Beyonce, Marilyn, massive
Girl you're timeless, just so classic

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time

Drunk In LoveBeyonce,"[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, ""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, ""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé + JAY-Z]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now… Hold up!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

All Of MeJohn Legend,"[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me

You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me

Ain't It FunParamore,"[Verse 1]
I don't mind
Letting you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you

Well you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble

When the world don't orbit around you
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you

Not A Bad ThingJustin Timberlake,"[Verse 1]
Said all I want from you
Is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you’ll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it throw in every other day to start

[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me (Staring back at me)

With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms

Blacked out
Everything faded on your love
I’m already wasted so close
That I can taste it now, now
So let’s break right out of these gilded cages
We’re going to make it now
Don’t ever turn around
Don’t ever turn around

Nobody else needs to know

White lights, flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs, something we can’t ignore
We can’t back down
We’ll never let them change us

What are we waiting for...
What are we waiting for...

SingEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

[Chorus]
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

[Chorus]
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

[Bridge]
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Final Chorus]
SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!

Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

[Verse 1: Luke]
Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey

[Chorus: All]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

[Verse 2: Calum]
Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

[Chorus: All]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart

Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there

#SELFIEThe Chainsmokers,"[Verse 1]
When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because, he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing ""Summertime Sadness""?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette?
I really need one
But first
Let me take a selfie

[Beat Break]
Let me take a selfie

[Verse 2]
Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be?
I want it to be clever
How about ""Living with my bitches, #LIV""
I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

[Beat Break]
Selfie, selfie, let me take a selfie

[Verse 3]
Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie
What a creep
Is that guy sleeping over there?
Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays?
Ok, let's go take some shots
Oh no, I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait, never mind, I'm fine
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here?
Oh my god, Jason just texted me
Should I go home with him?
I guess I took a good selfie

Sleeping With A FriendNeon Trees,"[Verse 1]
All my friends, they’re different people
Anxious like the ocean in a storm
When we go out, yeah, we’re electric
Coursing through our bodies ’til we’re one

And why mess up a good thing, baby?
It’s a risk to even fall in love
So, when you give that look to me
I better look back carefully
‘Cause this is trouble, yeah this is trouble

[Hook]
I said ooh, ooh
You got me in the mood, mood
I’m scared, but if my heart’s gonna break
Before the night will end
I said, ooh, ooh we’re in danger
Sleeping with a friend, sleeping with a friend
Sleeping with a friend

[Verse 2]
All my friends, stay up past midnight
Looking for the thing to fill the void
I don’t go out much like I used to
Something ’bout the strangers and the noise

And why leave when I got you, baby?
It’s a risk but babe, I need the thrill
I never said you’d be easy
But if it was all up to me
I’d be no trouble, hey, we’re in trouble

HeadlightsEminem,"[Produced by Emile Haynie & Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life"

Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hidin'?

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!""
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical

Don't Say GoodnightHot Chelle Rae,"[Intro]
Come on, don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnight

[Verse 1]
Check cashed and I'm ready for the weekend
Blow it all, making memories with my friends
Two girls on my lap, super packed in
(It's alright, it's alright)
Plug the iPod in, put on A$AP
Hella loud, tryna rap
""You can't rap!""
In her work uniform, but she's still bad
(It's alright, it's alright)

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a deep breath and don't be shy
Don't you worry about tomorrow 'cause tomorrow ain't tonight just kick back, let the universe align

[Chorus]
Come on, don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnight

[Verse 2]
Super drunk, still saying that we're just buzzed
Last call, everybody's getting paired up
Making out at the bar, call it young love
(It's alright, it's alright)
Let's find a bonfire, or we can start one
Throw your middle fingers up to a new sun
'Cause we ain't sober and the party's never over, singing
It's alright, it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a deep breath and don't be shy
Don't you worry about tomorrow 'cause tomorrow ain't tonight just kick back, let the universe align

Come on, don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnight

[Bridge]
I feel like we could do almost anything
Got my ride
And a sweet little Mary Jane in those skinny jeans
By my side
She gets me high
And I didn't expect this night to go so well

[Chorus]
Come on, don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnigh
Come on, don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnight"

You & IOne Direction,"[Verse 1: Niall & Liam]
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

[Chorus: Harry]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

[Verse 2: Zayn, Niall and Liam & Louis, Niall and Liam]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us

You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I

We don't wanna be like them

I stood at this door before, I'm told
But a part of me knows that I'm growing too old
Confused what I thought with something I felt
Confuse what I feel with something that's real
I tried to sell my soul last night
Funny, he wouldn't even take a bite

Making smart with their words again, well, I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it

And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark

Are you ready for tonight, setting it on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall
Maybe I should've known

That you would walk, you would walk out the door (hey)

Cut to the part, she broke your heart, and then she ran away
I guess you should've known
I guess you should've known that I would talk, I would talk

And then I'll lay it in instead
I like us better when we're wasted

If you go, well, now I know
I know, know, know

[Chorus]
Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

[Bridge]
Go, go, go, go, get out, get out of my memory
No, no, no, not tonight, I don't have the energy
Go, go, go, go, get out, get out of my memory
No, no, no, not tonight, oh, not tonight, oh, not tonight

[Chorus]
Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

Forever we tried to make it right
But together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

[Outro]
Forever we tried, forever we tried, yeah
Forever we tried, forever we tried, yeah
Forever we tried, forever we, forever we tried, yeah
Forever we tried, forever we tried, yeah"

[Verso 1: Enrique Iglesias, Randy Marcos]
Yo te miro y se me corta la respiración
Cuando tú me miras se me sube el corazón
(Me palpita lento el corazón)
Y en un silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

[Coro 1: Alexander, Rany Marcos]
Bailando (Bailando)

Tú cuerpo y el mío
Llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (Subiendo y bajando)
Bailando (Bailando)

Ese fuego por dentro
Me va enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

[Coro 1: Enrique Iglesias, Alexander]
Con tu física y tu química
También tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila
Y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo más)
Ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo más)

Con esta melodía
Tu color, tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía
Mi cabeza está vacía
Y ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo mas)

I Will Never Let You DownRita Ora,"[Verse 1]
Tell me, baby, what we gonna do?
I'll make it easy, got a lot to lose
Watch the sunlight coming through
Open the window, let it shine on you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine (Hey!)
You've been tired of watching me
Forgot to have a good time, boy (Hey!)
You can't take it, all these faces
Never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel

[Chorus]
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down

[Verse 2]
There's a million ways to go
Don't be embarrassed if you lose control
On the rooftop, now they know
Your body's frozen and you've lost your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine (Hey!)
You've been tired of watching me
Forgot to have a good time, boy (Hey!)

Never keeping it real (Yeah, yeah)
I know exactly how you feel

Let me take you where you never go
Have a little fun, it's the only way we know
Let me show you what you never see
You know how to love, only when you're holding me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you say you've had enough

If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

Black WidowIggy Azalea,"[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby
(Black, black widow, baby)

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

You used to be thirsty for me (Right)

Pulling my head into the clouds
I'm floating off

Uh, pull your panties down from under you

Drunk than a bitch, high on that Mary Jane
Pussy in my mouth, pussy on my pinky ring
Nasty, baby me do it in the backseat
Swear this marijuana keep it cracking
Lights, camera, action, I ain't doing nothing 'til the cash in
Money, money, money, weed, fashion
Draped up and dripped out, keep the trees passing
Girl toot that thing up, fuck me, fuck rapping
Days of our lives so clap, clap that cake
Spreading your thighs I pump, pump your brakes, ay

[Bridge: Tinashe]
Just give me the trees and we can smoke it ya
Just give me the drink and we can pour it ya
And my enemies, they see me living now
And if you roll with me, then you'll be winning now, oh

Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, bruh

Get ratchet, go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit, let's roll
I love to get 2 on
Let-let... let's roll
I love to get 2 on, I love to
Let-let-let's roll

Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous if anything, I'm restless

Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep

Amnesia5 Seconds Of Summer,"[Verse 1: Calum]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy and it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge: Luke]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[Chorus: All]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe"

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like

He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal

Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where's the fun in doing what you're told?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said ""No!""
""Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night, I'll make you""
""I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior""

But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen

Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

I said ""Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with thirty-year-olds and you think you've made it
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?""

I hope you still remember what I look like
I haven't seen you in a minute
Last night I had the kind of dream that you just don't wanna wake up from and that 's cus' you were in it
So this morning when I woke up it felt more like a nightmare cus' I rolled over and I thought that you'd be right there
But, nope i'm just laying here alone on my own wishing I was on the first flight home

I'll be home in no time
I promise when I touch down it'll be like I never left
Singing, I'll be home in no time
By the way check your phone cause I just sent you a text saying
Hey, I've been gone forever, I'm coming home tonight
We'll be back together, this plane gon' fly
I can't predict the weather, but you should know that I
I'll be on the first flight home, I'll be on the first flight home

And I bet if I left right now, I'd prolly' make it to you by the morning
So i'm packing up my bags hopping on this red eye
I'll be there before your eyes even open
Hurry up and tell the pilot to take off
So we could pick up right where we left off
I can't believe it, i'm finally on my way
Feels so damn good to be able to say

I'll be home in no time
I promise when I touch down it'll be like I never left
Singing, I'll be home in no time

Keep your head up to the sky
Cause I'll be on the first flight home, I'll be on the first flight home
Yeah and now I pull up to your driveway
Been a while since I've been on this block
And now I walk up to your front door
I know you recognize that same knock
I hear you running down the stairs now
Tears running down your face
Then you open up that front door and I look at you and say

Hey, I know I've been gone forever but i'm finally home tonight
Now that i'm here, I'm never leaving your side
I told you I was coming, sorry it took so long
I was on that first flight home, I was on the first flight home

Hey, I've been gone forever (yeah), I'm coming home tonight
We'll be back together, this plane gon' fly

Say hello to palm trees and Benzes

SecretsMary Lambert,"[Intro]
Okay
Game face
There we go

[Verse 1]
I've got bipolar disorder
My shit's not in order
I'm overweight, I'm always late
I've got too many things to say
I rock mom jeans, cat earrings
Extrapolate my feelings
My family is dysfunctional
But we have a good time killing each other

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
Inside ourselves
I know I'm not the only one
Who spent so long attempting to be someone else
Well, I'm over it

[Chorus]
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are

[Post-Chorus]
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?

[Verse 2]
I can't think straight, I'm so gay
Sometimes I cry a whole day
I care a lot, use an analog clock
And never know when to stop
And I'm passive aggressive
I'm scared of the dark and the dentist
I love my butt and won't shut up
And I never really grew up

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
Inside ourselves
I know I'm not the only one
Who spent so long attempting to be someone else
Well, I'm over it

[Chorus]
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you

Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

iKendrick Lamar,"Kendrick Lamar:
What inspired me as a kid really was, uh, illustrating my thoughts on that sheet of paper

Life's to me like a box of chocolates
(?) something for something, that's the obvious
Flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Biting my style, you (?)
Come from the same blocks where they pick cotton
Oh, you forgotten, ah, forget it
That life ain't sane

You see gangbanging, drug paraphernalia. You see things from the streets. So what you gon' do? You gon' find something that you love to do and have a passion for it, or you gon' stay, you  know, mingling in the streets until something major happens

So the moment I defined myself and freed myself was the time I locked myself in the studio and said, ""You need to do music.""

Tonight's for everybody, understand me
The plan B is the one in your hearts
This here is family, Kendrick Lamar
Words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
That's family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came into Compton to accomplish one thing: reign supreme
Raise a king named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for ""King"" and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochee to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well, I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
But it's muscle in my heart
I stare in the eyes of Mozart and tell him I'm the genius
I love myself, really love myself
And I means this with all sole
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating
With the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
I tell 'em, ""Get out my wallet and passion in your logic""
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn, that boy good
I'm bright as Thomas Edison but I'm Gucci Mane in the hood
I stood alone for so long, prolonged my whole career
But now I'm here, you can shoot shots and cheer
Because I am, we are Kendrick Lamar

Getting into that success level where you can go back to your neighborhood and people feel like, you know, uh, they look up to you. Sometimes the most riskiest things you can do can end up being, you know, the most important. Yeah

Hey baby, baby, I got it so, so bad

[Verse]
Pan down from the pine trees, high, where you'll find me
High, with the Visine, hot, since the 90s
Misfit weirdo, [?] on the bureau, see these piles of tapes?
And I'm back for the past with a pack full of tracks, Outkast [?]
I'm still kissing the sky, huggin' the plant
Still represent the people that the Government can't
Still blunt in the hand, still comin' again
Still touring and competin', eatin' grub in the van
Mr. S to the P-I-Z-Y, be my guest
If you wanna just pass me the Backwood
Wrapped and book me a two time sweatshirt
Covered in the hair from the feline, I'm ba-ack
I don't lie when I spit, I rhyme fa-a-a-acts (Fuck that)
I'm from the Northeast, where the peeps lack teeth
Where families are inbred like yeast
But they smile in the portrait, violent divorces
Plants in the house, got ants in the couch
Where the single dads workin' just to snuggle the kids
And the single moms twerkin', workin' double the shifts
If you don't got no money, you don't get to compete
So the shit is in me to rep the citizen [?]
So they listen to my vision when it's hittin' a beat
Because I spit for the weak till I'm forbidden to speak
It's Dankonia, looking opposite of California
East of route NH3, but not Ammonia

[Outro]
You know what I'm saying? We just really trying to revive the whole Hip-Hop game"

From the corner store to the corridor (corridor)
Me and my homie on the dance floor
White girl in the middle, looking like an Oreo

Roof on fire, we can burn up
Turn down for what, nigga turn up
Motherfucker must ain't learn nothin'
Back in the day used to down with a burn coat

Walk in the club and her ass start clappin'
Tell shawty I want an encore

Too Cool To DanceEden XO,"[Verse 1]
You know I'm always looking fly
Never wear the same outfit twice
I don't even have to try
Bitches better recognize
Won't catch me waiting in a queue
In and out, merci beaucoup
I like boys with attitude
Skinny jeans and good tattoos

Got this tan in Monaco
Got these bangs in Tokyo
Went there for a fashion show
Yohji sat me in front row
Champagne kisses bubbly
If you take me home you can cuddle me
Platinum lightning in my eyes
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind

I CryFlo Rida,"[Chorus: Flo Rida & Brenda Russell]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and surviors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Gettin' mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was destined

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Brenda Russell]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
Cuz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feelin', Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldn't panic

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Brenda Russell]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no

I cry, just a little

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up the the ceiling

When I need a healing, I just look up the the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now

Let Me Love You (Until You Learn To Love Yourself)Ne-Yo,"[Verse 1]
Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

[Chorus]
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness gets brought to life
I'll take you there
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby, oh
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you, oh

It's been there for quite a while
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile
I would like to show you what true love can really do

And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you ""no"", but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop"", but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you (Making me love you)

I Knew You Were Trouble.Taylor Swift,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame

Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by by by

The A TeamEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Alternate Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die"
Don't You Worry ChildSwedish House Mafia,"[Verse 1: John Martin]
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

[Bridge: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Hook: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

[Verse 2: John Martin]
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend

Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed

Some Nightsfun.,"[Chorus 1]
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's alright
(That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I?

[Chorus 2]
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge 1]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No
When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

[Bridge 2]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

[Outro]
The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh"
Girl On FireAlicia Keys,"[Verse 1]
She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

Everybody stands, as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world

Little ThingsOne Direction,"[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam & Both]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I’ll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn and Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry & Harry and Louis & Harry and Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry and Niall & Harry]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge: Niall]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things"
DaylightMaroon 5,"[Verse 1]
Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own

In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

Catch My BreathKelly Clarkson,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

[Chorus]
Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

[Verse 2]
Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

[Chorus]
Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

[Bridge]
You helped me see
The beauty in everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

[Chorus]

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now
It's all so simple now

Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life

Sweet NothingCalvin Harris,"[Verse 1: Florence Welch]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Verse 2: Florence Welch]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

[Outro: Florence Welch]
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing"
Va Va VoomNicki Minaj,"[Verse 1]
Just met a boy, just met a boy, when
He can come inside of my playpen
'Cause he look like a superstar in the making
So, I think that I'm going in for the taking
Hear through the grapevine that he's cakin'

It's TimeImagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Bridge]
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand

We Are Never Ever Getting Back TogetherTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together

WantedHunter Hayes,"[Verse 1]
You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl
I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted

[Verse 2]
Anyone can tell you you're pretty
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

[Chorus]
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby I, wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it

They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?
I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules

[Hook: Usher]
That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow

Tryna keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say ""Women, Weed, and Alcohol""

That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow

If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup, lift your lighters, a toast to life

I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time

And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice

Now
Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""

Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-

Second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's 50 dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope

Remember When (Push Rewind)Chris Wallace,"I'm sitting with an empty glass and a broken heart
Thinking to myself , ""What have I done?""
Cause as my future got bright, we started losing light
And I couldn't see that you were the one

So can we push push push rewind?
Go go back in time
When we were kids sneaking bottles of wine
Take take take me back, I wanna go back
Back to what we had!

Do you remember when we started this mess?
My heart was beating out of my chest!
Remember when we stole your dad's car?
I never thought we'd take it that far

So why'd we ever say goodbye?
Remember when we, when we, had it all?
Do you remember when?

Wish I was still the only one running cross your mind
I guess I just want you to know
Oh from your ruby lips to your fingertips
I can't believe I let you go

So can we push push push rewind?
Go go back in time
When we were kids sneaking bottles of wine
Take take take me back, I wanna go back
Back to what we had!

Remember when we, when we, had it all?
Do you remember when?

I'm hanging by a thread
I'm tearing at the seams
Holding on to what we used to be!
And I should let you go...
But I just won't give up up up up up up up!

Push push push rewind
Go go back in time
When we were kids sneaking bottles of wine
Take take take me back, I wanna go back
Back to what we had!

Do you remember when we started this mess?
My heart was beating out of my chest! (My heart was beating out of my chest!)
Remember when we stole your dad's car?
I never thought we'd take it that far

And we were flying so high, yeah, partners in crime
So why'd we ever say goodbye?
Remember when we, when we, had it all?
Do you remember when?"

Feel AgainOneRepublic,"[Verse 1]
It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I had 'til my feet went numb
Prayin' like a fool that's been on the run
Heart's still beating, but it's not working
It's like a million-dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reached out trying to love, but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb

[Pre-Chorus]
But with you
I feel again
Yeah, with you
I can feel again
Yeah

I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me

A long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool who just shot a gun
Heart still beating, but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reached out trying to love, but I feel nothing
Oh, my heart is numb

Anything Could HappenEllie Goulding,"[Verse 1]
Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Verse 2]
After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its color

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen

Little TalksOf Monsters And Men,"[Refrain: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Verse 1: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Bridge: Nanna, Ragnar]
You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

Hey! Don't listen to a word I say

Let you get ahead stand on top but then
I take you down like a heat seekin missile
Break ya in half like a ceramic floor tile
Then give a evil grin (grr) no smile
You like a gecko pokin a sleepin crocodile
Get ready im gonna attack
Andrews killin the track
Hes pissed off for no reason

Perfect on every play lookin like jon Beason
Killed ya with practice comeback next season

Hook 1x

Leavin my legacy
Sayin theres no stoppin me
Destroyed ya immedietly
Oh shit

Verse 2

Rap was meant to be fast paced
Tie my opponents in a knot no escape

Ya know I mean the lyricall stylings of the ace

Im still goin the distance Now you tell me to WAIT
Dont care how much time you plan waste

Before you get a chance to write yours

Cus im on cloud nine your ridin in a hearse

Am I speaking gibberish or are you slow and im nerd
That means ya can't understand a word that im sayin
And these lyrics ain't even hard who the fuck am I slayin
I believe my lyrics are over playin
Erased and rewritten in crayon
And played by a Martian whos sayin damn
This is goin further then I had planned
This song was only 2 verses now im thinkin man
So when I toss these lyrics up lets see how many deals I land
And this is just a scrimmage not even a real game
Im still goin in tryin to take ya dame
Steal the fame
So think of 50 ways to say goodbye bud
Haha TRAIN
So was this lame
Or have I just placed the frame

I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, but just had to touch it
And it's so so fine, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watching (High)
‘Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)

Now we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things

Uh!
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
…aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
Uh!
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel, Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'USSÉ's on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her ‘cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh! Uh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines

Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)

And you'll show up again next summer, yeah!

I Will WaitMumford,"[Verse 1]
Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

[Bridge]
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Hook]
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess

[Hook]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 3]
So I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

[Bridge]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you"

Words like those won't steal your glow
You're one in a million

This, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you've been told

When I Was Your ManBruno Mars,"[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"

When you walk my way
I feel a rush come over me

Keep cool, stay young

If I walk away
I feel a push inside of me
That won't let me leave
But what could I say
For you to feel what's inside of me
This happens all the time

I'm better just pretending I was the fool (hear me out)

Carry Onfun.,"[Verse 1]
Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

[Verse 2]
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

[Bridge]
Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge 2]
Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

[Outro]
No one's ever gonna stop us now"
AliveKrewella,"[Verse 1: Jahan]
Let's make this fleeting moment last forever
So, tell me what you're waiting for?
I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever
There's no regretting anymore
It's worth the wait, even so far away
I'm making the night mine until the day I die
No light to brake when you're hanging by fate
You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind

[Chorus: Jahan]
All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive
(Feel alive...)

[Verse 2: Yasmine]
Meet me under shining lights
I've been waiting right here all my life
Feelings
You can't deny that you're living, open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
Come on, make me feel until the pain don't matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what I've been chasing after

[Chorus: Jahan]
All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive
(Feel alive...)

[Chorus: Jahan]
All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive

But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you mean

C'mon Let Me RideSkylar Grey,"[Intro: Skylar Grey]
And the wheels go around and 'round, and 'round

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
If you got a sweet tooth, you can taste my watermelons
If the swingset bores you, I can show you all my talents
I can wear a tan like other bitches can't
You can have all this, boy and there’s only one thing that I want from you

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike
(Ha-ha!)

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid
If you get a bee sting, I can suck out all the poison
I can make you last like other bitches can’t
Have I made it clear, boy?
There's only one thing that I want from you, hey

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
I’m only fucking with you
Fuck you for thinking it’s true
I’m not like the sluts in this town
They make me blech in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
‘Cause you’re the boy that I like
It’s like I’m a sellout for you
But your bike’s so shiny and new (Shiny and new)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
She’s distracted, by my reflectors
Man, I can tell this chick’s attracted
My wheels spoke to her, my Schwinn is a chick magnet
Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shagging’s not something I'm a pro at, but I ain’t practicing shit
Allen Iverson of safe sex
Condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy is to have you land where the kickstand is
Got this bitch gaggin’, they call me the broad killer
I’m the cousin of Godzilla
‘Cause I spit fire and my dick’s draggin', zig-zaggin' up the avenue
Pullin’ these chicks in my antagonist wagon, screamin’

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh

[Verse 1]
B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
But my songs know what you did in the dark

[Chorus]
So light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the dark, dark

[Verse 2]
The writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

[Pre-Chorus]
My songs know what you did in the dark

[Chorus]
So light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up, light e'm up, up, up

As Your FriendAfrojack,"[Verse 1]
I just can't live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Don't ask me why 'cause there are too many things

[Chorus]
And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend

Oh, lil' ma-mama, I can feel your fire
You're poisonous, lady, let me take you higher
And I don't care if it's a bad time
Just label me the bad guy tonight

And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend

I came to party hoping that you would fall in love
I don't mean to put no pressure on you
Everybody loves a molly and the DJ, he's getting drunk
Trying to get next to you

[Chorus]
And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend

Baby, you the best 'cause you worked me out
I keep building walls up, but you tear 'em down
I'm fighting, I don't wanna like it, but you know I like it
But you know I like it, like it, like it

But you got an AK and you're blowing through

I want you to know it, know it, know it

I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge, I don't care!
I love it, I don't care!

I, I can't really explain what is is she does
But um, yeah, whatever it is, it's um
Whatever it is, it's simply amazing

Her head is on my chest, the sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face
Beautiful in every way, you are

[Pre-Chorus]
See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
And how we play fight up in the bathroom
Next thing you know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me and it's simply amazing
Amazing, mazing

The girl's a work of art and I can't help but stare
With the smile like the sunset and an ocean as her hair
Ooh, what she do ain't fair
Ooh and she know me better than I know myself

See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'd be damned, if I don't believe in us
Like when I said ""I love you"" for the first time
And the tears dropped from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change, no

She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are

There is nothing in this world
That can keep me away from you
And there's nobody
Who could ever compare to you, oh

Heart AttackDemi Lovato,"[Intro]
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won’t wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 2]
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It’s just not fair
Pain’s more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Bridge]
The feelings are lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
And there's no one else to blame
So scared, I'll take off in a run
I'm flying too close to the sun and I'll burst into flames

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

Just Give Me A ReasonP!nk,"[Verse 1: P!nk]
Right from the start
You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine

Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind

Now you've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

You’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & P!nk]
Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again"
22Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks

Everything will be alright if (ooh) you keep me next to you

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you"

I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

Next To MeEmeli Sande,"[Verse 1]
You won’t find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out ’til three
You won’t ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
You won’t find him tryna change the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Chorus]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Verse 2]
When the money’s spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know that there’s no need for me to panic
'Cause I’ll find him, I’ll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need’s a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

[Chorus]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

[Verse 3]
When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we’ve spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Chorus]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

Hey, hey, hey
Good to see you
Come on, dude, let's go

Ha-ha-ha-ha alright
Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back (back) pack (pack), fat (fat) cat (cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry, as you give up all the lies

[Verse 1]
High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

[Verse 2]
Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?

Lego HouseEd Sheeran,"[Verse 1]

My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love

Aren't you somethin' to admire?

The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

Would look at us all the time

CruiseFlorida Georgia Line,"[Intro]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

[Interlude]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise

I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

[Drop]
I need your love

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

All the years, all the times

And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free"

So, I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it
I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

[Verse 1: Kristo]
I’m like “Girl whatcha doin for today?”
Im thinking maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I don’t believe in love at first sight
But after seein’ you baby maybe I might
'Cause when you walked by. I knew you we’re my type
The apple of my eye. You’re flyer than a kite
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny
But (but) I’m just warmin’ up
Look at you, look at you, all dolled up
Look at me, Look at me, gettin’ caught up
Goin’ down, goin’ down, yeah I’m shot up
But hopefully, you got a number I can call up
And if you do girl, that be super
These chicks hot, but you’re so much cooler
And I was hoping she would give me a chance
She walked by and didn’t gimme a glance. Damn

So, I told her like oh darlin'

Yeah, yeah, I said “Girl whatcha doin’ on the weekend”
And she said “I don’t even know depends”
But you’re the one that I’ve been seein’ in my dreams and
Maybe we can get together in the evening
I know we just met but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, I’ll put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, I’ll be in the deep end
Ha, your beauty got me sinkin’
Got me sayin’ “all this shit” without thinkin’
I probably sound like I spent the night drinking
Or these are lines that I’m always repeatin’
But it’s the heart on my sleeve
That wanna know if your might have a spare key
But if you’re a heartbreaker then please spare me
Damn, she was apparently

Same LoveMacklemore,"[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient
Love is kind
Love is patient
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

Still Into YouParamore,"[Verse 1]
Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together

Make you feel, make you feel better

It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

Cause after all this time, I'm still into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever

[Pre-Chorus]
And after all this time, I'm still into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

[Bridge]
Some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time

I'm into you
Baby not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

Yeah, uh, feels good, don't it? Listen, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I wanna do something right
But we can do something better
Ain’t no time like tonight
And we ain’t trying to save it ’til later
Stay out here living the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow
And you got that lil’ something I like
A little something I’ve been wanting to borrow
Tonight the night’s, come on surrender
I won’t lead your love astray, astray, yeah
Your love’s a weapon
Give your body some direction
That’s my aim, then we could

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Take back the night
Come on, use me up until there’s nothing left
Take back the night
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can’t catch your breath
Take back the night
Ooh, don’t know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling’s right, raise your glass and let’s

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Take back the night, take back the night

You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud

One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over

Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water

Outta NowherePitbull,"[Chorus: Danny Mercer]
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me?
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
I seen my past life and politely passed
But I’m already planning on doin' it big
For my life after death and live my life after death
Baby, what you think all the training is for?
Just to properly prepare you for war
So I keep you on your toes
If you look out for them friends that are really foes
This career tried to swallow us (Swallow us)
Paparazzi tried to follow us (Follow us)
I’m everything my momma was
Rider, survivor, a motherfuckin fighter
Thank god for this rapping shit (Thank you)
Forget the cash it's about happiness
Normal life that’s for the birds
I work hard so you never say these words

[Chorus: Danny Mercer]
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me?
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
The critics goin' nowhere (Nowhere)
Thinking that they know me like the Bible, oh hell no
But they don’t understand me all well
Snitching is a sport now, so please, do tell
The world I raise hell
Yeah, I did the crime, but I skip jail
I’m just trying to own teams, get it player
And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire
The world is ours, baby
It’s just waiting for us so don’t be late (Late)
And we can both aim for the sky
And shoot for the stars and call it a date
Now you know that I know that we know
If the world wants war, cock back and reload
A normal life, that’s for the birds
I work hard, so you never say these words

[Chorus: Danny Mercer]
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me?
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere"

I said, ""Can you give it back to me?""
She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams""

[Chorus: All]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

[Verse 2: Liam & Harry & Niall]
Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I said, ""Can I take you home with me?""
She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams""

[Chorus: All]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

[Bridge: Louis & Zayn & Harry]
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced, how we danced
1, 2 - 1, 2, 3

[Chorus: All & (Zayn) & Harry]
How we danced all night to the best song ever
(How we danced!)
We knew every line now I can't remember
(We knew every line)
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
We danced, we danced
And it goes something like this
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
(I know that I won't forget her)
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
(Best song ever!)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You’re like a needle in a haystack
I wanna sit you where my face at
Lunch with a few Mai Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can’t really predict love
Now you’re getting this dick, love
I’m looking for you with a flashlight
I want to feel what a real fat ass feel like
No injection, I learned my lesson
I walk it like I talk it, baby, this pedestrian
Runnin’ through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy pop like (boom!) go get me a burner
Got shot like (boom!)
This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You’re cotton candy, I need a fistful
I’m awful antsy, hope that convince you

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Hey, girl
You know you're lookin' so damn fly
You lookin' like you fell from the sky (Angel)
You know you make a grown man cry
I wanna give it to you, tonight
And make everything you fantasize
Come true, ooh baby
I'll make it so, so, so amazing
I'll give it to you, tonight
And make everything you fantasize
Come true, ooh baby
I'll make it so, so, so amazing
I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you"
GorillaBruno Mars,"[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling, tell me ""Daddy, it's yours""
Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT, we don't stop
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, ""Give it to me baby
Give it to me, motherfucker!""

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Bridge]
I bet you never ever felt so good, so good

You, you, you...

[Chorus]
Oho, you with me, baby, making love like gorillas

You and me baby, making love like gorillas

[Live Verse]
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe
I just want one smile, want one smile, want one smile, babe
Once I lay besides you, girl, I will make you scream, ""yeah, yeah""
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe
I just want one smile, want one smile, want one smile, babe
Once I get inside you, girl, I will make you scream, ""yeah, yeah, yeah""
Come on (etc.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah"
BerzerkEminem,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)

CloserTegan And Sara,"[Verse 1]
All I want to get is a little bit closer
All I want to know is
Can you come a little closer?
Here comes the breath before we get
A little bit closer
Here comes the rush before we touch
Come a little closer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The doors are open, the wind is really blowing
The night sky is changing overhead

[Chorus]
It’s not just all physical
I’m the type who won't get oh so critical
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical

[Verse 2]
All you think of lately is getting underneath me
All I dream of lately is how to get you underneath me
Here comes the heat before we meet
A little bit closer
Here comes the spark before the dark
Come a little closer

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The lights are off and the sun is finally setting
The night sky is changing overhead

[Chorus 2]
It’s not just all physical
I’m the type who won't get oh so critical
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical
I want you close
I want you
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I want you close
I want you
I won’t treat you like you’re typical

[Bridge]
Here come the dreams of you and me
Here come the dreams
Here come the dreams of you and me
Here come the dreams

[Chorus 2]
It’s not just all physical
I’m the type who won't get oh so critical
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical
I want you close
I want you
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I want you close
I want you
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I won’t treat you like you’re typical

All I want to get is a little bit closer

Can you come a little closer?"
True LoveP!nk,"[Verse 1: P!nk]
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face
There's no one quite like you
You push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus: P!nk]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
Just once please try not to be so mean
Repeat after me now R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on, I'll say it slowly (romance)
You can do it babe!

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus: P!nk]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

[Interlude: P!nk]
I think it must be love (I love you)
I think it must be love (I love you)

[Bridge: Lily Allen]
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you I'm incomplete

[Chorus: P!nk]
I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you (like you)
No one else can break my heart like you (like you)
No one else can break my heart like you"
Miss Movin' OnFifth Harmony,"[Music Video]

[Verse 1: Camila & Lauren]
I'm breaking down, gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying good-bye
My eyes are finally dry
I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me, but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

[Pre-Chorus: Camila]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lauren & Dinah & (Normani)]
I broke the glass that surrounded me (surrounded me)
I ain't the way you remember me (remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more
I jumped the fence to the other side, (the other side)
My whole world was electrified (electrified)
Now I'm now longer afraid
It's Independence Day
(It's Independence Day)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on

[Bridge: Dinah & (Normani)]
Everything is changing
And I never want to go back
To the way it was (the way it was)
I'm finding out who I am and who I am
From here on out is gonna be enough (gonna be enough)
Is gonna be enough...

I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

This Is What It Feels LikeArmin van Buuren,"[Verse 1: Trevor Guthrie]
Nobody here knocking at my door
The sound of silence I can’t take anymore
Nobody ringing my telephone now
Oh how I miss such a beautiful sound

[Hook: Trevor Guthrie]
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like
Oh, oh, oh
This is what it feels like

[Verse 2: Trevor Guthrie]
Nothing to hold but the memories and frames
Oh they remind me of the battle I face
Without your love, without you I drown
Somebody save me I’m going down

[Hook: Trevor Guthrie]
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like
Oh, oh, oh
This is what it feels like

[Hook: Trevor Guthrie]
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it down the road with one headlight
No I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now

Pretty Brown EyesCody Simpson,"(Go to sleep, wake up)
(You're pretty with no makeup)

I like this right here

(Go to sleep, wake up)
(You're pretty with no makeup)

This girl she came 'round
The corner, looking like a model
Magazine figure, she was shaped like a bottle
Long straight hair, she was fly as a bird
First time ever I was lost for words

Felt so right, couldn't be wrong
Love at first sight if that exists at all
I couldn't move, felt like I was stuck
And then baby girl looked up

And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?

(Go to sleep, wake up)
(You're pretty with no makeup)
(Go to sleep, wake up)

This girl she was a lil hottie
She know she got it
Came from the city so she loves to party
The JT song make her move that body
She dancing all night long

Cause I can tell that she was a wild one
That's why I was shy at first
But I finally worked up the nerve

And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?

Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little little little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you

Like hey hey little pretty brown eyes
Don't you ever be looking at them other guys
Cause ain't never had a surfer like me
Start swimming over here and ride my wave
Cause I see that you party like there's no tomorrow
Let's leave the party, I'll grab my guitar
I got the keys, so jump in my car
Sit back relax, Australia's kinda far

Hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Whatcha doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?

Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little little little bit of time with you

What NowRihanna,"[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-ohh
What now?

[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Please tell me)
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Somebody tell me)
What now?

Rough WaterTravie McCoy,"[Chorus: Jason Mraz & (Travie McCoy)]
Hey yo, never let go of me (Yeah)
Hold tight; it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, baby)
I will never let you drown (Never)
Even if we're going down
Hey yo, never let go of me (It's Travie)
When I'm sinkin'

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Let's go!
Loose lips sink ships, that's what someone told me
But this boat will stay afloat for as long as you hold me
We been through rough water, anytime it was tougher
But the fact I came back to remind you I love ya
And if that's not enough, well I can one up ya
I pinky promise, touch thumbs, I'll never make you suffer
And all I ask in return is some reciprocation
I'll be your oxygen when you're running out of patience
So take a deep breath, and hold it tight
My heart is yours, just reassure me that you'll hold it right
Don't be offended, I'm just the cautious type
To always be around and hold you down and never under, like

Hey yo, never let go of me (Ha, never let go)
Hold tight; it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, baby, hold tight)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
This is my message in a bottle, I hope that you receive it
If it washes up at your feet then open it and read it
To whom it may concern, insert your name here
It's destiny that we were both born in the same year
Three months apart, but on the same sphere
Staring at the sun, inhaling the same air
This type of love we got, they'll never get it
I'll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet
Sometimes I panic, but I never take it for granted
I'll hold you 'til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic
And if I lose my grip, then just promise me this
You'll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & (Travie McCoy)]
Hey yo, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, mama, hold tight)
And I will never let you drown (Nah)
Even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey yo, never let go of me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, Like)
When I'm sinkin'

Oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge: Travie McCoy & (Jason Mraz)]
There's times where like... we find it hard to hold on to something
That was never meant to be held onto (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But you let it go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If it comes back, it was meant to be (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If not, just let it be (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Hey yo, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, mama, hold tight)
I will never let you drown (Nah)

Crooked SmileJ. Cole,"[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

My Kind Of LoveEmeli Sande,"[Produced by Craze & Hoax, Danny Keyz & Emile]

[Verse 1]
I can't buy your love, don't even wanna try
Sometimes the truth won't make you happy, still, I'm not gonna lie
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

[Verse 2]
I know I'm far from perfect, nothing like your entourage
I can't grant you any wishes, I won't promise you the stars
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

[Chorus]
'Cause when you've given up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That''s when you feel my kind of love
And when you're crying out
When you've fallen and can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love

[Verse 3]
You won't see me at the parties, I guess I'm just no fun
I won't be turning up the radio singing ""Baby You're The One""
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

[Verse 4]
I know sometimes I get angry, and I say what I don't mean
I know I keep my heart protected, far away from my sleeve
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you

[Chorus]
'Cause when you've given up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That''s when you feel my kind of love
And when you're crying out
When you've fallen and can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love
'Cause when you've given up
When no matter what you do, it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That's when you feel my kind of love
And when you're crying out
When you've fallen and can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love"

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe

[Verse 1: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you’re on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don’t mind a drive-thru
That’s why I got you
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
I’ll always be right there
I’ll always be right there
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby, you got it babe"

Yellow diamonds in the light

It Will RainBruno Mars,"[Verse 1]
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, ""There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy""
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
And pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
And just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain"
The One That Got AwayKaty Perry,"[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away"

Yes I can, doubt better leave, I'm runnin' with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sip—dot com
Now I gotta word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S. to Taiwan
Now who can say that? I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling it's a rap, ASAP

The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second I'ma strike all you
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

[Chorus: Etta James]
Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Without YouDavid Guetta,"[Verse 1: Usher]
I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you

Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you

Stereo HeartsGym Class Heroes,"[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no—

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh, oh)

5 O'ClockT-Pain,"[Hook: Lily Allen]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 1: T Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me textses
Like, ""Boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time
She might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (aw, aw, aw)
And then ask me kindly (aw, aw, aw)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And yet we wake up singing the same song

And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs
(I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (All right)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

And these missed calls
And you texting me like, ""I'mma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?""

It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
Conversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)
You said you'd go into bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs
(I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (All right)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club
For me to leave here with one of them, that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib
(It’s 5′O Clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less cause I’m sure you’re the best
You’re the one, so I let you, thats how you show me love
And when we finish you like “damn, babe you woke me up”
I like you way you put it down likes its for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing thats coming up

[Hook: Lily Allen & (T Pain)]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)

Someone Like YouAdele,"[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
I'll remember, you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
I'll remember, you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
I'll remember, you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
I'll remember, you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""

Mr. Know-It-All
Well ya, you think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it, ain't it something, y'all?
When somebody tells you something 'bout you
Think that they know you more than you do
So you take it down, another pill to swallow

Mr. Bring-Me-Down
Well ya, ya like to bring me down, don't ya?

Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby, you don't know a thing about me

You don't know a thing about me

Only got yourself to blame
When you want me back again
But I ain't falling back again
'Cause I'm living my truth without your lies

Not Over YouGavin DeGraw,"[Verse 1]
Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

[Bridge]
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

Marry The NightLady Gaga,"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I won’t give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness
I'm a winner
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love
In my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry

[Bridge]
Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
Cause that's where we make love
Come on run
Turn the car on and run

[Chorus 2]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Set Fire To The RainAdele,"[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]
Oh, oh, no
Let it burn
Oh, oh, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn"
DominoJessie J,"[Verse 1]
I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm 'bout to explode

[Pre-Chorus]
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing, like I'm running 'cause you're taking me there
Don't you know you spin me out of control?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, c'mon

Boom me like a bass drum, sparking up a rhythm
Baby, c'mon

[Chorus]
Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

[Verse 2]
You got me losing my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing, like I'm running 'cause you're taking me there
Don't you know you spin me out of control?

Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right
Ooh baby, baby, dancing in the moonlight
Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right

Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known

Take me down like I'm a domino"
HeadlinesDrake,"[Produced by Boi-1da and Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yelling out ""Money over everything!""
""Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…

[Skit]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better"

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low

I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am

Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Well straight up, I tell ya

SKR let me define it
South Kak Rebel still remain defient
Underrated but ill still fluxuate the climate
Talkin north pole cole zip up ya hyvent
Can you even register half the stuff that I vent
Just then to ascend like advent raising
Bringing evil to your residents like da tyrant
Flip my lid pressurized flow like a hydrant so that makes me suited for the hose
Live line on ladder 49, she's sliding down the pole
And that should be the Headline, cuz thats something they know
Keep the opposition's vision obsolete therefore thats OVO
Triangulate my position from using spokeo
Southern rapper but my influence was sent from Tokyo
Hajmemashite to my foes with no intro just ikuzo
You been Dismissed gone slit your let it trickle slow

HeartbeatThe Fray,"[Verse 1]
We're on an open bed truck on the highway
Rain is coming down and we're on the run
Think I can feel the breath in your body
We got to keep on running 'til we see the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fire and it's burning in the rain
Thought that it went out but it's burning just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause if you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

[Chorus]
I feel your heartbeat
You're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same
I feeling your heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to put it all back together
I got a story and I'm trying to tell it right
I got the kerosene and the desire
I'm trying to start a flame in the heart of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you got a fire and it's burnin' in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause if you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

[Chorus]
I feel your heartbeat
You're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same

I want to kiss your scars tonight
You got to try, you got to let me in

Ass Back HomeGym Class Heroes,"[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Oh, it's so sexy, yo

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, ok, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck - 'cause they be swallowin' it

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)
(Mama, I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Interlude: Travie McCoy]
No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the ""us"" in ""trust"", baby
Ahh, let's go!

[Bridge: Neon Hitch]
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Or when you're coming home (Ok)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm home now, baby, let's go)
To our front door (Uh-huh)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going
Just get your ass back home

Just A KissLady Antebellum,"[Verse 1]
Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile

[Verse 2]
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

[Verse 3]
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real, no, it's never felt so right

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

[Bridge]
No, I don't wanna say goodnight
I know it's time to leave
But you'll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far

Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, oh

FlyNicki Minaj,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'll kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become near when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' their own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanye's

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

"Young, Wild & FreeSnoop Dogg","[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Is this thing on? Word

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby, you don't know me, ’cause you're dead wrong

I'm glad you came (Came, came, came)

[Verse: Nathan Sykes]
You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see
You and me

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Parker]
Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

[Chorus: All]
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came

[Verse: Siva Kaneswaran]
You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see
You and me

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

[Chorus: All]
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came

I'm glad you came
So glad you came

Take CareDrake,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost"
Sorry For Party RockingLMFAO,"[Chorus]
Sorry for Party Rocking

[Verse 1]
Yo, I be up in a party looking for a hottie to bone

Part Of MeKaty Perry,"[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Bridge]
Now look at me, I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won’t ever put me out again
I’m glowing, oh whoa

It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no (Away from me)
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul (My soul)
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Outro]
This is the part of me (No)
Away from me (No)
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
No
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no"

Drive ByTrain,"[Verse 1]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

[Verse 2]
On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

[Bridge]
Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

[Pre-Chorus]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause...

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by"

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves
Of my heart
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Oooooooh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

DisasterJoJo,"[Verse 1]
I'm trying not to pretend
That it won't happen again and again like that
I never thought it would end
'Cause you got up in my head, in my head like that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And made me happy, baby
Love is crazy, so amazing
But it's changing, re-arranging
I don't think I can take anymore

[Chorus]
'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always
You gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster
Oh whoa

[Verse 2]
I didn't want it this way
I only wanted to say I loved you right
But now you're walking away nd leaving me here to stay
So foolish of me to wait for you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To realize all the things I gave you
Made you, changed you
Your dreams came true when I met you
Now forget you, don't want anymore

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around

You shot the bullet, you shot the bullet that killed me
Not feeling my heartbeat and now it's dying
I been through it, I-I been through all the agony
And now my eyes are drying, trying, no more crying
Lying's just a game
So disaster strikes and I'm alright
'Cause my love's on its way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Burning up forever and always, always
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never (and now we're saying never)

Wild OnesFlo Rida,"[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones (Wild ones, wild ones)
Oooh

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music
I might lose it
Glass to the roof
That's how we does it
I don't care tonight
She don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live
Ain't no surprise
Take me so high
Jump and nose dive
Surfing the crowd
Oooh-ooohh
Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band
Mic check one two-oooh
Shut 'em down in the club while the playboy does
And they all get loose, loose
After bottle, we all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shut down: a hundred super models

[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones (Wild ones, wild ones)
Oooh

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Party rocker, fa' sho' stopper
More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me high pain
Tolerance, bottoms up when the champagne
My life, call my hanna to be explain
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones (Wild ones, wild ones)
Oooh

[Bridge 1: Sia]
I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and lets begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And I'm on the prowl

[Bridge 2: Flo Rida]
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body
Dominate you 'til you've had enough
I can't lie
The wilds don't lie

[Chorus: Sia]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones (Wild ones, wild ones)
Oooh

[Outro: Sia]
I am a wild one; break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one; tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl"
Brighter Than The SunColbie Caillat,"[Verse 1]
Stop me on the corner
Swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?
With it
Don't you blink; you might miss it
See, we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say...

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

[Verse 2]
I'd never seen it
But I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
You better believe
I'm gonna treat it better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
Read it, it's signed and delivered, let's seal it
Boy, we go together like peanuts and Paydays
Marley and reggae
And everybody needs to get a chance to say...

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

[Bridge]
Everything is like a white out
'Cause we shika-shika shine down
Even when the, when the light's out, but I can see you glow
Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before

I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts (This is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (Lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky (Falling from the sky)
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts (This is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (Lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want (Shining how we want)
Brighter than the sun

Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Oh-o, yeah, oh-o

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun"
A Thousand YearsChristina Perri,"[Verse 1]
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Can't move my lips, but my heart is screaming

We Are Youngfun.,"[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter

So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise the cup
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

What Makes You BeautifulOne Direction,"[Verse 1: Liam]

You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

So GoodB.o.B,"[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa

Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby

She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you
And boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)

[Verse 2]
She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Bless your soul)
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core

Somebody That I Used To KnowGotye,"[Hook]

[Verse 1: Dcoy Link]
Good girls might scandal
When you ridin' bad bitches on your bike handle
When days are dark friends make like eggs and scramble
Life's a bitch but she pretty from the right angle
Guns blazing, that's how I'm going out
Niggas wishing I was gone should light a candle
Make a wish and blow it out
I'm no magician no pulling rabbits outta hats
But I could pull a dagger out and stab it in a back
I got 'em catchin' high notes and they don't sing too well
Don't trust friendship cause Ships sink and I don't swim too well
That nigga bitch got ass but he a bitch ass nigga
Put some money on her ass now she shit cash nigga
She hot as hell she probably the devil's bitch
But if I got her sucking mine then who's sucking the devil's dick
I'm like the twin towers right before they leveled it
I might just blow up but fuck it I ain't celibate
They making they breast bigga all these body building hoes
If I wasn't rapping i'd be lifting weights but I ain't talking body building though
I got the whip doing gymnastics
The wheels stop spinning then the top do a back flip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cas]
I believed in ya
Thought I really needed ya
Damn she a trip Travelocity, Expedia
Hella hard headed now let's make it way easier
You thought you knew it all call her mrs. Wikipedia
Thought she was a keepa
Promise to neva leava
But honestly I ain't good with promises and she ain't neither
You wanted me for yourself
I played along it didn't help
But I guess this what I do I cheetos, Chester cheetah
I ain't ashton kutcher and you ain't watching punk'd
Put her to the test and yeah she motherfuckin' flunked
I had her blowing on my shit like it's a blunt
I ain't taking shots at you this a slam dunk
But as far as the jokes go
She said I never find a chick like her
God I hope so
Had a chance but you blew it I'm not surprised
Though I made you cry I was just doing me cuz I'm obliged"

Call Me MaybeCarly Rae Jepsen,"[Verse 1]
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby

But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

NakedDev,"[Verse 1: Dev & Enrique Iglesias]
You got a girl that doesn't look a thing like me
The girl your mother always said it would be
So, you could say that, you could say that I'm hopeless
But that ain't the girl, that ain't the girl I want you to be
The girl that keeps me up and I see in my dreams
So, you could say that, you could say that I love her

[Pre-Chorus: Dev & Enrique Iglesias]
So I don't care what they say, it's our life, life, life
We can dance if we want, make it feel alright
Temperature's rising, I feel the fire
Tonight, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Dev & Enrique Iglesias, Both]
Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up?
Even with no make up, I don't wanna fake it
And you don't gotta doubt a second if I miss you
Every time I'm with you, I feel naked

You say you got it, what you gon' do with it?

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias & Dev]
If I told you, ""Girl, come and run away with me""
Now would you throw it all away for me?
I need to know that, need to know that it's not over
'Cause you were the boy Daddy told you to stay away from me
But you're nothing but a fantasy
I need to know that, need to know that
You'd be strong enough to believe in us

Cause I don't care what they say, it's our life, life, life
We can dance if we want, make it feel alright

Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay""
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o

Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?

Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt

Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: doorknob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah

Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Is Anybody Out ThereK'Naan,"[Intro: Nelly Furtado]
I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there, yeah
Don't wanna be left, left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Something 'bout Mary
Never won a pageant
Never felt pretty
Never looked like Cameron
Diaz was her last name
Always been abandoned
Keep your head up
Baby girl this is your anthem
There goes Hannah
Showin' off her banner
Rocking that crown
Make them boys go bananas
When you're insecure about yourself
It's a fact
You can point a finger
But there's three pointing back

[Pre-Hook: K'naan]
I can see her crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?
She's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now she could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
She's crying for your love tonight
Loneliest is hard to survive, she said

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K'naan]
His name was Adam
When his mom had him
Dad was a phantom
Never took a look at him
Grew up mad and
Antisocial
Hated outdoors
Always in playing madden
Adam was lonely
Drugs were the only
Way out of his own life
Now he's slowly
Losing his fire
Close to retire
With one last hope
He puts his arms up higher

[Pre-Hook: K'naan]
I can see him crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?
He's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now he could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
He's crying for your love tonight
Loneliest heart to survive, he said

[Hook:]

[Bridge: Nelly Furtado]
If you feel the way I feel
Like you've been talking to yourself
Well this one's for everyone who's felt invisible
Lonely in a crowded room
Searching for someone like you
Can't do it all alone (no one can baby)
Can't do it all alone (no one should baby)
Is anybody out there?
(somebody, anybody)
Is anybody out there?
I'm right here for your
Is anybody out there?

LightsEllie Goulding,"[Verse 1]
I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Give Your Heart A BreakDemi Lovato,"[Verse 1]
The day I first met you, you told me
You'd never fall in love
But now that I get you, I know fear is what it really was

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now here we are
So close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize, baby, I'm not like the rest?

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

On Sunday, you went home, alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love, but you did not reply

The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake

Don't wanna break your heart (Don't wanna break your heart)
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong

Beekeeper's DaughterThe All-American Rejects,"I’ve been known a thousand ways
Choked a hundred hearts in half as many days
Oh no, I think so
And I get so lost inside this city
You ugly girls all look so pretty
It’s true
What am I supposed to do?

I still got you waiting
Look out your window
What do you see?
You don’t see me

You’re a pretty little flower
I’m a busy little bee
Honey, that’s all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
But then I’m gonna leave
Honey I know you’ll wait for me

You’re all alone but you understand
That we’re too young to start making plans agreeing
Monogamy’s not a part of me
And I know my line and is just a sin
But I swear to you I’m gonna do it again
I’m not making any friends

I just wanted you to wait
There out your window
What do you see?
You don’t see me

Cause you’re a pretty little flower
But I’m a busy little bee
Honey, that’s all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Baby then I’m gonna leave
Honey I know you’ll wait for me

Pulled out your picture the other day
(Oh isn’t that sweet)
You didn’t have that much to say
(Cause it wasn't even me)
Cause I know that you said
I’m better off on my own and I’m better off dead

I just want you there to wait
Look out your window
What do you see?
You don’t see me

Come on, come on, come on
Pretty little flower
I’m a busy little bee
Honey that’s all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Maybe two or maybe three
Honey, I know you’ll wait for me

Honey, that’s all you had to say"

Ah, yeaaaaaeaahhhhhhhh
Ah, yeaaaaaeaahhhhhhhh
Ah, yeaaaaaeaaahhh, yeah, yeah
Come on!

[Verse 1]
Open up my mind with these spoken words
Let this music heal like an overture
Now she’s the only one, one, one
Yeah, and so I roll with her
(Ooooooo) That’s how it’s supposed to be
Living life with loved ones close to me
(Shh, ah) This is the remedy and I got the recipe
I don’t need no Hennessy
Yeah, it’s been 9 months now
Haven’t had a drink
And I’m starting to see clear now
I’m puttin' all my fears down
I can hear the cheers now
Seeing peace signs when I look around

[Hook]
Ay, young homie what you trippin' on?
Lookin' at life like, ""how did I get it wrong?""
Life’s too short, gotta live it long
To my brothers and sisters, when will we get along?
Ay, young homie what you trippin' on?
Lookin' at life like, ""how did I get it wrong?""
Life’s too short, gotta live it long
To my brothers and sisters, when will we get along?

[Verse 2]
Open up your eyes, look around
Homie can you see how it’s going down?
Brothers locked up, Sister’s knocked up
If you wanna build your love up
Put your hate down
(Oooooo) That’s the only way to live
T-t-turnin negatives to positives
“It’s gonna be alright,"" Bob Marley says
Fuck the dumb shit, keep it movin'
That’s what time it is

[Hook]
Ay, young homie what you trippin' on?
Lookin' at life like, ""how did I get it wrong?""

Life’s too short, gotta live it long
To my brothers and sisters, when will we get along?

[Verse 3]
Give peace to the war in the streets
Give peace to the evil d'creeps, yeah
I just ride with my head to the sky
Live life like I’m never gon' die (never gon' die, yeah)
See many fighting and fussin' over nothing
So much destruction, looking at puppets combustin' like nothing
Now listen, it takes education, to change your reputation
From bad to good to getting better, now you’re elevatin'
Babies singing, families hanging, everybody’s chillin'
Not gonna stop this, living on the feeling
Man, this is the real thing
Tell me can you feel me?
Wait til they drop this, dancing on the ceiling

[Bridge]
Ay, young homie what you trippin' on?
Ah, what you really trippin' on?
Life’s too short gotta live it long
To my brothers and sisters when will we get along?

[Hook]
Ay, young homie what you trippin' on?
Lookin' at life like, ""how did I get it wrong?""
Life’s too short, gotta live it long

Eyes OpenTaylor Swift,"[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout

PayphoneMaroon 5,"[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone"

Miami equals
Black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture
Bury a boarder, record-breaker, won't cha
Give credit where credit is due, don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

Baby

Wherever I spin it, that's where I land

Men In Black, I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

HonestlyHot Chelle Rae,"[Verse 1]
Honestly, why are my clothes out on the street?
Honestly, I think you've lost your mind
I can't believe I came home to find my car keyed
Honestly, I'm way too tired to fight
Round and round, drama every time

[Chorus]
I'mma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?

'Cause I'm already gone
I'm already gone

So don't blame me

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone

Girl Gone WildMadonna,"[Spoken Intro]
Oh my God
I am heartly sorry for having offended thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven and the pain of hell
But most of all, because I love thee
And I want so badly to be good

[Verse 1]

And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack

When everybody talks back

It started with a whisper
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
And that was when I kissed her

Wide AwakeKaty Perry,"[Intro]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart (I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong? (I'm wide awake)
And now it’s clear to me
That everything you see
Ain’t always what it seems (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn’t dive in, wouldn’t bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
‘Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

[Verse 2]
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)

[Bridge]
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore

[Interlude]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
You know, I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine

Blow Me (One Last Kiss)P!nk,"[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grasp so
I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick
Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice
I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh
I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious

Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?

I will do what I please
Anything that I want

You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""why's"" will be crystal clear

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious

Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?

And since I got game she wanted to hang

Yeah
Just waking up in the morning and to be well
Quite honest with ya I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?
That's when you press on, Lee Nails
Half the population's just waitin' to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryna freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I be in your corner like Mick, baby, til the end
Or when you hear this song from that big lady

Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home

Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain

Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter

And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds

It's gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs
For you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad

When I look into your eyes

To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love

Out in the streets, we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town

How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do

There's a place that I know
It's not pretty there and few have ever gone
If I show it to you now
Will it make you run away?

Even if I try to push you out, will you return?
And remind me who I really am

Both Of UsB.o.B,"[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us"
Too CloseAlex Clare,"[Verse 1]
You know I'm not one to break promises
I don't want to hurt you, but I need to breathe
At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

[Pre-Chorus]
Which way is right?
Which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're heading separate ways

[Chorus]
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

[Verse 2]
You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's oh so much that you deserve
Nothing to say
Nothing to do
I've nothing to give
I must live without you
You know we're heading separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself

There's nothing I can really say

Only OneSammy Adams,"[Verse 1]
Only one
Only one
Only one
You were so out of my league like I was lost for words
I couldn't even begin to speak right
Not to mention each night couldn't seem to spark that conversation
I kept stalling out just waiting at the green light
Push the clutch and finally broke the damn ice
Would of done it sooner had I knew you were intrigued by me
Had no idea kept making these excuses now your mine
I'm gon' prove it, I'm gon' prove it

[Verse 2]
Girl you were so beyond that fly shit
I can't even tell you or explain how wide my eyes did
When you walk in the room its hard to keep a friendly conversation
Cause everyone's stuck on my chick, my chick
Everyone look at my chick
She got the touch and moves to make me loose it while we grinding
She makes the room light up but that's the last thing on her mind
Told me this would happen I just thought that he was lying

Only one, only one, only one

Cause none of these girls compare to you

Just had to say you're the only one

And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown

So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

Kiss and leave me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Olly Murs]
So, hung up
We can't, let go
If you really have, to leave
One more time just move, me slow

[Pre-Chorus 2: Olly Murs]
So put another record on
Play it on repeat
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Cause all you need to know, is what you do to me
And every time you hold me close, my heart skips, skips a beat

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3: Rizzle Kicks]
Rizzle Kicks, yeah
At the start of the night I was like, what? Let's have a team talk
Playing with this lady isn't something I'd agree for
Vibes keep going up and down like a see-saw
Should have just taken her to the cinema to see Saw
Ooh, she let me sleep with her, I figured her figure's a sure, sure winner
Plus I got a lead from the back, I'm a skipper
You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip a beat (Skip a beat)

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro/Ad-Lib: Olly Murs & (Rizzle Kicks)]
My heart skips, skips a beat
(My heart skips a beat)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
My heart skips, skips a beat"

Million dollar party, now, tell me who you wearing
Lots of new hand held hype you can carry

Now I'm the Fugee of my Lauren Hill that got away
I though we had an at last love, Etta James

Every province I go, city I sleep, it's best that ya’ll know
Running around, and doing all these shows
Round the whole globe, I come, and you go girl

Just wrap for the night, baby, live a bit
With a place to hit, and your pants to zip
You can make a scene and party, are you into it?

All this bubba kush I burn up, smell some regular, it ruined us
Turning corners, fishtailin' out the parking lot yellin'
Bankhead, west side, eight or nine chicks trailin'
Right behind us, been this way since we were minors
If it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch, you wouldn't find us
Even way out in China, same thing when I came through the door
Like, here you go again, where the bitches and the drink, yo

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall

A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles

When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

FireworkKaty Perry,"[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""

Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

It's always been inside of you, you, you

Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough

And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

Just The Way You AreBruno Mars,"[Verse 1: D-Pryde]

She's mine, she's mine
But shes telling me, I'm too good for her
She's hot, she's nice
Like the weather out in California

She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday(I tell her everyday, ugh, I tell her everyday)

I try, I try
To make her see that she's amazing clearer
She says, that she's ugly
And I tell her, girl look at this mirror

Cause everytime she ask me
Boy do I look fly?
I reply (Bruno! Let's go!)

[Hook 1: Bruno Mars]

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops, and stares for a while
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
(yeah~)

[Verse 2: D-Pryde]

(Yeah!)
I want you coming around more for a reason
Personal model for Victoria's Secret
I wait for her like students wait for the weekend
Two can make a kiss, baby you is a ten (dime!)

I'm so attracted to you, and I never lost it (nahh!)
She hates her glasses, I tell her put 'em on it
If love was so stupid than, I'm retarded
To prove that I admit, you're the beautiful list

Baby, you'll always own my heart
Your body is a WOW, OH MY GOD!

A work of art, she's one Picasso
With any shape, or body, she my runway model

I'll never let you step on 'em, new shoes
My number one most viewed, Youtube

I don't know, but baby something is right
Just stay the same, and I'll love you for life, Alright (Cawww!)

[Hook 2: Bruno Mars]

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops, and stares for a while
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are (Bruno! Let's Go!)

The way you are (The way you are)
The Way you are

Girl you're amazing, just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change (there's not a thing girl)
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops, and stares for a while (they stop and stare, baby)
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are (yeah~)

'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go

[Bridge: Vika Jigulina]
When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

[Hook 2: Edward Maya]
I hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside
I haven't seen you smilin' but I'm dying tonight

[Chorus 2: Edward Maya]
I can fix all those lies
Oh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I"

Love Like WoeThe Ready Set,"[Intro]
(J-J-J-J-J-R)
Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh
Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh
I kinda feel like it don't make
Like-like-like it don't make
Feel like it don't make s-s-s-s-sense

[Verse 1]
I'm thinking baby you and I are undeniable
But I'm findin' out love's unreliable
I'm giving all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?
'Cause you're a pretty little windstorm
Out on the boulevard
Something like a sunset
Oh, you're a shooting star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips aren't speaking my name

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break some-
How could I say no?

[Chorus]
She's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Girl's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

[Verse 2]
It's like a hurricane, speed train
She's a moving car
Catch her in the fast lane
Oh, I gotta know
Can I keep up with her pace?
Kick it into gear when I see that face
You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one
That can make a storm cloud break
Pulling out the sun
And I can't get caught in the rain
Can I get your lips to speak my name?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break some-
How could I say no?

[Chorus]
She's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Girl's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

[Bridge]
'Cause we only have one life
The timing and the moment all seem so right
So would you say you're mine?
(We'll be just fine)
Would you say you're mine?
(We'll be just fine)

[Chorus]
She's got a love like woe
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Girl's got a love like woe
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

She's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Girl's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense

Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again (again... again...)"
Coming HomeDiddy - Dirty Money,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Intro: Diddy]
I'm back where I belong (Yeah)
I never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing I can't try
And if you feel me put your hands high (Put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
(Baby, put your hands high)
And you, the dreams are for you

[Verse 1: Diddy]
I hear the ""Tears of a Clown,"" uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs
Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
(I'll be better in the morn')
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place where I belong

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Tell the world that I'm coming home (Yeah)
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday (Ain't no more pain)
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world I'm coming home

[Verse 2: Diddy]
“A House Is Not a Home,” I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (Deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (Ballin')
Baby, we been living in sin
Cause we been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world I'm coming

[Verse 3: Diddy]
I'm almost home, check this out
“Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,” I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruisin through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (Here I stand), a better man (Don't stop)
Thank you, Lord! Thank you all!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Let the rain wash away (Feels so good)
All the pain of yesterday (Feels so free)
I know my kingdom awaits (Ain't no place like home, baby)
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Ain't no place like home)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming"

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""Fuck the world,"" get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
That's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (yeah!)

Back To DecemberTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions, man, we're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked
So, let me thank you for your time and try to not waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast

You sound so innocent, all full of good intent
You swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset
I'm not the one who's lost with no direction, oh
But you'll never see
You're so busy making maps with my name on them in all caps
You've got the talking down, just not the listening

Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be

Got phony phone, got made money
Papers got my ass loking on
Why the hell did you leave?
Where the hell did you go?
Got phony phone, got made money
Papers got my ass loking on

[Verse 3]
I am not misogonystic I am just an asshole
Flavour on my fingertips the chicken and tabasco
Baby drop that ass low
Get it to the dance floor
Whip in the Porche
Big as a horse bring my lasso

Fuck you little fucker
With a pack of rubbers
I ain't really fucking with you clubbers
I don't want your number [?]
The way I see it now it's gonna be a long ass summer
Know I'm flowing
I need and octopussy rather wet
Tricks and they nuff shit to be [?]
Corona in my hand
To pills out the cabinet
If the cops show
Tell the motherfuckers I am not having it

Why the hell did you leave
Where the hell did you go

Come over here and take a closer look (Look)

Who Dat GirlFlo Rida,"[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, Ms. Red Carpet
She can autograph my pockets
Anytime, anyplace, anyway

I don't wanna be obnoxious
But this girl worth the gossip
Take away the smile
The tattoos now, forever she very guardless
I imagine her topless
She might set off my rocket
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Attitude like we arguing
Return I'm gonna celebrate , glitter to my life

Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more, more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep them coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep them coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor

[Bridge]
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up

[Chorus]
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite

Never quitting, don't believe in that

SeptemberDaughtry,"[Verse 1]
How the time passed away, all the trouble that we gave
And all those days we spent out by the lake
Has it all gone to waste? All the promises we made
One by one, they vanish just the same

[Chorus]
Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September, we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end

[Verse 2]
Now it all seems so clear, there's nothing left to fear
So we made our way by finding what was real
Now the days are so long that summer's moving on
We reach for something that's already gone, yeah

[Chorus]
Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September, we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose, but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end

[Bridge]
Yeah, we knew we had to leave this town
But we never knew when
And we never knew how
We would end up here the way we are
Yeah, we knew we had to leave this town
But we never knew when
And we never knew how
We would end up here the way we are

[Chorus]
Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September, we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end

Waiting For The EndLinkin Park,"[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
Holding on to what I haven't got
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear"
MineTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)"
Rhythm of LovePlain White T's,"[Verse 1]
My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says, ""Boy, quit foolin' around""
I told her, ""I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love""

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

[Bridge]
When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum

Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum

[Verse 3]
And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Oh, play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Yeah, sway to the rhythm of love"

You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?

[Verse 1]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin'? No, you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you
Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?

You see right through me

How do you do that shit? How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that

[Verse 2]
What are we doin'? 'Cause you see through me
'Cause you say ""Nicki,"" and I say ""Who me?""
And you say ""No you,"" and I say ""Screw you""
Then you start dressin', and you start leavin'
And I start cryin', and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin - yo!
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin', passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

STOP! oooooh
STOP! oohhhh
Would you just stop lookin through me, 'cause I can't take it
No, I can't take it

I met this girl down the block from me
Used to tell myself she was too hot for me
But then I saw her at the corner store
So I ran on over just to grab the door
I got her number we started chillin (hey)
We started buzzin, we got addicted
Now I, I'm the one she can't live without
I bet that's her right now

Shorty hittin' me up
Says she wanna re-up
Knows I got the best in town
Cuz when she get the shivers
She knows that I'll deliver
I'm the one that holds her down
She's about to break break break break break
And I won't let her wait wait wait wait wait
It's gettin' kinda late late late late late
And she just wanna shake shake shake shake shake

[Verse 2]
One day she started texting me
Asked if she could borrow that recipe
I told her loving you is my specialty
She said well give it up up, give it up up
When she's away it's such a downer
And I miss her every time I'm not around her
Cuz she, she's the one I can't live without
I hope that's her right now

Just A GuyBC Jean,"You're one-dimensional, you don't go that deep
Yeah, you can scream and fight with me half the night and then fall asleep
Yeah, you can wake up thinking nothing's wrong and my bags are packed
Yeah, you can tell me how you'll miss me and not call me back

But I won't cry, why should I?

You're a guy, that's alright
There's nothing more and nothing less, you're what you are, it is what it is
Do your time, there's no crime
I know eventually you'll call, 'cause after all you're just a guy

I like how you flip a switch, you're either off or on, so simple
For me to explain a girl would take a whole other song
If you can give me everything you got to give, you're gonna find
That you can chill out knowin' I'll respect that I'm not on your mind

And I won't cry, why should I? I'll survive

You're a guy, that's alright
There's nothing more and nothing less, you're what you are, it is what it is
Do your time, there's no crime
I know eventually you'll call, 'cause after all you're just a guy

You're just a guy and that's just fine
Do what you do, but just be mine
You drive me mad and that's okay
We have a deal you know

The basic fact is I'm a girl
And you alone can't change the world

'Cause you're just a guy, yeah
You're just a guy
Yay, for it

You're a guy, that's alright
There's nothing more and nothing less, you're what you are, it is what it is
Do your time, there's no crime
I know eventually you'll call, 'cause after all you're just a guy

You're just a guy and that's just fine
Do what you do, but just be mine
You're a guy, that's alright
I know eventually you'll call, 'cause after all you're just a guy"

His husband, poor old A’Hara (Okaroff?) crestfallen by things and down at heels at the time, they squeak, accepted the (Zassnoch!) ardree’s shilling at the conclusion of the Crimean war and, having flown his wild geese, alohned in crowds to warnder on like Shuley Luney, enlisted in Tyrone’s horse, the Irish whites, and soldiered a bit with Wolsey under the assumed name of Blanco Fusilovna Buck-lovitch (spurious) after which the cawer and the marble halls of Pump Court Columbarium, the home of the old seakings, looked upon each other and queth their haven evermore for it transpires that on the other side of the water it came about that on the field of Vasileff’s Cornix inauspiciously with his unit he perished, saying, this papal leafless to old chap give, rawl chaw-clates for mouther-inlouth. Booil. Poor old dear Paul Horan, to satisfy his literary as well as his criminal aspirations, at the suggestion thrown out by the doomster in loquacity lunacy, so says the Dublin Intelligence, was thrown into a Ridley’s for inmates in the northern counties. Under the name of Orani he may have been the utility man of the troupe capable of sustaining long parts at short notice. He was. Sordid Sam, a dour decent deblancer, the unwashed, haunted always by his ham, the unwished, at a word from Israfel the Summoner, passed away painlessly after life’s upsomdowns one hallowe’en night, ebbrous and in the state of nature, propelled from Behind into the great Beyond by footblows coulinclouted upon his oyster and atlas on behanged and behooved and behicked and behulked of his last fishandblood bedscrappers, a Northwegian and his mate of the Sheawolving class. Though the last straw glimt his baring this stage thunkhard is said (the pitfallen gagged him as ‘Promptboxer’) to have solemnly said — as had the brief thot but fell in till his head like a bass dropt neck fust in till a bung crate (cogged!): Me drames, O’Loughlins, has come through!

Bhi she. Again, if Father San Browne, tea and toaster to that quaint-esttest of yarnspinners is Padre Don Bruno, treu and troster to the queen of Iar–Spain, was the reverend, the sodality director, that eupeptic viceflayer, a barefaced carmelite, to whose palpi-tating pulpit (which of us but remembers the rarevalent and hornerable Fratomistor Nawlanmore and Brawne.) sinning society sirens (see the [Roman Catholic] presspassim) fortunately became so enthusiastically attached and was an objectionable ass who very occasionally cockaded a raffles ticket on his hat which he wore all to one side like the hangle of his pan (if Her Elegance saw him she’d have the canary!) and was semiprivately convicted of mal-practices with his hotwashed tableknife (glossing over the cark in his pocket) that same snob of the dunhill, fully several year-schaums riper, encountered by the General on that redletter morning or maynoon jovesday and were they? Fuitfuit.

When Phishlin Phil wants throws his lip ’tis pholly to be fortune flonting and whoever’s gone to mix Hotel by the salt say water there’s nix to nothing we can do for he’s never again to sea. It is nebuless an autodidact fact of the commonest that the shape of the average human cloudyphiz, whereas sallow has long daze faded, frequently altered its ego with the possing of the showers (Not original!). Whence it is a slopperish matter, given the wet and low visibility (since in this scherzarade of one’s thousand one nightinesses that sword of certainty which would indentifide the body never falls) to idendifine the individuone in scratch wig, squarecuts, stock lavaleer, regattable oxeter, baggy pants and shufflers (he is often alluded to as Slypatrick, the llad in the llane) with already an incipience (lust!) in the direction of area baldness (one is continually firstmeeting with odd sorts of others at all sorts of ages!) who was asked by free boardschool shirkers in drenched coats overawall, Will, Conn and Otto, to tell them overagait, Vol, Pov and Dev, that fishabed ghoatstory of the haardly creditable edventyres of the Haberdasher, the two Cur-chies and the three Enkelchums in their Bearskin ghoats!

Sport’s a common thing. It was the Lord’s own day for damp (to wait for a postponed regatta’s eventualising is not of Battlecock Shettledore — Juxta — Mare only) and the request for a fully armed explanation was put (in Loo of Pat) to the porty (a native of the sisterisle — Meathman or Meccan? — by his brogue, ex-race eyes, lokil calour and lucal odour which are said to have been average clownturkish (though the capelist’s voiced nasal liquids and the way he sneezed at zees haul us back to the craogs and bryns of the Silurian Ordovices) who, the lesser pilgrimage accomplished, had made, pats’ and pigs’ older inselt, the south-east bluffs of the stranger stepshore, a regifugium persecutorum, hence hindquarters) as he paused at evenchime for some or so minutes (hit the pipe dannyboy!

Having reprimed his repeater and resiteroomed his timespiece His Revenances, with still a life or two to spare for the space of his occupancy of a world at a time, rose to his feet and there, far from Tolkaheim, in a quiet English garden (commonplace!), since known as Whiddington Wild, his simple intensive curolent vocality, my dearbraithers, my most dearbrathairs, as he, so is a supper as is a sipper, spake of the One and told of the Compassionate, called up before the triad of precoxious scaremakers (scoretaking: Spegulo ne helpas al mal-bellulo, Mi Kredas ke vi estas prava, Via dote la vizago rispondas fraulino) the now to ushere mythical habiliments of Our Farfar and Arthor of our doyne.

When they set fire then she’s got to glow so we may stand some chances of warming to what every soorkabatcha, tum or hum, would like to know. The first Humphrey’s latitu-dinous baver with puggaree behind, (calaboose belong bigboss belong Kang the Toll) his fourinhand bow, his elbaroom surtout, the refaced unmansionables of gingerine hue, the state slate umbrella, his gruff woolselywellesly with the finndrinn knopfs and the gauntlet upon the hand which in an hour not for him solely evil had struck down the might he mighthavebeen d’Est-erre of whom his nation seemed almost already to be about to have need.

The angelus hour with ditchers bent upon their farm usetensiles, the soft belling of the fallow deers (doereh-moose genuane!) advertising their milky approach as midnight was striking the hours (letate!), and how brightly the great tri-bune outed the sharkskin smokewallet (imitation!) from his frock, kippers, and by Joshua, he tips un a topping swank cheroot, none of your swellish soide, quoit the reverse, and how manfally he says, pluk to pluk and lekan for lukan, he was to just pluggy well suck that brown boyo, my son, and spend a whole half hour in Havana.

The house of Atreox is fallen indeedust (Ilyam, Ilyum! Mae-romor Mournomates!) averging on blight like the mundibanks of Fennyana, but deeds bounds going arise again. Life, he himself said once, (his biografiend, in fact, kills him verysoon, if yet not, after) is a wake, livit or krikit, and on the bunk of our bread-winning lies the cropse of our seedfather, a phrase which the establisher of the world by law might pretinately write across the chestfront of all manorwombanborn. The scene, refreshed, reroused, was never to be forgotten, the hen and crusader ever-intermutuomergent, for later in the century one of that puisne band of factferreters, (then an excivily (out of the custom huts) (retired), (hurt), under the sixtyfives act) in a dressy black modern style and wewere shiny tan burlingtons, (tam, homd and dicky, quopriquos and peajagd) rehearsed it, pippa pointing, with a dignified (copied) bow to a namecousin of the late archdeacon F.

Preserved Coppinger (a hot fellow in his night, may the mouther of guard have mastic on him!) in a pullwoman of our first transhibernian with one still sadder circumstance which is a dirkandurk heartskewerer if ever to bring bouncing brimmers from marbled eyes. Cycloptically through the windowdisks and with eddying awes the round eyes of the rundreisers, back to back, buck to bucker, on their airish chaunting car, beheld with intouristing anterestedness the clad pursue the bare, the bare the green, the green the frore, the frore the cladagain, as their convoy wheeled encirculingly abound the gigantig’s lifetree, our fire-leaved loverlucky blomsterbohm, phoenix in our woodlessness, haughty, cacuminal, erubescent (repetition!) whose roots they be asches with lustres of peins. For as often as the Archicadenus, pleacing aside his Irish Field and craving their auriculars to re-cepticle particulars before they got the bump at Castlebar (mat and far!) spoke of it by request all, hearing in this new reading of the part whereby, because of Dyas in his machina, the new garrickson’s grimacing grimaldism hypostasised by substintuation the axiomatic orerotundity of that once grand old elrington bawl, the copycus’s description of that fellowcommuter’s play upon countenants, could simply imagine themselves in their bo-som’s inmost core, as pro tem locums, timesported acorss the yawn — ing (abyss), as once they were seasiders, listening to the cockshy — shooter’s evensong evocation of the doomed but always ventri — loquent Agitator, (nonot more plangorpound the billows o’er Thounawahallya Reef!) silkhouatted, a whallrhosmightiadd, a-ginsst the dusk of skumring, (would that fane be Saint Muezzin’s calling — holy places! — and this fez brimless as brow of faithful toucher of the ground, did wish it were — blessed be the bones! — the ghazi, power of his sword.) his manslayer’s gunwielder protended towards that overgrown leadpencil which was soon, monumentally at least, to rise as Molyvdokondylon to, to be, to be his mausoleum (O’dan stod tillsteyne at meisies aye skould show pon) while olover his exculpatory features, as Roland rung, a wee dropeen of grief about to sillonise his jouejous, the ghost of resignation diffused a spectral appealingness, as a young man’s drown o’er the fate of his waters may gloat, similar in origin and akkurat in effective to a beam of sunshine upon a coffin plate.

But in the pragma what formal cause made a smile of that to-think? Who was he to whom? (O’Breen’s not his name nor the brown one his maid.) Whose are the placewheres?

What regnans raised the rains have levelled but we hear the pointers and can gauge their compass for the melos yields the mode and the mode the manners plicyman, plansiman, plousiman, plab.

We’ll sit down on the hope of the ghouly ghost for the titheman troubleth but his hantitat hies not here. They answer from their Zoans; Hear the four of them! Hark torroar of them!

Be-fore he fell hill he filled heaven: a stream, alplapping streamlet, coyly coiled um, cool of her curls: We were but thermites then, wee, wee. Our antheap we sensed as a Hill of Allen, the Barrow for an People, one Jotnursfjaell: and it was a grummelung amung the porktroop that wonderstruck us as a thunder, yunder.

Thus the unfacts, did we possess them, are too imprecisely few to warrant our certitude, the evidencegivers by legpoll too untrustworthily irreperible where his adjugers are semmingly freak threes but his judicandees plainly minus twos. Neverthe-less Madam’s Toshowus waxes largely more lifeliked (entrance, one kudos; exits, free) and our notional gullery is now com-pletely complacent, an exegious monument, aerily perennious. Oblige with your blackthorns; gamps, degrace! And there many have paused before that exposure of him by old Tom Quad, a flashback in which he sits sated, gowndabout, in clericalease ha-bit, watching bland sol slithe dodgsomely into the nethermore, a globule of maugdleness about to corrugitate his mild dewed cheek and the tata of a tiny victorienne, Alys, pressed by his limper looser.

Yet certes one is. Eher the following winter had overed the pages of nature’s book and till Ceadurbar-atta-Cleath became Dablena Tertia, the shadow of the huge outlander, maladik, mult-vult, magnoperous, had bulked at the bar of a rota of tribunals in manor hall as in thieves’ kitchen, mid pillow talk and chithouse chat, on Marlborough Green as through Molesworth Fields, here sentenced pro tried with Jedburgh justice, there acquitted con testimony with benefit of clergy. His Thing Mod have undone him: and his madthing has done him man. His beneficiaries are legion in the part he created: they number up his years. Greatwheel Dunlop was the name was on him: behung, all we are his bisaacles. As hollyday in his house so was he priest and king to that: ulvy came, envy saw, ivy conquered. Lou! Lou! They have waved his green boughs o’er him as they have torn him limb from lamb. For his muertification and uxpiration and dumnation and annu-hulation. With schreis and grida, deprofound souspirs. Steady, sullivans! Mannequins pause! Longtong’s breach is fallen down but Graunya’s spreed’s abroad. Ahdostay, feedailyones, and feel the Flucher’s bawls for the total of your flouts is not fit to fan his fettle, O! Have a ring and sing wohl! Chin, chin! Chin, chin! And of course all chimed din width the eatmost boviality. Swiping rums and beaunes and sherries and ciders and negus and cit — ronnades too. The strongers. Oho, oho, Mester Begge, you’re about to be bagged in the bog again. Bugge. But softsies seuf-sighed: Eheu, for gassies! But, lo! lo! by the threnning gods, human, erring and condonable, what the statues of our kuo, who is the messchef be our kuang, ashu ashure there, the unforgettable treeshade looms up behind the jostling judgements of those, as all should owe, malrecapturable days.

Tap and pat and tapatagain, (fire firstshot, Missiers the Refusel-eers! Peingpeong! For saxonlootie!) three tommix, soldiers free, cockaleak and cappapee, of the Coldstream. Guards were walking, in (pardonnez-leur, je vous en prie, eh?) Montgomery Street. One voiced an opinion in which on either wide (pardonnez!), nod-ding, all the Finner Camps concurred (je vous en prie, eh?). It was the first woman, they said, souped him, that fatal wellesday, Lili Coninghams, by suggesting him they go in a field. Wroth mod eldfar, ruth redd stilstand, wrath wrackt wroth, confessed private Pat Marchison retro. (Terse!) Thus contenters with san-toys play. One of our coming Vauxhall ontheboards who is resting for the moment (she has been callit by a noted stagey ele-cutioner a wastepacket Sittons) was interfeud in a waistend pewty parlour. Looking perhaps even more pewtyflushed in her cherry- derry padouasoys, girdle and braces by the halfmoon and Seven Stars, russets from the Blackamoor’s Head, amongst the climbing boys at his Eagle and Child and over the corn and hay emptors at their Black and All Black, Mrs F . . . A . . . saidaside, half in stage of whisper to her confidante glass, while recoopering her cartwheel chapot (ahat! — and we now know what thimbles a baquets on lallance a talls mean), she hoped Sid Arthar would git a Chrissman’s portrout of orange and lemonsized orchids with hollegs and ether, from the feeatre of the Innocident, as the worryld had been uncained. Then, while it is odrous comparisoning to the sprangflowers of his burstday which was a virid — able goddinpotty for the reinworms and the charlattinas and all branches of climatitis, it has been such a wanderful noyth untirely, added she, with many regards to Maha’s pranjapansies. (Tart!) Prehistoric, obitered to his dictaphone an entychologist: his pro-penomen is a properismenon. A dustman nocknamed Seven — churches in the employ of Messrs Achburn, Soulpetre and Ashreborn, prairmakers, Glintalook, was asked by the sisterhood the vexed question during his midday collation of leaver and buckrom alternatively with stenk and kitteney phie in a hash-housh and, thankeaven, responsed impulsively: We have just been propogandering his nullity suit and what they took out of his ear among my own crush. All our fellows at O’Dea’s sages with Aratar Calaman he is a cemented brick, buck it all! A more nor usually sober cardriver, who was jauntingly hosing his runabout, Ginger Jane, took a strong view. Lorry hosed her as he talked and this is what he told rewritemen: Irewaker is just a plain pink joint reformee in private life but folks all have it by brehemons laws he has parliamentary honours. Eiskaffier said (Louigi’s, you know that man’s, brillant Savourain): Mon foie, you wish to ave some homelette, yes, lady! Good, mein leber!

A perspirer (over sixty) who was keeping up his tennises panted he kne ho har twa to clect infamatios but a diffpair flannels climb wall and trespassing on doorbell. After fullblown Braddon hear this fresky troterella! A railways barmaid’s view (they call her Spilltears Rue) was thus expressed: to sympathisers of the Dole Line, Death Avenue, anent those objects of her pity-prompted ministrance, to wet, man and his syphon. Ehim! It is ever too late to whissle when Phyllis floods her stable.

Well done, Drumcollakill! Kitty Tyrrel is proud of you, was the reply of a B.O.T. official (O blame gnot the board!) while the Daughters Benkletter mur-mured in uniswoon: Golforgilhisjurylegs! Brian Lynsky, the cub curser, was questioned at his shouting box, Bawlonabraggat, and gave a snappy comeback, when saying: Paw! Once more I’ll hellbowl! I am for caveman chase and sahara sex, burk you! Them two bitches ought to be leashed, canem! Up hog and hoar hunt! Paw! A wouldbe martyr, who is attending on sanit Asitas where he is being taught to wear bracelets, when grilled on the point, revealed the undoubted fact that the consequence would be that so long as Sankya Moondy played his mango tricks under the mysttetry, with shady apsaras sheltering in his leaves’ licence and his shadowers torrifried by the potent bolts of indradiction, there would be fights all over Cuxhaven. (Tosh!) Missioner Ida Womb-well, the seventeenyearold revivalist, said concerning the coinci — dent of interfizzing with grenadines and other respectable and disgusted peersons using the park: That perpendicular person is a brut! But a magnificent brut! ‘Caligula’ (Mr Danl Magrath, bookmaker, wellknown to Eastrailian poorusers of the Sydney Parade Ballotin) was, as usual, antipodal with his: striving todie, hopening tomellow, Ware Splash. Cobbler. We have meat two hourly, sang out El Caplan Buycout, with the famous padre’s turridur’s capecast, meet too ourly, matadear! Dan Meiklejohn, precentor, of S.S. Smack and Olley’s was probiverbal with his upsiduxit: mutatus mutandus. Dauran’s lord (‘Sniffpox’) and Moir-gan’s lady (‘Flatterfun’) took sides and crossed and bowed to each other’s views and recrossed themselves. The dirty dubs upin their flies, went too free, echoed the dainly drabs downin their scenities, una mona. Sylvia Silence, the girl detective (Meminerva, but by now one hears turtlings all over Doveland!) when supplied with informations as to the several facets of the case in her cozy-dozy bachelure’s flat, quite overlooking John a’Dream’s mews, leaned back in her really truly easy chair to query restfully through her vowelthreaded syllabelles: Have you evew thought, wepow-tew, that sheew gweatness was his twadgedy? Nevewtheless ac — cowding to my considewed attitudes fow this act he should pay the full penalty, pending puwsuance, as pew Subsec. 32, section II, of the C. L.

Jarley Jilke began to silke for he couldn’t get home to Jelsey but ended with: He’s got the sack that helped him moult instench of his gladsome rags. Meagher, a naval rating, seated on one of the granite cromlech setts of our new fish-shambles for the usual aireating after the ever popular act, with whom were Questa and Puella, piquante and quoite, (this had a cold in her brain while that felt a sink in her summock, wit’s wat, wot’s wet) was encouraged, although nearvanashed himself, by one of his co-affianced to get your breath, Walt, and gobbit and when ther chidden by her fastra sastra to saddle up your pance, Naville, thus cor replied to her other’s thankskissing: I lay my two fingerbuttons, fiancee Meagher, (he speaks!) he was to blame about your two velvetthighs up Horniman’s Hill — as hook and eye blame him or any other piscman? — but I also think, Puellywally, by the siege of his trousers there was some-one else behind it — you bet your boughtem blarneys — about their three drummers down Keysars Lane. (Trite!).
Be these meer marchant taylor’s fablings of a race referend with oddman rex? Is now all seenheard then forgotten? Can it was, one is fain in this leaden age of letters now to wit, that so diversified outrages (they have still to come!) were planned and partly carried out against so staunch a covenanter if it be true than any of those recorded ever took place for many, we trow, beyessed to and denayed of, are given to us by some who use the truth but sparingly and we, on this side ought to sorrow for their pricking pens on that account. The seventh city, Urovivla, his citadear of refuge, whither (would we believe the laimen and their counts), beyond the outraved gales of Atreeatic, changing clues with a baggermalster, the hejirite had fled, silentioussue-meant under night’s altosonority, shipalone, a raven of the wave, (be mercy, Mara!

For mine qvinne I thee giftake and bind my hosenband I thee halter. The wastobe land, a lottuse land, a luctuous land, Emerald-illuim, the peasant pastured, in which by the fourth commandment with promise his days apostolic were to be long by the abundant mercy of Him Which Thundereth From On High, murmured, would rise against him with all which in them were, franchisab-les and inhabitands, astea as agora, helotsphilots, do him hurt, poor jink, ghostly following bodily, as were he made a curse for them, the corruptible lay quick, all saints of incorruption-of-an holy nation, the common or ere-ingarden castaway, in red re-surrection to condemn so they might convince him, first pha — roah, Humpheres Cheops Exarchas, of their proper sins.

(perorhaps!)

We seem to us (the real Us!) to be reading our Amenti in the sixth sealed chapter of the going forth by black. It was after the show at Wednesbury that one tall man, humping a suspicious parcel, when returning late amid a dense particular on his home way from the second house of the Boore and Burgess Christy Menestrels by the old spot, Roy’s Corner, had a barkiss revolver placed to his faced with the words: you’re shot, major: by an unknowable assailant (masked) against whom he had been jealous over, Lotta Crabtree or Pomona Evlyn. More than that Whenn the Waylayer (not a Lucalizod diocesan or even of the Glenda-lough see, but hailing fro’ the prow of Little Britain), mention — ing in a bytheway that he, the crawsopper, had, in edition to Reade’s cutless centiblade, a loaded Hobson’s which left only twin alternatives as, viceversa, either he would surely shoot her, the aunt, by pistol, (she could be okaysure of that!) or, failing of such, bash in Patch’s blank face beyond recognition, pointedly asked with gaeilish gall wodkar blizzard’s business Thornton had with that Kane’s fender only to be answered by the aggravated assaulted that that that was the snaps for him, Midweeks, to sultry well go and find out if he was showery well able. But how trans-paringly nontrue, gentlewriter! His feet one is not a tall man, not at all, man. No such parson. No such fender. No such lumber. No such race. Was it supposedly in connection with a girls, Myramy Huey or Colores Archer, under Flaggy Bridge (for ann there is but one liv and hir newbridge is her old) or to explode his twelvechamber and force a shrievalty entrance that the heavybuilt Abelbody in a butcherblue blouse from One Life One Suit (a men’s wear store), with a most decisive bottle of single in his possession, seized after dark by the town guard at Haveyou-caught-emerod’s temperance gateway was there in a gate’s way.

Fifthly, how parasoliloquisingly truetoned on his first time of hearing the wretch’s statement that, muttering Irish, he had had had o’gloriously a’lot too much hanguest or hoshoe fine to drink in the House of Blazes, the Parrot in Hell, the Orange Tree, the Glibt, the Sun, the Holy Lamb and, lapse not leashed, in Ramitdown’s ship hotel since the morning moment he could dixtinguish a white thread from a black till the engine of the laws declosed unto Murray and was only falling fillthefluthered up against the gatestone pier which, with the cow’s bonnet a’top o’it, he falsetook for a cattlepillar with purest peaceablest intentions. Yet how lamely hobbles the hoy of his then pseudo-jocax axplanation how, according to his own story, he vas a process server and was merely trying to open zozimus a bottlop stoub by mortially hammering his magnum bonum (the curter the club the sorer the savage) against the bludgey gate for the boots about the swan, Maurice Behan, who hastily into his shoes with nothing his hald barra tinnteack and came down with homp, shtemp and jumphet to the tiltyard from the wastes a’sleep in his obi ohny overclothes or choker, attracted by the norse of guns playing Delandy is cartager on the raglar rock to Dulyn, said war’ prised safe in bed as he dreamed that he’d wealthes in mor-mon halls when wokenp by a fourth loud snore out of his land of byelo while hickstrey’s maws was grazing in the moonlight by hearing hammering on the pandywhank scale emanating from the blind pig and anything like it (oonagh!oonagh!) in the whole history of the Mullingcan Inn he never. This battering babel allower the door and sideposts, he always said, was not in the very remotest like the belzey babble of a bottle of boose which would not rouse him out o’ slumber deep but reminded him loads more of the martiallawsey marses of foreign musi-kants’ instrumongs or the overthrewer to the third last days of Pompery, if anything. And that after this most nooningless knockturn the young reine came down desperate and the old liffopotamus started ploring all over the plains, as mud as she cud be, ruinating all the bouchers’ schurts and the backers’ wischandtugs so that be the chandeleure of the Rejaneyjailey they were all night wasching the walters of, the weltering walters off. Whyte.

Just one moment. A pinch in time of the ideal, musketeers! Alphos, Burkos and Caramis, leave Astrelea for the astrollajerries and for the love of the saunces and the honour of Keavens pike puddywhackback to Pamintul. And roll away the reel world, the reel world, the reel world! And call all your smokeblushes, Snowwhite and Rosered, if you will have the real cream! Now for a strawberry frolic! Filons, filoosh! Cherchons la flamme! Famm-famm! Fammfamm!

Come on, ordinary man with that large big nonobli head, and that blanko berbecked fischial ekksprezzion Machinsky Scapolo-polos, Duzinascu or other. Your machelar’s mutton leg’s getting musclebound from being too pulled. Noah Beery weighed stone thousand one when Hazel was a hen. Now her fat’s falling fast. Therefore, chatbags, why not yours? There are 29 sweet reasons why blossomtime’s the best. Elders fall for green almonds when they’re raised on bruised stone root ginger though it winters on their heads as if auctumned round their waistbands. If you’d had pains in your hairs you wouldn’t look so orgibald. You’d have Colley Macaires on your lump of lead. Now listen, Mr Leer! And stow that sweatyfunnyadams Simper! Take an old geeser who calls on his skirt. Note his sleek hair, so elegant, tableau vivant. He vows her to be his own honeylamb, swears they will be papa pals, by Sam, and share good times way down west in a guaranteed happy lovenest when May moon she shines and they twit twinkle all the night, combing the comet’s tail up right and shooting popguns at the stars. Creampuffs all to dime! Every nice, missymackenzies! For dear old grumpapar, he’s gone on the razzledar, through gazing and crazing and blazing at the stars. Compree! She wants her wardrobe to hear from above by return with cash so as she can buy her Peter Robinson trousseau and cut a dash with Arty, Bert or possibly Charley Chance (who knows?) so tolloll Mr Hunker you’re too dada for me to dance (so off she goes!) and that’s how half the gels in town has got their bottom drars while grumpapar he’s trying to hitch his braces on to his trars. But old grum he’s not so clean dippy between sweet you and yum (not on your life, boy! not in those trousers! not by a large jugful!) for someplace on the sly, where Furphy he isn’t by, old grum has his gel number two (bravevow, our Grum!) and he would like to canoodle her too some part of the time for he is downright fond of his number one but O he’s fair mashed on peaches number two so that if he could only canoodle the two, chivee chivoo, all three would feel genuinely happy, it’s as simple as A. B. C., the two mixers, we mean, with their cherrybum chappy (for he is simply shamming dippy) if they all were afloat in a dreamlifeboat, hugging two by two in his zoo-doo-you-doo, a tofftoff for thee, missymissy for me and howcameyou-e’enso for Farber, in his tippy, upindown dippy, tiptoptippy canoodle, can you? Finny.

Ack, ack, ack. With which clap, trap and soddenment, three to a loaf, our mutual friends the fender and the bottle at the gate seem to be implicitly in the same bateau, so to singen, bearing also several of the earmarks of design, for there is in fact no use in putting a tooth in a snipery of that sort and the amount of all those sort of things which has been going on onceaday in and twiceaday out every other nachtistag among all kinds of pro-miscious individuals at all ages in private homes and reeboos publikiss and allover all and elsewhere throughout secular sequence the country over and overabroad has been particularly stupendous. To be continued. Federals’ Uniteds’ Transports’ Unions’ for Exultations’ of Triumphants’ Ecstasies.

But resuming inquiries. Will it ever be next morning the postal unionist’s (officially called carrier’s, Letters Scotch, Limited) strange fate (Fierceendgiddyex he’s hight, d.e., the losel that hucks around missivemaids’ gummibacks) to hand in a huge chain envelope, written in seven divers stages of ink, from blanch-essance to lavandaiette, every pothook and pancrook bespaking the wisherwife, superscribed and subpencilled by yours A Laugh-able Party, with afterwite, S.A.G., to Hyde and Cheek, Eden — berry, Dubblenn, WC? Will whatever will be written in lappish language with inbursts of Maggyer always seem semposed, black looking white and white guarding black, in that siamixed twoa-talk used twist stern swift and jolly roger? Will it bright upon us, nightle, and we plunging to our plight? Well, it might now, mircle, so it light. Always and ever till Cox’s wife, twice Mrs Hahn, pokes her beak into the matter with Owen K. after her, to see whawa smutter after, will this kiribis pouch filled with litterish frag-ments lurk dormant in the paunch of that halpbrother of a herm, a pillarbox?

The coffin, a triumph of the illusionist’s art, at first blench naturally taken for a handharp (it is handwarp to tristinguish jubabe from jabule or either from tubote when all three have just been invened) had been removed from the hardware premises of Oetzmann and Nephew, a noted house of the gonemost west, which in the natural course of all things continues to supply funeral requisites of every needed description. Why needed, though? Indeed needed (wouldn’t you feel like rattanfowl if you hadn’t the oscar!) because the flash brides or bride in their lily boleros one games with at the Nivynubies’ finery ball and your upright grooms that always come right up with you (and by jingo when they do!) what else in this mortal world, now ours, when meet there night, mid their nackt, me there na-ket, made their nought the hour strikes, would bring them right — came back in the flesh, thumbs down, to their orses and their hashes.

To proceed. We might leave that nitrience of oxagiants to take its free of the air and just analectralyse that very chymerical com-bination, the gasbag where the warderworks. And try to pour somour heiterscene up thealmostfere. In the bottled heliose case continuing, Long Lally Tobkids, the special, sporting a fine breast of medals, and a conscientious scripturereader to boot in the brick and tin choorch round the coroner, swore like a Norewheezian tailliur on the stand before the proper functionary that he was up against a right querrshnorrt of a mand in the butcher of the blues who, he guntinued, on last epening after delivering some car-casses mattonchepps and meatjutes on behalf of Messrs Otto Sands and Eastman, Limericked, Victuallers, went and, with his unmitigated astonissment, hickicked at the dun and dorass against all the runes and, when challenged about the pretended hick (it was kickup and down with him) on his solemn by the imputant imputed, said simply: I appop pie oath, Phillyps Captain. You did, as I sostressed before. You are deepknee in error, sir, Madam Tomkins, let me then tell you, replied with a gentlewomanly salaam MackPartland, (the meatman’s family, and the oldest in the world except nick, name.) And Phelps was flayful with his peeler. But his phizz fell.

Now to the obverse. From velveteens to dimities is barely a fivefinger span and hence these camelback excesses are thought to have been instigated by one or either of the causing causes of all, those rushy hollow heroines in their skirtsleeves, be she ma-gretta be she the posque. Oh! Oh! Because it is a horrible thing to have to say to say to day but one dilalah, Lupita Lorette, short-ly after in a fit of the unexpectednesses drank carbolic with all her dear placid life before her and paled off while the other soiled dove that’s her sister-inlove, Luperca Latouche, finding one day while dodging chores that she stripped teasily for binocu-lar man and that her jambs were jimpjoyed to see each other, the nautchy girly soon found her fruitful hat too small for her and rapidly taking time, look, she rapidly took to necking, partying and selling her spare favours in the haymow or in lumber closets or in the greenawn ad huck (there are certain intimacies in all ladies’ lavastories we just lease to imagination) or in the sweet churchyard close itself for a bit of soft coal or an array of thin trunks, serving whom in fine that same hot coney a la Zingara which our own little Graunya of the chilired cheeks dished up to the greatsire of Oscar, that son of a Coole. Houri of the coast of emerald, arrah of the lacessive poghue, Aslim-all-Muslim, the resigned to her surrender, did not she, come leinster’s even, true dotter of a dearmud, (her pitch was Forty Steps and his perch old Cromwell’s Quarters) with so valkirry a licence as sent many a poor pucker packing to perdition, again and again, ay, and again sfidare him, tease fido, eh tease fido, eh eh tease fido, toos top-ples topple, stop, dug of a dog of a dgiaour, ye! Angealousmei! And did not he, like Arcoforty, farfar off Bissavolo, missbrand her behaveyous with iridescent huecry of down right mean false sop lap sick dope? Tawfulsdreck! A reine of the shee, a shebeen quean, a queen of pranks. A kingly man, of royal mien, regally robed, exalted be his glory! So gave so take: Now not, not now! He would just a min. Suffering trumpet! He thought he want. Whath? Hear, O hear, living of the land! Hungreb, dead era, hark! He hea, eyes ravenous on her lippling lills. He hear her voi of day gon by. He hears! Zay, zay, zay! But, by the beer of his profit, he cannot answer. Upterputty till rise and shine! Nor needs none shaft ne stele from Phenicia or Little Asia to obelise on the spout, neither pobalclock neither folksstone, nor sunkenness in Tomar’s Wood to bewray how erpressgangs score off the rued. The mouth that tells not will ever attract the unthinking tongue and so long as the obseen draws theirs which hear not so long till allearth’s dumbnation shall the blind lead the deaf. Tatcho, tawney yeeklings! The column of lumps lends the pattrin of the leaves behind us. If violence to life, limb and chattels, often as not, has been the expression, direct or through an agent male, of womanhid offended, (ah! ah!), has not levy of black mail from the times the fairies were in it, and fain for wilde erthe blothoms followed an impressive private reputation for whispered sins?

Now by memory inspired, turn wheel again to the whole of the wall. Where Gyant Blyant fronts Peannlueamoore There was once upon a wall and a hooghoog wall a was and such a wall-hole did exist. Ere ore or ire in Aaarlund. Or you Dair’s Hair or you Diggin Mosses or your horde of orts and oriorts to garble a garthen of Odin and the lost paladays when all the eddams ended with aves. Armen?

And let oggs be good old gaggles and Isther Estarr play Yesther Asterr. In the drema of Sorestost Areas, Diseased. A stonehinged gate then was for another thing while the suroptimist had bought and enlarged that shack under fair rental of one yearlyng sheep, (prime) value of sixpence, and one small yearlyng goat (cadet) value of eight-pence, to grow old and happy (hogg it and kidd him) for the re — minants of his years; and when everything was got up for the purpose he put an applegate on the place by no means as some pretext a bedstead in loo thereof to keep out donkeys (the pig-dirt hanging from the jags to this hour makes that clear) and just thenabouts the iron gape, by old custom left open to prevent the cats from getting at the gout, was triplepatlockt on him on purpose by his faithful poorters to keep him inside probably and possibly enaunter he felt like sticking out his chest too far and tempting gracious providence by a stroll on the peoplade’s egg-day, unused as he was yet to being freely clodded.

O, by the by, lets wee brag of praties, it ought to be always remembered in connection with what has gone before that there was a northroomer, Herr Betreffender, out for his zimmer hole-digs, digging in number 32 at the Rum and Puncheon (Branch of Dirty Dick’s free house) in Laxlip (where the Sockeye Sammons were stopping at the time orange fasting) prior to that, a Kom-merzial (Gorbotipacco, he was wreaking like Zentral Oylrubber) from Osterich, the U.S.E. paying (Gaul save the mark!) II/— in the week (Gosh, these wholly romads!) of conscience money in the first deal of Yuly wheil he was, swishing beesnest with bles-sure, and swobbing broguen eeriesh myth brockendootsch, making his reporterage on Der Fall Adams for the Frankofurto Siding, a Fastland payrodicule, and er, consstated that one had on him the Lynn O’Brien, a meltoned lammswolle, disturbed, and wider he might the same zurichschicken other he would, with tosend and obertosend tonnowatters, one monkey’s damages become. Now you must know, franksman, to make a heart of glass, that the game of gaze and bandstand butchery was merely a Patsy O’Strap tissue of threats and obuses such as roebucks raugh at pinnacle’s peak and after this sort. Humphrey’s unsolicited visitor, Davy or Titus, on a burgley’s clan march from the middle west, a hikely excellent crude man about road who knew his Bullfoost Mountains like a starling bierd, after doing a long dance untidled to Cloudy Green, deposend his bockstump on the waityoumay-wantme, after having blew some quaker’s (for you! Oates!) in through the houseking’s keyhole to attract attention, bleated through the gale outside which the tairor of his clothes was hog-callering, first, be the hirsuiter, that he would break his bulshey — wigger’s head for him, next, be the heeltapper, that he would break the gage over his lankyduckling head the same way he would crack a nut with a monkeywrench and, last of all, be the stirabouter, that he would give him his (or theumperom’s or any-bloody else’s) thickerthanwater to drink and his bleday steppe — brodhar’s into the bucket. He demanded more wood alcohol to pitch in with, alleging that his granfather’s was all taxis and that it was only after ten o’connell, and this his isbar was a public oven for the sake of irsk irskusky, and then, not easily dis-couraged, opened the wrathfloods of his atillarery and went on at a wicked rate, weathering against him in mooxed metaphores from eleven thirty to two in the afternoon without even a lunch-eonette interval for House, son of Clod, to come out, you jew — beggar, to be Executed Amen.

Jim: Except pass that breathalyzer.

Ryan: You a big William Hung fan?
Todd Packer: Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?

Kevin's computer: [monkey noises]

Jim: I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
Pam: You are?

Pam: My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.

Pam: I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Jim: Oh yeah?
Pam: mmhmm.
Jim: Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Pam: Oh really?
Jim: Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?

Michael: Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. ""Old School"".
Toby: Michael?
Michael: Yes, Toby?
Toby: Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
Michael: Um... literally two seconds?

Michael: Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.

Toby: The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
Michael: No, no, Toby. No.
Toby: It's really not a big deal, Michael.
Michael: It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
Toby: And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
Michael: What?
Toby: Just to refresh you... .
Michael: NO!
Toby: on our policy.
Michael: What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Toby: Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Michael: There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.

Michael: Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.
Toby: Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
Michael: I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.

Michael: A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says ""Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?"" This is what's at stake.

Michael: Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
Darryl: Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Michael: Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
Darryl: Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Roy: Boys R Us!
Warehouse Guy: Oh!
Michael: Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
Darryl: Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Michael: Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
Roy: Hey, hey, hey.
Michael: What?
Roy: So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
Michael: I don't feel bad.
Darryl: [fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
Michael: No, I don't.
Roy: You look like you feel bad.
Michael: Okay.
Roy: Little package!
Michael: Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Warehouse guy: Little package! Little package!
Michael: Thank you.
Roy: You look good.
Darryl: Hiding from his momma.
Warehouse guys: [kissing noises, sheep baaing sounds]

Toby: So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
Pam: Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
Kevin: MILF!
Pam: Thanks, Kevin.

Pam: Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.

Pam: She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Toby: Great point.
Pam: Thank you.
Toby: Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
Michael: Hi, is it over?
Toby: Uh, yes!
Michael: No.
Toby: I can go over it with you.
Michael: I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Toby: It's over.
Michael: Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
Angela: Email forwards.
Michael: Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Angela: I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
Michael: Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
Stanley: That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Meredith: Um... what about office romance?
Toby: Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
Phyllis: All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
Michael: I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
Dwight: Yeah, Meredith.
Michael: No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: She would have definitely slept with me.
Kevin: She wasn't that hot.
Michael: Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
Toby: Ok, you know, Michael...

Jim: I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.

Michael: What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her ""partner"" in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?
Toby: No.
Michael: What if they made out? In front of everybody?
Toby: Well, that would be...
Michael: At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Toby: Okay, I'm lost.
Michael: Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?

Video: [Crossing the Line: Rules for the Modern Workplace]
Michael: I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
Jim: No, thanks. I'm good.
Michael: That's what she said. Pam?
Pam: Uh... my mother's coming.
Michael: That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.

Dwight: Hey, Toby.
Toby: Hey Dwight.
Dwight: You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Toby: Sure.
Dwight: Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?

Toby: Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.

Toby: Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
Dwight: Good. Good. And...
Toby: I should get back to work.
Dwight: Okay.

Man in Video: In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'
Video: [Scenario 1: The Natural Redhead]
Roy: Natural redhead.
Actor: Hey, Rach.
Redheaded Actress: Hey, Joe. Mike.
Actor: Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?
Darryl: Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Roy: That's her?
Darryl: Yes, this is the one.
Roy: No!
Darryl: You remember? Yes!
Roy: At the party?
Warehouse guy: You banged her?
Darryl: Yes! [to video screen] Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Michael: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.

Jan: [to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Michael: Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.

Todd Packer: Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
Pam: I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
Todd Packer: Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.

Michael: So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Mr. O'Malley: I love lawyer jokes.
Michael: Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.

Michael: When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.

Jan: You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
Michael: The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
Jan: Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Michael: Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
Jan: Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
Michael: No, I've seen the video.
Toby: [to Jan] He talked the whole time.
Michael: No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]

Michael: Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
Jim: Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Michael: Mmmhmm. Yes.
Jim: Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
Michael: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Jan: Michael. MICHAEL!
Michael: [laughing] Come on.
Jan: Michael, please.
Todd Packer: There he is.
Michael: Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office]
Todd Packer: There he is. Good one.

Michael: You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
Jan: Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
Michael: It's... That's...
Jan: That's not my sense of humor.
Michael: Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
Jan: Wha...
Michael: I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Albiny: [to camera] And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits.
Michael: This guy does it all.
Jan: [to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
Michael: What?
Jan: Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
Michael: So I'm not in trouble?

Michael: I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.

Michael: Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
Albiny: Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.
Michael: I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.

Pam's Mom: Um... hello.
Pam: [ecstatic] Oh my god!
Pam's Mom: Finally made it!
Pam: Hello!

Pam: I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.

Pam's Mom: This is all yours?
Pam: Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
Pam's Mom: Oh, my goodness. That's great.

Todd Packer: So a guy goes home, tells his wife, ""Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery."" She goes, ""Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?"" He goes, ""I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!"" [men laugh] Boom!

Pam: This is where I used to keep my computer.
Pam's Mom: Oh, right! I remember...
Pam: But then I moved it.
Pam's Mom: with the picture.
Pam: Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
Pam's Mom: Sure.
Pam: So this is like, um, an organization station...
Pam's Mom: [to Roy] Oooooh!
Pam: Hey!
Pam's Mom: Well, there he is!
Roy: How are ya?
Pam's Mom: Hi, handsome!
Roy: You look great!
Pam's Mom: Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?
Pam: Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
Pam's Mom: Oh, I don't believe that.
Roy: Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
Pam's Mom: Oh, anything is fine.
Roy: All right, I'll see ya.
Pam's Mom: So which one is Jim?
Pam: Mom!
Pam's Mom: I just wanted to know.
Pam: No.
Pam's Mom: All right. Okay.
Pam: Ten minutes.
Pam's Mom: Okay.
Pam: Then we can go to dinner.
Pam's Mom: I'll make myself busy.

Todd Packer: There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]
Kevin: Phyllis?
Michael: No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
Todd Packer: Ex-squeeze me?
Michael: Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
Kevin: Packer said it.
Michael: No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
Phyllis: I'm the same age as you, Michael.
Michael: I don't know about that.
Phyllis: We're in the same High School class.
Michael: Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Kevin: You mean where my desk is?
Michael: Yes, your corner. Go.
Kevin: Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Michael: Mmmhmmm.
Todd Packer: Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
Michael: They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.
Phyllis: Michael! Come on!
Michael: Oooh!
Phyllis: You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Michael: I'm not worried.
Phyllis: ...report you to HR.
Michael: You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.

Michael: Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.

Pam: He said what?"

Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level

That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, ‘87, the top peeled back

Jar Of HeartsChristina Perri,"[Verse 1]
I know I can't take one more step towards you
‘Cause all that's waiting is regret
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

[Pre-Chorus]
I've learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

[Verse 2]
I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
I've learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

[Verse 3]
Dear, it took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
‘Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Hold It Against MeBritney Spears,"[Verse 1]
Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I’m coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you’re winning
And they’re playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that I’m crazy
But you know I’m just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There’s a spark in-between us
When we’re dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I’m asking you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

And show me how you work it out
Alright

If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

If I said my heart was beating loud

I'm tryna hit the hotel with two girls that'll swallow me
Take this dick while I swallow Pink Moscato, got her freaky
Hey, you got me in a trance, please take off your pants
Pussy pop on a handstand, you got me sweating
Please pass me a fan, damn

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance
DJ, turn me up, ladies, this your jam (come on)
I'ma sip Moscato and you gon' lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (le'go)
Girl, drop it to the floor
I love the way your booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash (whoa, whoa, whoa, le'go)

[Verse 2: Wale]
She said, ""Look, ma, no hands""
She said, ""Look, ma, no hands"", and no, darling, I don't dance
And I'm with Roscoe, I'm with Waka, I think I deserve a chance
I'm a bad motherfucker, go and ask some motherfuckers
A young handsome motherfucker
I sling that wood, I just Nunchuck them
And who you with, and what's your name?
And you not hip, boo, I'm Wale
And that D.C. shit, I rep all day
And my eyes red cause of all that haze
Don't blow my high, let me shine
Drumma on the beat, let me take my time
Niggas want beef? We can take it outside
Fight for what broad? These hoes ain't mine
Is you out your mind? You out your league
I sweat no bitches, just sweat out weaves
Wear out tracks, let me do my thing
I got 16 for this Roscoe thing
But I'm almost done, let me get back to it
Whole lotta loud and a little Backwood
Whole lotta money, big tip, I would
I put her on the train, little engine could, bitch

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance
DJ, turn me up, ladies, this your jam (come on)
I'ma sip Moscato and you gon' lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (le'go)
Girl, drop it to the floor
I love the way your booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Roscoe Dash, okay
R-O-S-C-O-E, Mr. Shawty-Put-It-On-Me (please)
I be going HAM, shawty upgrade from baloney (please)
Them niggas tipping good, girl, but I can make it flood (I can)
Cause I walk around with pockets that are bigger than my bus
Rain, rain, go away, that's what all my haters say
My pockets stuck on overload, my rain never evaporates
No need to elaborate, most of these ducks exaggerate
But I'ma get money, nigga, everyday stunting, nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me (go)
Bitch, I'm balling like I'm coming off of free throws
Just ahead of the game, no cheat codes
Lambo, Roscoe, no street code
And your booty got me lost like Nemo
Go, go, go, go, gon' and do your dance
And I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands, go!

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance

How we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard

[Verse 2]
She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by

[Chorus]
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

[Verse 3]
She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
And we both know how
How we're going to make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by

[Chorus]
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

[Chorus]
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

[Bridge]
Yeah, for the first time
Oh, for the first time
Yeah, for the first time
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting for the first time

[Outro]
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby"
Written In The StarsTinie Tempah,"[Hook: Eric Turner]
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I’m on my way
(Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, you’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried tear drops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

[Hook: Eric Turner]
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I’m on my way

[Post Hook: Eric Turner & Tinie Tempah]
Oh, oh, oh, oh (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped
Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out

[Hook: Eric Turner]
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I’m on my way

Price TagJessie J,"[Intro: Jessie J]
Okay, Coconut Man, Moonhead and Pea
You ready?

[Verse 1: Jessie J]
Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that?
Yeah, we're paying with love tonight

Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

[Verse 2: Jessie J]
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes

Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well, keep the price tag and take the cash back
Just give me six strings and a half stack
And you can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And it's within' 30 seconds, I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never
Waiting to see this in the sign of defeat, uh-uh
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing

Yeah, yeah never ever ever ever ever

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say it, never never say it

When your heart's under attack (Oh no)
Gonna give everything I have

Here we go, Guess who?
J Smith and JB, uh huh
I gotcha lil bro, I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood, let's go
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Say never
I will never say never (Never say it, never never say it)
Say never
I will fight to forever to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never

Never say never, never say never, never say it
Never say never and never say never, never say it
Never say never, never say never, never say it

Never say never and never say never (Never say it)
Never say never and never say never

Sing it out, girl, you've got to be what tomorrow needs
For every time that they want to count you out
Use your voice every single time you open up your mouth

Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world

Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world

Sing it out, girl, before they kill what tomorrow brings
You've got to make a choice if the music drowns you out
And raise your voice every single time they try and shut your mouth

Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world

The Lazy SongBruno Mars,"[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
I'll be lounging on the couch
Just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, yes I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
She's gonna scream out, ""This is great!""
(Oh my god, this is great)
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, yes I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

[Bridge]
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone

Moment 4 LifeNicki Minaj,"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I fly with the stars, in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live, doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me, and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water, upon a vampire ('Pire)
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, - yes!
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, - yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ - me!
But I couldn't do it all alone - we!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we're done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just reminds me of
Everything they deprived me of (Kyuh!)
P-p-p-p-put ya drinks up!
It's a celebration, every time we link up
We done did everything, they can think of
Greatness, is what we on the brink of

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life
I could have this moment, I could have this moment
For life, for life
I could have this moment, I could have this moment
This is my moment, I just feel so alive
I could have this moment, I could have this moment
Alive, alive
I could have this moment, I could have this moment

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
What I tell 'em hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to ya knees
Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease
I'm in The Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout-out to the CEO, ""500 Degreez""
Shout-out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch the bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives, ah!

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life

For life, for life
I could have this moment, I could have this moment
This is my moment, I just feel so alive
I could have this moment, I could have this moment
Alive, alive
I could have this moment, I could have this moment

[Bridge: Nick Minaj]
This is my moment, I waited all my life
I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm one with the sunsets
I have become alive

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life
I could have this moment, I could have this moment

I Need A DoctorDr. Dre,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake! ‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!"" ‘cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life"

Rolling In The DeepAdele,"[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

I’m in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I’m in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

[Breakdown]
Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But something’s pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue and
Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby

[Verse 1]
Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?
Don't that shit there make you mad?
They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats
Then get busy on they ass
See, that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold
Don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go in and put your hands up
When times is hard you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up

One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back, that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys
I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti, then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy

[Chorus]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long

[Verse 3]
So, no matter what you been through
No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin' on

Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long

Just remember when you come up

Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up

Say goodbye and say hello
Sure enough good to see you, but it's time to go
Don't say yes but please don't say no
I don't want to be lonely tonight

Go away then, damn you, go on and do as you please yeah
You ain't gonna see me gettin' down on my knees
I'm undecided, and your heart's been divided
You've been turnin' my world upside down

Do me wrong, do me right right now, baby
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light, morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

I don't want to be lonely tonight, no, no
I don't want to be lonely tonight

I don't want to be lonely tonight"
Good LifeOneRepublic,"[Verse 1]
Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

[Verse 2]
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You got to take it in

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, a good, good life
Yeah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Hopelessly, I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly, I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly, I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly, the hope is we have
So much to feel good about

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Good, good life
Good life
Ooh, ooh
Oh
Listen, to my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about"

You can't even get in!
Hahaha

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée
I get what you get in 10 years in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari

Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said, ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say, ""On my dick""
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Haha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka

Okay
Okay
Is that right?
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka!"

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds

Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)Katy Perry,"[Verse 1]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled

The Story Of UsTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

[Outro]
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So, how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

So, how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Post-Chorus]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Verse 2]
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

[Pre-Bridge]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Bridge]
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls"

Never Gonna Leave This BedMaroon 5,"[Verse 1]
You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down, take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

So come here
And never leave this place

Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out?

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get

What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out

How To LoveLil Wayne,"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up
A little louder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love

How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out

Pretty GirlsIyaz,"[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
So many different flavors (Yup)
So many shapes and sizes (Wow)
You coming with me and you going with Iyaz
No surprises, I put it all on the table for you
Nothing is too taboo, I'm ready, willing and able for you (JR)

[Pre-Chorus: Iyaz]
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
I'm tryna find a shorty to hold me down

[Verse 2: Iyaz]
They say, to get a New York girl, then you gotta have a lot of class
And I heard ain't nothing like a Cali girl
But you better have a lot of cash
And I know, ain't nothing like them A-Town girl
'Cause they know how to show you love
And no matter where I go, I gotta let 'em know
That this song here is about you (Let's go)

[Pre-Chorus: Iyaz]
See, I don't mean to run away
To places you would not believe
I'm seeing all those pretty girls
I'm wishing you were there with me
It's simple when you smile, girl
Tells me all I need to know
You can be my one and only

[Chorus: Iyaz]
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city

Tell, tell, tell me, is it you, girl? (Hey)
Is it you, girl? (Hey)
Is it you, girl? (Hey)
Is it you, girl?

[Verse 3: Iyaz]
They say, to get a MIA girl, then you gotta have a lot of swag
And I heard, to get a Down South Bell
Then you gotta ride a Cadillac
And I know, ain't nothing like them London girl
'Cause they know how to party up
And no matter where I go, I gotta let 'em know
That this song here is about you

[Pre-Chorus: Iyaz]
See, I don't mean to run away

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city (In this city)
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town

I'm tryna find a shorty to hold me down
Tell, tell, tell me, is it you, girl? (Hey)

[Verse 4: Travie McCoy]
Oh, hehe
I'm so indecisive
Tryna find a pretty girl that these shoes goes nice with
Been around the world and back, got a nack for them girls in black
But I need a chick that's gonna hold me tight like vice grips (Uh-huh)
Just make sure you leave my heart how you found it (Yeah)
You can keep the key but the lock stays around it (Uh-huh)
Baby, let's take it slow, no pulling a fast one (No)
And you look like the type to keep my mind off the last one
(Let's go)

[Chorus: Iyaz]
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city

LightersBad Meets Evil,"[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I’m 6'8""

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
By the time you hear this, I’ll prob'ly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters"

Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me
It's too late, it's too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, ha!

You can't hack my digital, future aboriginal
Get up off my genitals, I stay on that pinnacle
Kill you with my lyricals, call me verbal criminal
Send you to that clinical, subscribe you some chemicals
Audio and visual, can't see me; invisible

Every Teardrop Is A WaterfallColdplay,"[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

[Outro]
Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
A wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall"

[Intro: Eva Simons]
I want you to take over control
Take, take
Take over control
Plug it in and turn me on

[Verse 1: Eva Simons]
Let's go take a ride in your car
I will take the passenger seat
Baby, we don't have to go far
Unless you wanna show
Me a lovely place out of town
Where you feel most at ease
Well, you are the one that I like
Always will be

[Pre-Chorus: Eva Simons]
I think it's time to let you know
The way I feel when you take hold
You set me free, my body's yours
It feels the best when you're involved

[Chorus: Eva Simons]
I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on
I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on

[Verse 2: Eva Simons]
Baby, baby, can't you see?
That I'm giving all of me
So, it's up to you now
We could let time pass away
I'll make an excuse to play
But, it's up to you now
Just wanna fulfill your needs
While you're taking over me
So, what do you want now?

Let's go take a ride in your car
I will take the passenger seat
Baby, we don't have to go far
Unless you wanna show
Me a lovely place out of town
Where you feel most at ease
Well, you are the one that I like
Always will be

[Pre-Chorus: Eva Simons]
I think it's time to let you know
The way I feel when you take hold
One single touch from you, I'm gone
Still get the rush when I'm alone
I think it is time I let you know
Take all of me, I will devote
You set me free, my body's yours
It feels the best when you're involved

I want you to take over control

Just wanna fulfill your needs
While you're taking over me

Keep Your Head UpAndy Grammer,"[Intro]

Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting on a sunset, bills on my mindset
I can't deny they're getting high
Higher than my income, income's bread crumbs
I've been trying to survive
The glow that the sun gets right around sunset
Helps me to realize
This is just a journey, drop your worries
You are gonna turn out fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you turn out fine
Fine, oh, you turn out fine

But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh
You gotta keep your head up, oh oh

To remember sometimes
But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh eh eh eh

[Verse 2]
I got my hands in my pockets, kicking these rocks
It's kinda hard to watch this life go by
I'm buying into skeptics
Skeptics mess with the confidence in my eyes
I'm seeing all the angles, thoughts get tangled
I start to compromise my life and my purpose
Is it all worth it?
Am I gonna turn out fine?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you turn out fine
Fine, oh, you turn out fine

[Chorus]
But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh

Only rainbows after rain
The sun will always come again
And it's a circle, circling
Around again, it comes around again, I say
Only rainbows after rain

Around again, it comes around

But you gotta keep your head up, oh oh
And you can let your hair down, eh eh
You gotta keep your head up, oh oh

NothingThe Script,"[Verse 1]
Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her
As they take me to my local down the street
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet

[Verse 2]
They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
But after one too many, I know that I'm never
Only they can't see where this is gonna end
They all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

[Chorus]
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind, turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

[Verse 3]
So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
I know if I faced her face, that she'll come to her senses
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
If she sees how much I'm hurting, she'll take me back for sure

[Chorus]
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind, turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

[Post-Chorus]
She said nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh, I got nothing
I got nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing

[Bridge]
Ohh, sometimes love's intoxicating
Ohh, you're coming down, your hands are shaking
When you realize there's no one waiting

[Interlude]
Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down

I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind, turn it all around

Till I'm GoneTinie Tempah,"[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, ""I’ll be back one day""
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone

I buy time in Switzerland, I drive round in Monaco
I shook hands with Royalty I make songs that monarchs know
Ti ti ti la so fa, mi mi mi mi re do
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I need that dollar yo
Hic-hic-hiccup, blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up now I’m balling like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of ""Nip Tuck""
And yes I am the best man, I’m so sorry 'bout the mix-up

[Pre-Chorus: Tinie Tempah]

The moment that we met, I didn't know it yet
That I was looking at a face I'll never forget
Cause I, I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind

Cause you are on my mind

What do you see when you close your eyes
Cause you are on my mind

Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me?

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am

I awaken and untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken, but I'm standing on my feet

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Drake]
I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (I said I’m on one)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like ""what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said ""I’m on one"", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said ""Fuck it, I’m on one""

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya ""everything is great""
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said ""I’m on one"", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said ""fuck it, I’m on one""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a maid nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB)

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said ""I’m on one"", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink

Dedication To My Ex (Miss That)Lloyd,"During nineteen fifty-nine, when the public was becoming aware of the Muslims after the New York telecast ""The Hate That Hate Produced,"" I was in San Francisco, about to retire after twenty years in the U.S. Coast Guard. A friend returned from a visit to her Detroit home and told me of a startling ""black man's"" religion, ""The Nation of Islam,"" to which, to her surprise, her entire family was converted. I listened with incredulity to how a ""mad scientist Mr. Yacub"" had genetically ""grafted"" the white race from an original black people. The organization's leader was described as ""The Honorable Elijah Muhammad"" and a ""Minister Malcolm X"" was apparently chief of staff.

When I entered a civilian writing career in New York City, I collected, around Harlem, a good deal of provocative material and then proposed an article about the cult to the Reader's Digest. Visiting the Muslim restaurant in Harlem, I asked how I could meet Minister Malcolm X, who was pointed out talking in a telephone booth right behind me. Soon he came out, a gangling, tall, reddish-brown-skinned fellow, at that time thirty-five years old; when my purpose was made known, he bristled, his eyes skewering me from behind the horn-rimmed glasses. ""You're another one of the white man's tools sent to spy!"" he accused me sharply. I said I had a legitimate writing assignment and showed him my letter from the magazine stating that an objective article was wanted, one that would balance what the Muslims said of themselves and what their attackers said about them. Malcolm X snorted that no white man's promise was worth the paper it was on; he would need time to decide if he would cooperate or not. Meanwhile, he suggested that I could attend some of the Harlem Temple Number 7 meetings (""temples"" have since been renamed ""mosques"") which were open to non-Muslim Negroes.

Around the Muslim's restaurant, I met some of the converts, all of them neatly dressed and almost embarrassingly polite. Their manners and miens reflected the Spartan personal discipline the organization demanded, and none of them would utter anything but Nation of Islam clichés. Even excellent weather was viewed as a blessing from Allah, with corollary credit due to ""The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.""

Finally, Minister Malcolm X told me that he would not take personal responsibility. He said that I should talk about an article with Mr. Muhammad personally. I expressed willingness, an appointment was made, and I flew to Chicago. The slightly built, shy-acting, soft-voiced Mr. Muhammad invited me to dinner with his immediate family in his mansion. I was aware that I was being carefully sized up while he talked primarily of F.B.I. and Internal Revenue Service close surveillance of his organization, and of a rumored forthcoming Congressional probe. ""But I have no fear of any of them; I have all that I need -- the truth,"" Mr. Muhammad said. The subject of my writing an article somehow never got raised, but Malcolm X proved far more cooperative when I returned.

He would sit with me at a white-topped table in the Muslim restaurant and answer guardedly any questions I asked between constant interruptions by calls from the New York press in the telephone booth. When I asked if I could see Muslim activities in some other cities, he arranged with other ministers for me to attend meetings at temples in Detroit, Washington, and Philadelphia.

My article entitled ""Mr. Muhammad Speaks"" appeared in early 1960, and it was the first featured magazine notice of the phenomenon. A letter quickly came from Mr. Muhammad appreciating that the article kept my promise to be objective, and Malcolm X telephoned similar compliments. About this time, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln's book The Black Muslims in America was published and the Black Muslims became a subject of growing interest. During 1961 and 1962, the Saturday Evening Post teamed me with a white writer, Al Balk, to do an article; next I did a personal interview of Malcolm X for Playboy magazine, which had promised to print verbatim whatever response he made to my questions. During that interview of several days' duration, Malcolm X repeatedly exclaimed, after particularly blistering anti-Christian or anti-white statements: ""You know that devil's not going to print that!"" He was very much taken aback when Playboy kept its word.

Malcolm X began to warm up to me somewhat. He was most aware of the national periodicals' power, and he had come to regard me, if still suspiciously, as one avenue of access. Occasionally now he began to telephone me advising me of some radio, television, or personal speaking appearance he was about to make, or he would invite me to attend some Black Muslim bazaar or other public affair.

I was in this stage of relationship with the Malcolm X who often described himself on the air as ""the angriest black man in America"" when in early 1963 my agent brought me together with a publisher whom the Playboy interview had given the idea of the autobiography of Malcolm X. I was asked if I felt I could get the now nationally known firebrand to consent to telling the intimate details of his entire life. I said I didn't know, but I would ask him. The editor asked me if I could sketch the likely highlights of such a book, and as I commenced talking, I realized how little I knew about the man personally, despite all my interviews. I said that the question had made me aware of how careful Malcolm X had always been to play himself down and to play up his leader Elijah Muhammad.

All that I knew, really, I said, was that I had heard Malcolm X refer in passing to his life of crime and prison before he became a Black Muslim; that several times he had told me: ""You wouldn't believe my past,"" and that I had heard others say that at one time he had peddled dope and women and committed armed robberies.

I knew that Malcolm X had an almost fanatical obsession about time. ""I have less patience with someone who doesn't wear a watch than with anyone else, for this type is not time-conscious,"" he had once told me. ""In all our deeds, the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure."" I knew how the Black Muslim membership was said to increase wherever Malcolm X lectured, and I knew his pride that Negro prisoners in most prisons were discovering the Muslim religion as he had when he was a convict. I knew he professed to eat only what a Black Muslim (preferably his wife Betty) had cooked and he drank innumerable cups of coffee which he lightened with cream, commenting wryly, ""Coffee is the only thing I like integrated."" Over our luncheon table, I told the editor and my agent how Malcolm X could unsettle non-Muslims -- as, for instance, once when he offered to drive me to a subway, I began to light a cigarette and he drily observed, ""That would make you the first person ever to smoke in this automobile.""

Malcolm X gave me a startled look when I asked him if he would tell his life story for publication. It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain. ""I will have to give a book a lot of thought,"" he finally said. Two days later, he telephoned me to meet him again at the Black Muslim restaurant. He said, ""I'll agree. I think my life story may help people to appreciate better how Mr. Muhammad salvages black people. But I don't want my motives for this misinterpreted by anybody -- the Nation of Islam must get every penny that might come to me."" Of course, Mr. Muhammad's agreement would be necessary, and I would have to ask Mr. Muhammad myself.

So I flew again to see Mr. Muhammad, but this time to Phoenix, Arizona, where the Nation of Islam had bought him the house in the hot, dry climate that relieved his severe bronchial condition. He and I talked alone this time. He told me how his organization had come far with largely uneducated Muslims and that truly giant strides for the black man could be made if his organization were aided by some of the talents which were available in the black race. He said, ""And one of our worst needs is writers"" -- but he did not press me to answer. He suddenly began coughing, and rapidly grew worse and worse until I rose from my seat and went to him, alarmed, but he waved me away, gasping that he would be all right. Between gasps, he told me he felt that ""Allah approves"" the book. He said, ""Malcolm is one of my most outstanding ministers."" After arranging for his chauffeur to return me to the Phoenix airport, Mr. Muhammad quickly bade me good-bye and rushed from the room coughing.

Back East, Malcolm X carefully read and then signed the publication contract, and he withdrew from his wallet a piece of paper filled with his sprawling longhand. ""This is this book's dedication,"" he said. I read: ""This book I dedicate to The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, who found me here in America in the muck and mire of the filthiest civilization and society on this earth, and pulled me out, cleaned me up, and stood me on my feet, and made me the man that I am today.""

The contract provided that all monies accruing to Malcolm X ""shall be made payable by the agent to `Muhammad's Mosque No. 2,'"" but Malcolm X felt this was insufficient. He dictated to me a letter to type for his signature, which I did: ""Any and all monies representing my contracted share of the financial returns should be made payable by the literary agent to Muhammad's Mosque No. 2. These payments should be mailed to the following address: Mr. Raymond Sharrieff, 4847 Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago 15, Illinois.""

Another letter was dictated, this one an agreement between him and me: ""Nothing can be in this book's manuscript that I didn't say, and nothing can be left out that I want in it.""

In turn, I asked Malcolm X to sign for me a personal pledge that however busy he was, he would give me a priority quota of his time for the planned 100,000-word ""as told to"" book which would detail his entire life. And months later, in a time of strain between us, I asked for -- and he gave -- his permission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review.

Malcolm X promptly did begin to pay me two- and three-hour visits, parking his blue Oldsmobile outside the working studio I then had in Greenwich Village. He always arrived around nine or ten at night carrying his flat tan leather briefcase which along with his scholarly look gave him a resemblance to a hardworking lawyer. Inevitably, he was tired after his long busy day, and sometimes he was clearly exhausted.

We got off to a very poor start. To use a word he liked, I think both of us were a bit ""spooky."" Sitting right there and staring at me was the fiery Malcolm X who could be as acid toward Negroes who angered him as he was against whites in general. On television, in press conferences, and at Muslim rallies, I had heard him bitterly attack other Negro writers as ""Uncle Toms,"" ""yard Negroes,"" ""black men in white clothes."" And there I sat staring at him, proposing to spend a year plumbing his innermost secrets when he had developed a near phobia for secrecy during his years of crime and his years in the Muslim hierarchy. My twenty years in military service and my Christian religious persuasion didn't help, either; he often jeered publicly at these affiliations for Negroes. And although he now would indirectly urge me to write for national magazines about the Muslims, he had told me several times, in various ways, that ""you blacks with professional abilities of any kind will one of these days wake up and find out that you must unite under the leadership of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad for your own salvation."" Malcolm X was also convinced that the F.B.I. had ""bugged"" my studio; he probably suspected that it may even have been done with my cooperation. For the first several weeks, he never entered the room where we worked without exclaiming, ""Testing, testing -- one, two, three. . . . ""

Tense incidents occurred. One night a white friend was in the studio when Malcolm X arrived a little earlier than anticipated, and they passed each other in the corridor. Malcolm X's manner during all of that session suggested that his worst doubts had been confirmed. Another time when Malcolm X sat haranguing me about the glories of the Muslim organization, he was gesturing with his passport in his hand; he saw that I was trying to read its perforated number and suddenly he thrust the passport toward me, his neck flushed reddish: ""Get the number straight, but it won't be anything the white devil doesn't already know. He issued me the passport.""

For perhaps a month I was afraid we weren't going to get any book. Malcolm X was still stiffly addressing me as ""Sir!"" and my notebook contained almost nothing but Black Muslim philosophy, praise of Mr. Muhammad, and the ""evils"" of ""the white devil."" He would bristle when I tried to urge him that the proposed book was his life. I was thinking that I might have to advise the publisher that I simply couldn't seem to get through to my subject when the first note of hope occurred. I had noticed that while Malcolm X was talking, he often simultaneously scribbled with his red-ink ball-point pen on any handy paper. Sometimes it was the margin of a newspaper he brought in, sometimes it was on index cards that he carried in the back of a small, redbacked appointment book. I began leaving two white paper napkins by him every time I served him more coffee, and the ruse worked when he sometimes scribbled on the napkins, which I retrieved when he left. Some examples are these:

""Here lies a YM, killed by a BM, fighting for the WM, who killed all the RM."" (Decoding that wasn't difficult knowing Malcolm X. ""YM"" was for yellow man, ""BM"" for black man, ""WM"" for white man, and ""RM"" was for red man.)

""Nothing ever happened without cause. Cause BM condition WM won't face. WM obsessed with hiding his guilt.""

""If Christianity had asserted itself in Germany, six million Jews would have lived.""

""WM so quick to tell BM `Look what I have done for you!' No! Look what you have done to us!""

""BM dealing with WM who put our eyes out, now he condemns us because we cannot see.""

""Only persons really changed history those who changed men's thinking about themselves. Hitler as well as Jesus, Stalin as well as Buddha . . . Hon. Elijah Muhammad. . . .""

It was through a clue from one of the scribblings that finally I cast a bait that Malcolm X took. ""Woman who cries all the time is only because she knows she can get away with it,"" he had scribbled. I somehow raised the subject of women. Suddenly, between sips of coffee and further scribbling and doodling, he vented his criticisms and skepticisms of women. ""You never can fully trust any woman,"" he said. ""I've got the only one I ever met whom I would trust seventy-five percent. I've told her that."" he said. ""I've told her like I tell you I've seen too many men destroyed by their wives, or their women.

""I don't completely trust anyone,"" he went on, ""not even myself. I have seen too many men destroy themselves. Other people I trust from not at all to highly, like The Honorable Elijah Muhammad."" Malcolm X looked squarely at me. ""You I trust about twenty-five percent.""

Trying to keep Malcolm X talking, I mined the woman theme for all it was worth. Triumphantly, he exclaimed, ""Do you know why Benedict Arnold turned traitor -- a woman!"" He said, ""Whatever else a woman is, I don't care who the woman is, it starts with her being vain. I'll prove it, something you can do anytime you want, and I know what I'm talking about, I've done it. You think of the hardest-looking, meanest-acting woman you know, one of those women who never smiles. Well, every day you see that woman you look her right in the eyes and tell her `I think you're beautiful,' and you watch what happens. The first day she may curse you out, the second day, too -- but you watch, you keep on, after a while one day she's going to start smiling just as soon as you come in sight.""

When Malcolm X left that night, I retrieved napkin scribblings that further documented how he could be talking about one thing and thinking of something else:

""Negroes have too much righteousness. WM says, `I want this piece of land, how do I get those couple of thousand BM on it off?'""

""I have wife who understands, or even if she doesn't she at least pretends.""

""BM struggle never gets open support from abroad it needs unless BM first forms own united front.""

""Sit down, talk with people with brains I respect, all of us want same thing, do some brainstorming.""

""Would be shocking to reveal names of the BM leaders who have secretly met with THEM."" (The capitalized letters stood for The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.)

Then one night, Malcolm X arrived nearly out on his feet from fatigue. For two hours, he paced the floor delivering a tirade against Negro leaders who were attacking Elijah Muhammad and himself. I don't know what gave me the inspiration to say once when he paused for breath, ""I wonder if you'd tell me something about your mother?""

Abruptly he quit pacing, and the look he shot at me made me sense that somehow the chance question had hit him. When I look back at it now, I believe I must have caught him so physically weak that his defenses were vulnerable.

Slowly, Malcolm X began to talk, now walking in a tight circle. ""She was always standing over the stove, trying to stretch whatever we had to eat. We stayed so hungry that we were dizzy. I remember the color of dresses she used to wear -- they were a kind of faded-out gray. . . ."" And he kept on talking until dawn, so tired that the big feet would often almost stumble in their pacing. From this stream-of-consciousness reminiscing I finally got out of him the foundation for this book's beginning chapters, ""Nightmare"" and ""Mascot."" After that night, he never again hesitated to tell me even the most intimate details of his personal life, over the next two years. His talking about his mother triggered something.

Malcolm X's mood ranged from somber to grim as he recalled his childhood. I remember his making a great point of how he learned what had been a cardinal awareness of his ever since: ""It's the hinge that squeaks that gets the grease."" When his narration reached his moving to Boston to live with his half-sister Ella, Malcolm X began to laugh about how ""square"" he had been in the ghetto streets. ""Why, I'm telling you things I haven't thought about since then!"" he would exclaim. Then it was during recalling the early Harlem days that Malcolm X really got carried away. One night, suddenly, wildly, he jumped up from his chair and, incredibly, the fearsome black demagogue was scat-singing and popping his fingers, ""re-bop-de-bop-blap-blam -- "" and then grabbing a vertical pipe with one hand (as the girl partner) he went jubilantly lindy-hopping around, his coattail and the long legs and the big feet flying as they had in those Harlem days. And then almost as suddenly, Malcolm X caught himself and sat back down, and for the rest of that session he was decidedly grumpy. Later on in the Harlem narrative, he grew somber again. ""The only thing I considered wrong was what I got caught doing wrong. I had a jungle mind, I was living in a jungle, and everything I did was done by instinct to survive."" But he stressed that he had no regrets about his crimes, ""because it was all a result of what happens to thousands upon thousands of black men in the white man's Christian world.""

His enjoyment resumed when the narrative entered his prison days. ""Let me tell you how I'd get those white devil convicts and the guards, too, to do anything I wanted. I'd whisper to them, `If you don't, I'll start a rumor that you're really a light Negro just passing as white.' That shows you what the white devil thinks about the black man. He'd rather die than be thought a Negro!"" He told me about the reading he had been able to do in prison: ""I didn't know what I was doing, but just by instinct I liked the books with intellectual vitamins."" And another time: ""In the hectic pace of the world today, there is no time for meditation, or for deep thought. A prisoner has time that he can put to good use. I'd put prison second to college as the best place for a man to go if he needs to do some thinking. If he's motivated, in prison he can change his life.""

Yet another time, Malcolm X reflected, ""Once a man has been to prison, he never looks at himself or at other people the same again. The `squares' out here whose boat has been in smooth waters all the time turn up their noses at an ex-con. But an ex-con can keep his head up when the `squares' sink.""

He scribbled that night (I kept both my notebooks and the paper napkins dated): ""This WM created and dropped A-bomb on non-whites; WM now calls `Red' and lives in fear of other WM he knows may bomb us.""

Also: ""Learn wisdom from the pupil of the eye that looks upon all things and yet to self is blind. Persian poet.""

At intervals, Malcolm X would make a great point of stressing to me, ""Now, I don't want anything in this book to make it sound that I think I'm somebody important."" I would assure him that I would try not to, and that in any event he would be checking the manuscript page by page, and ultimately the galley proofs. At other times, he would end an attack upon the white man and, watching me take the notes, exclaim. ""That devil's not going to print that, I don't care what he says!"" I would point out that the publishers had made a binding contract and had paid a sizable sum in advance. Malcolm X would say, ""You trust them, and I don't. You studied what he wanted you to learn about him in schools, I studied him in the streets and in prison, where you see the truth.""

Experiences which Malcolm X had had during a day could flavor his interview mood. The most wistful, tender anecdotes generally were told on days when some incident had touched him. Once, for instance, he told me that he had learned that a Harlem couple, not Black Muslims, had named their newborn son ""Malcolm"" after him. ""What do you know about that?"" he kept exclaiming. And that was the night he went back to his own boyhood again and this time recalled how he used to lie on his back on Hector's Hill and think. That night, too: ""I'll never forget the day they elected me the class president. A girl named Audrey Slaugh, whose father owned a car repair shop, nominated me. And a boy named James Cotton seconded the nomination. The teacher asked me to leave the room while the class voted. When I returned I was the class president. I couldn't believe it.""

Any interesting book which Malcolm X had read could get him going about his love of books. ""People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book."" He came back again and again to the books that he had studied when in prison. ""Did you ever read The Loom of Language?"" he asked me and I said I hadn't. ""You should. Philology, it's a tough science -- all about how words can be recognized, no matter where you find them. Now, you take `Caesar,' it's Latin, in Latin it's pronounced like `Kaiser,' with a hard C. But we anglicize it by pronouncing a soft C. The Russians say `Czar' and mean the same thing. Another Russian dialect says `Tsar.' Jakob Grimm was one of the foremost philologists, I studied his `Grimm's Law' in prison -- all about consonants. Philology is related to the science of etymology, dealing in root words. I dabbled in both of them.""

When I turn that page in my notebook, the next bears a note that Malcolm X had telephoned me saying ""I'm going to be out of town for a few days."" I assumed that as had frequently been the case before, he had speaking engagements or other Muslim business to attend somewhere and I was glad for the respite in which to get my notes separated under the chapter headings they would fit. But when Malcolm X returned this time, he reported triumphantly, ""I have something to tell you that will surprise you. Ever since we discussed my mother, I've been thinking about her. I realized that I had blocked her out of my mind -- it was just unpleasant to think about her having been twenty-some years in that mental hospital."" He said, ""I don't want to take the credit. It was really my sister Yvonne who thought it might be possible to get her out. Yvonne got my brothers Wilfred, Wesley and Philbert together, and I went out there, too. It was Philbert who really handled it.

""It made me face something about myself,"" Malcolm X said. ""My mind had closed about our mother. I simply didn't feel the problem could be solved, so I had shut it out. I had built up subconscious defenses. The white man does this. He shuts out of his mind, and he builds up subconscious defenses against anything he doesn't want to face up to. I've just become aware how closed my mind was now that I've opened it up again. That's one of the characteristics I don't like about myself. If I meet a problem I feel I can't solve, I shut it out. I make believe that it doesn't exist. But it exists.""

It was my turn to be deeply touched. Not long afterward, he was again away for a few days. When he returned this time, he said that at his brother Philbert's home, ""we had dinner with our mother for the first time in all those years!"" He said, ""She's sixty-six, and her memory is better than mine and she looks young and healthy. She has more of her teeth than those who were instrumental in sending her to the institution.""

When something had angered Malcolm X during the day, his face would be flushed redder when he visited me, and he generally would spend much of the session lashing out bitterly. When some Muslims were shot by Los Angeles policemen, one of them being killed, Malcolm X, upon his return from a trip he made there, was fairly apoplectic for a week. It had been in this mood that he had made, in Los Angeles, the statement which caused him to be heavily censured by members of both races.

""I've just heard some good news!"" -- referring to a plane crash at Orly Field in Paris in which thirty-odd white Americans, mostly from Atlanta, Georgia, had been killed instantly. (Malcolm X never publicly recanted this statement, to my knowledge, but much later he said to me simply, ""That's one of the things I wish I had never said."")

Anytime the name of the present Federal Judge Thurgood Marshall was raised, Malcolm X still practically spat fire in memory of what the judge had said years before when he was the N.A.A.C.P. chief attorney: ""The Muslims are run by a bunch of thugs organized from prisons and jails and financed, I am sure, by some Arab group."" The only time that I have ever heard Malcolm X use what might be construed as a curse word, it was a ""hell"" used in response to a statement that Dr. Martin Luther King made that Malcolm X's talk brought ""misery upon Negroes."" Malcolm X exploded to me, ""How in the hell can my talk do this? It's always a Negro responsible, not what the white man does!"" The ""extremist"" or ""demagogue"" accusation invariably would burn Malcolm X. ""Yes, I'm an extremist. The black race here in North America is in extremely bad condition. You show me a black man who isn't an extremist and I'll show you one who needs psychiatric attention!""

Once when he said, ""Aristotle shocked people. Charles Darwin outraged people. Aldous Huxley scandalized millions!"" Malcolm X immediately followed the statement with ""Don't print that, people would think I'm trying to link myself with them."" Another time, when something provoked him to exclaim, ""These Uncle Toms make me think about how the Prophet Jesus was criticized in his own country!"" Malcolm X promptly got up and silently took my notebook, tore out that page and crumpled it and put it into his pocket, and he was considerably subdued during the remainder of that session.

I remember one time we talked and he showed me a newspaper clipping reporting where a Negro baby had been bitten by a rat. Malcolm X said, ""Now, just read that, just think of that a minute! Suppose it was your child! Where's that slumlord -- on some beach in Miami!"" He continued fuming throughout our interview. I did not go with him when later that day he addressed a Negro audience in Harlem and an incident occurred which Helen Dudar reported in the New York Post.

""Malcolm speaking in Harlem stared down at one of the white reporters present, the only whites admitted to the meeting, and went on, `Now, there's a reporter who hasn't taken a note in half an hour, but as soon as I start talking about the Jews, he's busy taking notes to prove that I'm anti-Semitic.'

Behind the reporter, a male voice spoke up, `Kill the bastard, kill them all.' The young man, in his unease, smiled nervously and Malcolm jeered, `Look at him laugh. He's really not laughing, he's just laughing with his teeth.' An ugly tension curled the edges of the atmosphere. Then Malcolm went on: `The white man doesn't know how to laugh. He just shows his teeth. But we know how to laugh. We laugh deep down, from the bottom up.' The audience laughed, deep down, from the bottom up and, as suddenly as Malcolm had stirred it, so, skillfully and swiftly, he deflected it. It had been at once a masterful and shabby performance.""

I later heard somewhere, or read, that Malcolm X telephoned an apology to the reporter. But this was the kind of evidence which caused many close observers of the Malcolm X phenomenon to declare in absolute seriousness that he was the only Negro in America who could either start a race riot -- or stop one. When I once quoted this to him, tacitly inviting his comment, he told me tartly, ""I don't know if I could start one. I don't know if I'd want to stop one."" It was the kind of statement he relished making.

Over the months, I had gradually come to establish something of a telephone acquaintance with Malcolm X's wife, whom I addressed as ""Sister Betty,"" as I had heard the Muslims do. I admired how she ran a home, with, then, three small daughters, and still managed to take all of the calls which came for Malcolm X, surely as many calls as would provide a job for an average switchboard operator. Sometimes when he was with me, he would telephone home and spend as much as five minutes rapidly jotting on a pad the various messages which had been left for him.

Sister Betty, generally friendly enough on the phone with me, sometimes would exclaim in spontaneous indignation, ""The man never gets any sleep!"" Malcolm X rarely put in less than an eighteen-hour workday. Often when he had left my studio at four A.M. and a forty-minute drive lay between him and home in East Elmhurst, Long Island, he had asked me to telephone him there at nine A.M. Usually this would be when he wanted me to accompany him somewhere, and he was going to tell me, after reviewing his commitments, when and where he wanted me to meet him. (There were times when I didn't get an awful lot of sleep, myself.) He was always accompanied, either by some of his Muslim colleagues like James 67X (the 67th man named ""James"" who had joined Harlem's Mosque Number 7), or Charles 37X, or by me, but he never asked me to be with him when they were. I went with him to college and university lectures, to radio and television stations for his broadcasts, and to public appearances in a variety of situations and locations.

If we were driving somewhere, motorists along the highway would wave to Malcolm X, the faces of both whites and Negroes spontaneously aglow with the wonderment that I had seen evoked by other ""celebrities."" No few airline hostesses had come to know him, because he flew so much; they smiled prettily at him, he was in turn the essence of courtly gentlemanliness, and inevitably the word spread and soon an unusual flow of bathroom traffic would develop, passing where he sat. Whenever we arrived at our destination, it became familiar to hear ""There's Malcolm X!"" ""Where?"" ""The tall one."" Passers-by of both races stared at him. A few of both races, more Negroes than whites, would speak or nod to him in greeting. A high percentage of white people were visibly uncomfortable in his presence, especially within the confines of small areas, such as in elevators. ""I'm the only black man they've ever been close to who they know speaks the truth to them,"" Malcolm X once explained to me. ""It's their guilt that upsets them, not me."" He said another time, ""The white man is afraid of truth. The truth takes the white man's breath and drains his strength -- you just watch his face get red anytime you tell him a little truth.""

There was something about this man when he was in a room with people. He commanded the room, whoever else was present. Even out of doors; once I remember in Harlem he sat on a speaker's stand between Congressman Adam Clayton Powell and the former Manhattan Borough President Hulan Jack, and when the street rally was over the crowd focus was chiefly on Malcolm X. I remember another time that we had gone by railway from New York City to Philadelphia where he appeared in the Philadelphia Convention Hall on the radio station WCAU program of Ed Harvey. ""You are the man who has said `All Negroes are angry and I am the angriest of all'; is that correct?"" asked Harvey, on the air, introducing Malcolm X, and as Malcolm X said crisply, ""That quote is correct!"" the gathering crowd of bystanders stared at him, riveted.

We had ridden to Philadelphia in reserved parlor car seats. ""I can't get caught on a coach, I could get into trouble on a coach,"" Malcolm X had said. Walking to board the parlor car, we had passed a dining car toward which he jerked his head, ""I used to work on that thing."" Riding to our destination, he conversationally told me that the F.B.I. had tried to bribe him for information about Elijah Muhammad; that he wanted me to be sure and read a new book, Crisis in Black and White by Charles Silberman -- ""one of the very few white writers I know with the courage to tell his kind the truth""; and he asked me to make a note to please telephone the New York Post's feature writer Helen Dudar and tell her he thought very highly of her recent series -- he did not want to commend her directly.

After the Ed Harvey Show was concluded, we took the train to return to New York City. The parlor car, packed with businessmen behind their newspapers, commuting homeward after their workdays, was electric with Malcolm X's presence. After the white-jacketed Negro porter had made several trips up and down the aisle, he was in the middle of another trip when Malcolm X sotto-voced in my ear, ""He used to work with me, I forget his name, we worked right on this very train together. He knows it's me. He's trying to make up his mind what to do."" The porter went on past us, poker-faced. But when he came through again, Malcolm X suddenly leaned forward from his seat, smiling at the porter. ""Why, sure, I know who you are!"" the porter suddenly said, loudly. ""You washed dishes right on this train! I was just telling some of the fellows you were in my car here. We all follow you!""

The tension on the car could have been cut with a knife. Then, soon, the porter returned to Malcolm X, his voice expansive. ""One of our guests would like to meet you."" Now a young, cleancut white man rose and came up, his hand extended, and Malcolm X rose and shook the proffered hand firmly. Newspapers dropped just below eye-level the length of the car. The young white man explained distinctly, loudly, that he had been in the Orient for a while, and now was studying at Columbia. ""I don't agree with everything you say,"" he told Malcolm X, ""but I have to admire your presentation.""

Malcolm's voice in reply was cordiality itself. ""I don't think you could search America, sir, and find two men who agree on everything."" Subsequently, to another white man, an older businessman, who came up and shook hands, he said evenly, ""Sir, I know how you feel. It's a hard thing to speak out against me when you are agreeing with so much that I say."" And we rode on into New York under, now, a general open gazing.

In Washington, D.C., Malcolm X slashed at the government's reluctance to take positive steps in the Negro's behalf. I gather that even the White House took notice, for not long afterward I left off interviewing Malcolm X for a few days and went to the White House to do a Playboy interview of the then White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger, who grimaced spontaneously when I said I was writing the life story of Malcolm X. Another time I left Malcolm X to interview the U.S. Nazi Party Commander George Lincoln Rockwell, who frankly stated that he admired the courage of Malcolm X, and he felt that the two of them should speak together across the United States, and they could thus begin a real solution to the race problem -- one of voluntary separation of the white and black races, with Negroes returning to Africa. I reported this to Malcolm X, who snorted, ""He must think I'm nuts! What am I going to look like going speaking with a devil!"" Yet another time, I went off to Atlanta and interviewed for Playboy Dr. Martin Luther King. He was privately intrigued to hear little-known things about Malcolm X that I told him; for publication, he discussed him with reserve, and he did say that he would sometime like to have an opportunity to talk with him. Hearing this, Malcolm X said drily, ""You think I ought to send him a telegram with my telephone number?"" (But from other things that Malcolm X said to me at various times, I deduced that he actually had a reluctant admiration for Dr. King.)

Malcolm X and I reached the point, ultimately, where we shared a mutual camaraderie that, although it was never verbally expressed, was a warm one. He was for me unquestionably one of the most engaging personalities I had ever met, and for his part, I gathered, I was someone he had learned he could express himself to, with candor, without the likelihood of hearing it repeated, and like any person who lived amid tension, he enjoyed being around someone, another man, with whom he could psychically relax. When I made trips now, he always asked me to telephone him when I would be returning to New York, and generally, if he could squeeze it into his schedule, he met me at the airport. I would see him coming along with his long, gangling strides, and wearing the wide, toothy, good-natured grin, and as he drove me into New York City he would bring me up to date on things of interest that had happened since I left. I remember one incident within the airport that showed me how Malcolm X never lost his racial perspective. Waiting for my baggage, we witnessed a touching family reunion scene as part of which several cherubic little children romped and played, exclaiming in another language. ""By tomorrow night, they'll know how to say their first English word -- nigger,"" observed Malcolm X.

When Malcolm X made long trips, such as to San Francisco or Los Angeles, I did not go along, but frequently, usually very late at night, he would telephone me, and ask how the book was coming along, and he might set up the time for our next interview upon his return. One call that I never will forget came at close to four A.M., waking me; he must have just gotten up in Los Angeles. His voice said, ""Alex Haley?"" I said, sleepily, ""Yes? Oh, hey, Malcolm!"" His voice said, ""I trust you seventy percent"" -- and then he hung up. I lay a short time thinking about him and I went back to sleep feeling warmed by that call, as I still am warmed to remember it. Neither of us ever mentioned it.

Malcolm X's growing respect for individual whites seemed to be reserved for those who ignored on a personal basis the things he said about whites and who jousted with him as a man. He, moreover, was convinced that he could tell a lot about any person by listening. ""There's an art to listening well,"" he told me. ""I listen closely to the sound of a man's voice when he's speaking. I can hear sincerity."" The newspaper person whom he ultimately came to admire probably more than any other was the New York Times' M. S. Handler. (I was very happy when I learned that Handler had agreed to write this book's Introduction; I know that Malcolm X would have liked that.) The first time I ever heard Malcolm X speak of Handler, whom he had recently met, he began, ""I was talking with this devil --"" and abruptly he cut himself off in obvious embarrassment. ""It's a reporter named Handler, from the Times --"" he resumed. Malcolm X's respect for the man steadily increased, and Handler, for his part, was an influence upon the inner Malcolm X. ""He's the most genuinely unprejudiced white man I ever met,"" Malcolm X said to me, speaking of Handler months later. ""I have asked him things and tested him. I have listened to him talk, closely.""

I saw Malcolm X too many times exhilarated in after-lecture give-and-take with predominantly white student bodies at colleges and universities to ever believe that he nurtured at his core any blanket white-hatred. ""The young whites, and blacks, too, are the only hope that America has,"" he said to me once. ""The rest of us have always been living in a lie.""

Several Negroes come to mind now who I know, in one way or another, had vastly impressed Malcolm X. (Some others come to mind whom I know he has vastly abhorred, but these I will not mention.) Particularly high in his esteem, I know, was the great photographer, usually associated with Life magazine, Gordon Parks. It was Malcolm X's direct influence with Elijah Muhammad which got Parks permitted to enter and photograph for publication in Life the highly secret self-defense training program of the Black Muslim Fruit of Islam, making Parks, as
far as I know, the only non-Muslim who ever has witnessed this, except for policemen and other agency representatives who had feigned ""joining"" the Black Muslims to infiltrate them. ""His success among the white man never has made him lose touch with black reality,"" Malcolm X said of Parks once.

Another person toward whom Malcolm X felt similarly was the actor Ossie Davis. Once in the middle of one of our interviews, when we had been talking about something else, Malcolm X suddenly asked me, ""Do you know Ossie Davis?"" I said I didn't. He said, ""I ought to introduce you sometime, that's one of the finest black men."" In Malcolm X's long dealings with the staff of the Harlem weekly newspaper Amsterdam News, he had come to admire Executive Editor James Hicks and the star feature writer James Booker. He said that Hicks had ""an open mind, and he never panics for the white man."" He thought that Booker was an outstanding reporter; he also was highly impressed with Mrs. Booker when he met her.

It was he who introduced me to two of my friends today, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln who was at the time writing the book The Black Muslims in America, and Louis Lomax who was then writing various articles about the Muslims. Malcolm X deeply respected the care and depth which Dr. Lincoln was putting into his research. Lomax, he admired for his ferreting ear and eye for hot news. ""If I see that rascal Lomax running somewhere, I'll grab my hat and get behind him,"" Malcolm X said once, ""because I know he's onto something."" Author James Baldwin Malcolm X also admired. ""He's so brilliant he confuses the white man with words on paper."" And another time, ""He's upset the white man more than anybody except The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.""

Malcolm X had very little good to say of Negro ministers, very possibly because most of them had attacked the Black Muslims. Excepting reluctant admiration of Dr. Martin Luther King, I heard him speak well of only one other, The Reverend Eugene L. Callender of Harlem's large Presbyterian Church of the Master. ""He's a preacher, but he's a fighter for the black man,"" said Malcolm X. I later learned that somewhere the direct, forthright Reverend Callender had privately cornered Malcolm X and had read him the riot act about his general attacks upon the Negro
clergy. Malcolm X also admired The Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, in his Congressman political role: ""I'd think about retiring if the black man had ten like him in Washington."" He had similar feelings about the N.A.A.C.P. lawyer, now a New York State Assemblyman, Percy Sutton, and later Sutton was retained as his personal attorney. Among Negro educators, of whom Malcolm X met many in his college and university lecturing, I never heard him speak well of any but one, Dr. Kenneth B. Clark. ""There's a black man with brains gone to bed,"" Malcolm X told me once, briefly lapsing into his old vernacular. He had very distinct reservations about Negro professional intelligentsia as a category. They were the source from which most of the Black Muslims' attackers came. It was for this reason that some of his most bristling counterattacks against ""these so-called educated Uncle Thomases, Ph.D."" were flung out at his audiences at Negro institutions of higher learning.

Where I witnessed the Malcolm X who was happiest and most at ease among members of our own race was when sometimes I chanced to accompany him on what he liked to call ""my little daily rounds"" around the streets of Harlem, among the Negroes that he said the ""so-called black leaders"" spoke of ""as black masses statistics."" On these tours, Malcolm X generally avoided the arterial 125th Street in Harlem; he plied the side streets, especially in those areas which were thickest with what he described as ""the black man down in the gutter where I came from,"" the poverty-ridden with a high incidence of dope addicts and winos.

Malcolm X here indeed was a hero. Striding along the side-walks, he bathed all whom he met in the boyish grin, and his conversation with any who came up was quiet and pleasant. ""It's just what the white devil wants you to do, brother,"" he might tell a wino, ""he wants you to get drunk so he will have an excuse to put a club up beside your head."" Or I remember once he halted at a stoop to greet several older women: ""Sisters, let me ask you something,"" he said conversationally, ""have you ever known one white man who either didn't do something to you, or take something from you?"" One among that audience exclaimed after a moment, ""I sure ain't!"" whereupon all of them
joined in laughter and we walked on with Malcolm X waving back to cries of ""He's right!""

I remember that once in the early evening we rounded a corner to hear a man, shabbily dressed, haranguing a small crowd around his speaking platform of an upturned oblong wooden box with an American flag alongside. ""I don't respect or believe in this damn flag, it's there because I can't hold a public meeting without it unless I want the white man to put me in jail. And that's what I'm up here to talk about -- these crackers getting rich off the blood and bones of your and my people!"" Said Malcolm X, grinning, ""He's working!""

Malcolm X rarely exchanged any words with those Negro men with shiny, ""processed"" hair without giving them a nudge. Very genially: ""Ahhhh, brother, the white devil has taught you to hate yourself so much that you put hot lye in your hair to make it look more like his hair.""

I remember another stoopful of women alongside the door of a small grocery store where I had gone for something, leaving Malcolm X talking across the street. As I came out of the store, one woman was excitedly describing for the rest a Malcolm X lecture she had heard in Mosque Number 7 one Sunday. ""Oooooh, he burnt that white man, burnt him up, chile . . . chile, he told us we descendin' from black kings an' queens -- Lawd, I didn't know it!"" Another woman asked, ""You believe that?"" and the first vehemently responded, ""Yes, I do!""

And I remember a lone, almost ragged guitarist huddled on a side street playing and singing just for himself when he glanced up and instantly recognized the oncoming, striding figure. ""Huh-ho!"" the guitarist exclaimed, and jumping up, he snapped into a mock salute. ""My man!""

Malcolm X loved it. And they loved him. There was no question about it: whether he was standing tall beside a street lamp chatting with winos, or whether he was firing his radio and television broadsides to unseen millions of people, or whether he was titillating small audiences of sophisticated whites with his small-talk such as, ""My hobby is stirring up Negroes, that's spelled knee-grows the way you liberals pronounce it"" -- the man had charisma, and he had power. And I was not the only one who at various times marveled at how he could continue to receive such an awesome amount of international personal publicity and still season liberally practically everything he said, both in public and privately, with credit and hosannas to ""The Honorable Elijah Muhammad."" Often I made side notes to myself about this. I kept, in effect, a double-entry set of notebooks. Once, noting me switching from one to the other, Malcolm X curiously asked me what for? I told him some reason, but not that one notebook was things he said for his book and the other was for my various personal observations about him; very likely he would have become self-conscious. ""You must have written a million words by now,"" said Malcolm X. ""Probably,"" I said. ""This white man's crazy,"" he mused. ""I'll prove it to you. Do you think I'd publicize somebody knocking me like I do him?""

""Look, tell me the truth,"" Malcolm X said to me one evening, ""you travel around. Have you heard anything?""

Truthfully, I told him I didn't know what he had reference to. He dropped it and talked of something else.

From Malcolm X himself, I had seen, or heard, a few unusual things which had caused me some little private wonder and speculation, and then, with nothing to hang them on to, I had dismissed them. One day in his car, we had stopped for the red light at an intersection; another car with a white man driving had stopped alongside, and when this white man saw Malcolm X, he instantly called across to him, ""I don't blame your people for turning to you. If I were a Negro I'd follow you, too. Keep up the fight!"" Malcolm X said to the man very sincerely, ""I wish I could have a white chapter of the people I meet like you."" The light changed, and as both cars drove on, Malcolm X quickly said to me, firmly, ""Not only don't write that, never repeat it. Mr. Muhammad would have a fit."" The significant thing about the incident, I later reflected, was that it was the first time I had ever heard him speak of Elijah Muhammad with anything less than reverence.

About the same time, one of the scribblings of Malcolm X's that I had retrieved had read, enigmatically, ""My life has always been one of changes."" Another time, this was in September, 1963, Malcolm X had been highly upset about something during an entire session, and when I read the Amsterdam News for that week, I guessed that he had been upset about an item in Jimmy Booker's column that Booker had heard that Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X were feuding. (Booker was later to reveal that after his column was written, he had gone on vacation, and on his return he learned that Malcolm X ""stormed into the Amsterdam News with three followers . . . `I want to see Jimmy Booker. I don't like what he wrote. There is no fight between me and Elijah Muhammad. I believe in Mr. Muhammad and will lay down my life for him.'"")

Also, now and then, when I chanced to meet a few other key Muslims, mainly when I was with Malcolm X, but when he was not immediately present, I thought I detected either in subtle phrasing, or in manner, something less than total admiration of their famous colleague -- and then I would tell myself I had misinterpreted. And during these days, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln and I would talk on the phone fairly often. We rarely would fail to mention how it seemed almost certain that seeds of trouble lay in the fact that however much Malcolm X praised Elijah Muhammad, it was upon dramatic, articulate Malcolm X that the communications media and hence the general public focused the great bulk of their attention. I never dreamed, though, what Malcolm X was actually going through. He never breathed a word, at least not to me, until the actual rift became public.

When Malcolm X left me at around two A.M. on that occasion, he asked me to call him at nine A.M. The telephone in the home in East Elmhurst rang considerably longer than usual, and Sister Betty, when she answered, sounded strained, choked up. When Malcolm X came on, he, too, sounded different. He asked me, ""Have you heard the radio or seen the newspapers?"" I said I hadn't. He said, ""Well, do!"" and that he would call me later.

I went and got the papers. I read with astonishment that Malcolm X had been suspended by Elijah Muhammad -- the stated reason being the ""chickens coming home to roost"" remark that Malcolm X recently had made as a comment upon the assassination of President Kennedy.

Malcolm X did telephone, after about an hour, and I met him at the Black Muslims' newspaper office in Harlem, a couple of blocks further up Lenox Avenue from their mosque and restaurant. He was seated behind his light brown metal desk and his brown hat lay before him on the green blotter. He wore a dark suit with a vest, a white shirt, the inevitable leaping-sailfish clip held his narrow tie, and the big feet in the shined black shoes pushed the swivel chair pendulously back and forth as he talked into the telephone.

""I'm always hurt over any act of disobedience on my part concerning Mr. Muhammad. . . . Yes, sir -- anything The Honorable Elijah Muhammad does is all right with me. I believe absolutely in his wisdom and authority."" The telephone would ring again instantly every time he put it down. ""Mr. Peter Goldman! I haven't heard your voice in a good while! Well, sir, I just should have kept my big mouth shut."" To the New York Times: ""Sir? Yes -- he suspended me from making public appearances for the time being, which I fully understand. I say the same thing to you that I have told others, I'm in complete submission to Mr. Muhammad's judgment, because I have always found his judgment to be based on sound thinking."" To C.B.S.: ""I think that anybody who is in a position to discipline others should first learn to accept discipline himself.""

He brought it off, the image of contriteness, the best he could -- throughout the harshly trying next several weeks. But the back of his neck was reddish every time I saw him. He did not yet put into words his obvious fury at the public humiliation. We did very little interviewing now, he was so busy on telephones elsewhere; but it did not matter too much because by now I had the bulk of the needed life story material in hand. When he did find some time to visit me, he was very preoccupied, and I could feel him rankling with anger and with inactivity, but he tried hard to hide it.

He scribbled one night, ""You have not converted a man because you have silenced him. John Viscount Morley."" And the same night, almost illegibly, ""I was going downhill until he picked me up, but the more I think of it, we picked each other up.""

When I did not see him for several days, a letter came. ""I have cancelled all public appearances and speaking engagements for a number of weeks. So within that period it should be possible to finish this book. With the fast pace of newly developing incidents today, it is easy for something that is done or said tomorrow to be outdated even by sunset on the same day. Malcolm X.""

I pressed to get the first chapter, ""Nightmare,"" into a shape that he could review. When it was ready in a readable rough draft, I telephoned him. He came as quickly as he could drive from his home -- which made me see how grinding an ordeal it was to him to just be sitting at home, inactive, and knowing his temperament, my sympathies went out to Sister Betty.

He pored over the manuscript pages, raptly the first time, then drawing out his red-ink ball-point pen he read through the chapter again, with the pen occasionally stabbing at something. ""You can't bless Allah!"" he exclaimed, changing ""bless"" to ""praise."" In a place that referred to himself and his brothers and sisters, he scratched red through ""we kids."" ""Kids are goats!"" he exclaimed sharply.

Soon, Malcolm X and his family flew to Miami. Cassius Clay had extended the invitation as a sixth wedding anniversary present to Malcolm X and Sister Betty, and they had accepted most gratefully. It was Sister Betty's first vacation in the six years of the taut regimen as a Black Muslim wife, and it was for Malcolm X both a saving of face and something to do.

Very soon after his arrival, he telegraphed me his phone number at a motel. I called him and he told me, ""I just want to tell you something. I'm not a betting man anymore, but if you are, you bet on Cassius to beat Liston, and you will win."" I laughed and said he was prejudiced. He said, ""Remember what I told you when the fight's over."" I received later a picture postcard, the picture in vivid colors being of a chimpanzee at the Monkey Jungle in Miami. Malcolm X had written on the reverse side, ""One hundred years after the Civil War, and these chimpanzees get more recognition, respect and freedom in America than our people do. Bro. Malcolm X."" Another time, an envelope came, and inside it was a clipping of an Irv Kupcinet column in the Chicago Sun-Times. Malcolm X's red pen had encircled an item which read, ""Insiders are predicting a split in the Black Muslims. Malcolm X, ousted as No. 2 man in the organization, may form a splinter group to oppose Elijah Muhammad."" Alongside the item, Malcolm X had scribbled ""Imagine this!!!""

The night of the phenomenal upset, when Clay did beat Liston, Malcolm X telephoned me, and sounds of excitement were in the background. The victory party was in his motel suite, Malcolm X told me. He described what was happening, mentioned some of those who were present, and that the new heavyweight king was ""in the next room, my bedroom here"" taking a nap. After reminding me of the fight prediction he had made, Malcolm X said that I should look forward now to Clay's ""quick development into a major world figure. I don't know if you really realize the world significance that this is the first Muslim champion.""

It was the following morning when Cassius Clay gave the press interview which resulted in national headlines that he was actually a ""Black Muslim,"" and soon after, the newspapers were carrying pictures of Malcolm X introducing the heavyweight champion to various African diplomats in the lobbies of the United Nations headquarters in New York City. Malcolm X toured Clay about in Harlem, and in other places, functioning, he said, as Clay's ""friend and religious advisor.""

I had now moved upstate to finish my work on the book, and we talked on the telephone every three or four days. He said things suggesting that he might never be returned to his former Black Muslim post, and he now began to say things quietly critical of Elijah Muhammad. Playboy magazine asked me to do an interview for them with the new champion Cassius Clay, and when I confidently asked Malcolm X to arrange for me the needed introduction to Clay, Malcolm X hesitantly said, ""I think you had better ask somebody else to do that."" I was highly surprised at the reply, but I had learned never to press him for information. And then, very soon after, I received a letter. ""Dear Alex Haley: A quick note. Would you prepare a properly worded letter that would enable me to change the reading of the contract so that all remaining proceeds now would go to the Muslim Mosque, Inc., or in the case of my death then to go directly to my wife, Mrs. Betty X Little? The sooner this letter or contract is changed, the more easily I will rest."" Under the signature of Malcolm X, there was a P.S.: ""How is it possible to write one's autobiography in a world so fast-changing as this?""

Soon I read in the various newspapers that rumors were being heard of threats on Malcolm X's life. Then there was an article in the Amsterdam News: The caption was ""Malcolm X Tells Of Death Threat,"" and the story reported that he had said that former close associates of his in the New York mosque had sent out ""a special squad"" to ""try to kill me in cold blood. Thanks to Allah, I learned of the plot from the very same brothers who had been sent out to murder me. These brothers had heard me represent and defend Mr. Muhammad for too long for them to swallow the lies about me without first asking me some questions for their own clarification.""

I telephoned Malcolm X, and expressed my personal concern for him. His voice sounded weary. He said that his ""uppermost interest"" was that any money which might come due him in the future would go directly to his new organization, or to his wife, as the letter he had signed and mailed had specified. He told me, ""I know I've got to get a will made for myself, I never did because I never have had anything to will to anybody, but if I don't have one and something happened to me, there could be a mess."" I expressed concern for him, and he told me that he had a loaded rifle in his home, and ""I can take care of myself.""

The ""Muslim Mosque, Inc."" to which Malcolm X had referred was a new organization which he had formed, which at that time consisted of perhaps forty or fifty Muslims who had left the leadership of Elijah Muhammad.

Through a close associate of Cassius Clay, whom Malcolm X had finally suggested to me, my interview appointment was arranged with the heavyweight champion, and I flew down to New York City to do the interview for Playboy. Malcolm X was ""away briefly,"" Sister Betty said on the phone -- and she spoke brusquely. I talked with one Black Muslim lady whom I had known before she had joined, and who had been an admirer of Malcolm X. She had elected to remain in the original fold, ""but I'll tell you, brother, what a lot in the mosque are saying, you know, it's like if you divorced your husband, you'd still like to see him once in a while."" During my interviews with Cassius Clay in his three-room suite at Harlem's Theresa Hotel, inevitably the questions got around to Clay's Muslim membership, then to a query about what had happened to his formerly very close relationship with Malcolm X. Evenly, Clay said, ""You just don't buck Mr. Muhammad and get away with it. I don't want to talk about him no more.""

Elijah Muhammad at his headquarters in Chicago grew ""emotionally affected"" whenever the name of Malcolm X had to be raised in his presence, one of the Muslims in Clay's entourage told me. Mr. Muhammad reportedly had said, ""Brother Malcolm got to be a big man. I made him big. I was about to make him a great man."" The faithful Black Muslims predicted that soon Malcolm X would be turned upon by the defectors from Mosque Number 7 who had joined him: ""They will feel betrayed."" Said others, ""A great chastisement of Allah will fall upon a hypocrite."" Mr. Muhammad reportedly had said at another time, ""Malcolm is destroying himself,"" and that he had no wish whatever to see Malcolm X die, that he ""would rather see him live and suffer his treachery.""

The general feeling among Harlemites, non-Muslims, with whom I talked was that Malcolm X had been powerful and influential enough a minister that eventually he would split the mosque membership into two hostile camps, and that in New York City at least, Elijah Muhammad's unquestioned rule would be ended.

Malcolm X returned. He said that he had been in Boston and Philadelphia. He spent ample time with me, now during the day, in Room 1936 in the Hotel Americana. His old total ease was no longer with him. As if it was the most natural thing in the world to do, at sudden intervals he would stride to the door; pulling it open, he would look up and down the corridor, then shut the door again. ""If I'm alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle,"" he said by way of explanation. ""I'm not saying it distressingly --"" He leaned forward and touched the buff gold bedspread. ""I'm saying it like I say that's a bedspread.""

For the first time he talked with me in some detail about what had happened. He said that his statement about President Kennedy's assassination was not why he had been ousted from the Muslims. ""It wasn't the reason at all. Nobody said anything when I made stronger statements before."" The real reason, he said, was ""jealousy in Chicago, and I had objected to the immorality of the man who professed to be more moral than anybody.""

Malcolm X said that he had increased the Nation of Islam membership from about four hundred when he had joined to around forty thousand. ""I don't think there were more than four hundred in the country when I joined, I really don't. They were mostly older people, and many of them couldn't even pronounce Mr. Muhammad's name, and he stayed mostly in the background.""

Malcolm X worked hard not to show it, but he was upset. ""There is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action. Goethe,"" he scribbled one day. He hinted about Cassius Clay a couple of times, and when I responded only with anecdotes about my interview with Clay, he finally asked what Clay had said of him. I dug out the index card on which the question was typed in advance and Clay's response was beneath in longhand. Malcolm X stared at the card, then out of the window, and he got up and walked around; one of the few times I ever heard his voice betray his hurt was when he said, ""I felt like a blood bigbrother to him."" He paused. ""I'm not against him now. He's a fine young man. Smart. He's just let himself be used, led astray.""

And at another time there in the hotel room he came the nearest to tears that I ever saw him, and also the only time I ever heard him use, for his race, one word. He had been talking about how hard he had worked building up the Muslim organization in the early days when he was first moved to New York City, when abruptly he exclaimed hoarsely, ""We had the best organization the black man's ever had -- niggers ruined it!""

A few days later, however, he wrote in one of his memo books this, which he let me read, ""Children have a lesson adults should learn, to not be ashamed of failing, but to get up and try again. Most of us adults are so afraid, so cautious, so `safe,' and therefore so shrinking and rigid and afraid that it is why so many humans fail. Most middle-aged adults have resigned themselves to failure.""

Telephone calls came frequently for Malcolm X when he was in the room with me, or he would make calls; he would talk in a covert, guarded manner, clearly not wishing me to be able to follow the discussion. I took to going into the bathroom at these times, and closing the door, emerging when the murmuring of his voice had stopped -- hoping that made him more comfortable. Later, he would tell me that he was hearing from some Muslims who were still ostensibly Elijah Muhammad's followers. ""I'm a marked man,"" he said one day, after such a call. ""I've had highly placed people tell me to be very careful every move I make."" He thought about it. ""Just as long as my family doesn't get hurt, I'm not frightened for myself."" I have the impression that Malcolm X heard in advance that the Muslim organization was going to sue to make him vacate the home he and his family lived in.

I had become worried that Malcolm X, bitter, would want to go back through the chapters in which he had told of his Black Muslim days and re-edit them in some way. The day before I left New York City to return upstate, I raised my concern to Malcolm X. ""I have thought about that,"" he said. ""There are a lot of things I could say that passed through my mind at times even then, things I saw and heard, but I threw them out of my mind. I'm going to let it stand the way I've told it. I want the book to be the way it was.""

Then -- March 26, 1964 -- a note came from Malcolm X: ""There is a chance that I may make a quick trip to several very important countries in Africa, including a pilgrimage to the Muslim Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina, beginning about April 13th. Keep this to yourself.""

While abroad, Malcolm X wrote letters and postcards to almost everyone he knew well. His letters now were signed ""El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.""

Then, in mid-May, Sister Betty telephoned me, her voice jubilant: Malcolm X was returning. I flew to New York City. On May 21, the phone rang in my hotel room and Sister Betty said, ""Just a minute, please --"" then the deep voice said, ""How are you?""

""Well! El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz! How are you?""

He said, ""Just a little bit tired."" He had arrived on a Pan-American

Airlines flight at 4:30. He was going to have a press conference at seven P.M. at the Hotel Theresa. ""I'll pick you up at 6:30 at 135th and Lenox, on the uptown side -- all right?""

When the blue Oldsmobile stopped, and I got in, El-Hajj Malcolm, broadly beaming, wore a seersucker suit, the red hair needed a barber's attention, and he had grown a beard. Also in the car was Sister Betty. It was the first time we had ever seen each other after more than a year of talking several times a week on the telephone. We smiled at each other. She wore dark glasses, a blue maternity suit, and she was pregnant with what would be her fourth child.

There must have been fifty still and television photographers and reporters jockeying for position, up front, and the rest of the Skyline Ballroom was filling with Negro followers of Malcolm X, or his well-wishers, and the curious. The room lit up with flickering and flooding lights as he came in the door squiring Sister Betty, holding her arm tenderly, and she was smiling broadly in her pride that this man was her man. I recognized the Times' M. S. Handler and introduced myself; we warmly shook hands and commandeered a little two-chair table. The reporters in a thick semicircle before Malcolm X seated on the podium fired questions at him, and he gave the impression that all of his twelve years' oratorical practice had prepared him for this new image.

""Do we correctly understand that you now do not think that all whites are evil?""

""True, sir! My trip to Mecca has opened my eyes. I no longer subscribe to racism. I have adjusted my thinking to the point where I believe that whites are human beings"" -- a significant pause -- ""as long as this is borne out by their humane attitude toward Negroes.""

They picked at his ""racist"" image. ""I'm not a racist. I'm not condemning whites for being whites, but for their needs. I condemn what whites collectively have done to our people collectively.""

He almost continually flashed about the room the ingratiating boyish smile. He would pick at the new reddish beard. They asked him about that, did he plan to keep it? He said he hadn't decided yet, he would have to see if he could get used to it or not. Was he maneuvering to now join the major civil rights leaders whom he had previously bitterly attacked? He answered that one sideways: ""I'll explain it this way, sir. If some men are in a car, driving with a destination in mind, and you know they are going the wrong way, but they are convinced they are going the right way, then you get into the car with them, and ride with them, talking -- and finally when they see they are on the wrong road, not getting where they were intending, then you tell them, and they will listen to you then, what road to take."" He had never been in better form, weighing, parrying, answering the questions.

The Times' Handler, beside me, was taking notes and muttering under his breath, ""Incredible! Incredible!"" I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking, some of the time, that if a pebble were dropped from the window behind Malcolm X, it would have struck on a sidewalk eight floors below where years before he had skulked, selling dope.

As I resumed writing upstate, periodic notes came from Malcolm X. ""I hope the book is proceeding rapidly, for events concerning my life happen so swiftly, much of what has already been written can easily be outdated from month to month. In life, nothing is permanent; not even life itself (smile). So I would advise you to rush it on out as fast as possible."" Another note, special delivery, had a tone of irritation with me: he had received from the publisher a letter which indicated that he had received a $2500 check when the book contract was signed, ""and therefore I will be expected to pay personal income tax on this. As you know, it was my repeated specification that this entire transaction was to be made at that time directly with and to the Mosque. In fact, I have never seen that check to this very day.""

The matter was straightened out, and I sent Malcolm X some rough chapters to read. I was appalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm X, I reminded him of his previous decision, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what would lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. Malcolm X said, gruffly, ""Whose book is this?"" I told him ""Yours, of course,"" and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. He said that he would have to think about it. I was heartsick at the prospect that he might want to re-edit the entire book into a polemic against Elijah Muhammad. But late that night, Malcolm X telephoned. ""I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand."" I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said. And the only thing that he ever indicated that he wished had been different in his life came when he was reading the chapter ""Laura."" He said, ""That was a smart girl, a good girl. She tried her best to make something out of me, and look what I started her into -- dope and prostitution. I wrecked that girl.""

Malcolm X was busy, busy, busy; he could not visit my hotel room often, and when he did, it shortly would get the feeling of Grand Central Station. It seemed that when the telephone was not ringing for him, he was calling someone else, consulting the jotted numbers in his ever-ready memorandum book. Now he had begun to talk a great deal with various people from the Middle East or Africa who were in New York. Some of these came to see him at the hotel room. At first, I would sit by the window engrossed in reading while they talked by the room's door in low tones. He was very apologetic when this occurred, and I told him I felt no sensitivity about it; then, afterwards, I would generally step out into the hallway, or perhaps take the elevator down to the lobby, then watch the elevators until I saw the visitor leave. One day, I remember, the phone had rung steadily with such callers as C.B.S., A.B.C., N.B.C., every New York City paper, the London Daily Express, and numerous individuals -- he and I had gotten no work at all accomplished; then a television camera crew arrived and filled the room to tape an interview with Malcolm X by A.B.C.'s commentator Bill Beutel. As the crew was setting up its floodlights on tripods, a Dayton,

Ohio, radio station called, wishing to interview Malcolm X by telephone. He asked me to ask them to call him the following day at his sister Ella's home in Boston. Then the Ghana Ministry of Information called. I turned with a note to Malcolm X to whom the commentator Beutel had just said, ""I won't take much of your time, I just have a few probably stupid questions."" Glancing at my note, Malcolm X said to Beutel, ""Only the unasked question is stupid,"" and then to me, ""Tell them I'll call them back, please."" Then just as the television cameras began rolling, with Beutel and Malcolm X talking, the telephone rang again and it was Life magazine reporter Marc Crawford to whom I whispered what was happening. Crawford, undaunted, asked if the open receiver could be placed where he could hear the interview, and I complied, relieved that it was one way to let the interview proceed without interruption.

The manuscript copy which Malcolm X was given to review was in better shape now, and he pored through page by page, intently, and now and then his head would raise with some comment. ""You know,"" he said once, ""why I have been able to have some effect is because I make a study of the weaknesses of this country and because the more the white man yelps, the more I know I have struck a nerve."" Another time, he put down upon the bed the manuscript he was reading, and he got up from his chair and walked back and forth, stroking his chin, then he looked at me. ""You know this place here in this chapter where I told you how I put the pistol up to my head and kept pulling the trigger and scared them so when I was starting the burglary ring -- well,"" he paused, ""I don't know if I ought to tell you this or not, but I want to tell the truth."" He eyed me, speculatively. ""I palmed the bullet."" We laughed together. I said, ""Okay, give that page here, I'll fix it."" Then he considered, ""No, leave it that way. Too many people would be so quick to say that's what I'm doing today, bluffing.""

Again when reading about the period when he had discovered the prison library, Malcolm X's head jerked up. ""Boy! I never will forget that old aardvark!"" The next evening, he came into the room and told me that he had been to the Museum of Natural History and learned something about the aardvark. ""Now, aardvark actually means `earth hog.' That's a good example of root words, as I was telling you. When you study the science of philology, you learn the laws governing how a consonant can lose its shape, but it keeps its identity from language to language."" What astonished me here was that I knew that on that day, Malcolm X's schedule had been crushing, involving both a television and radio appearance and a live speech, yet he had gone to find out something about the aardvark.

Before long, Malcolm X called a press conference, and announced, ""My new Organization of Afro-American Unity is a non-religious and non-sectarian group organized to unite Afro-Americans for a constructive program toward attainment of human rights."" The new OAAU's tone appeared to be one of militant black nationalism. He said to the questions of various reporters in subsequent interviews that the OAAU would seek to convert the Negro population from non-violence to active self-defense against white supremacists across America. On the subject of politics he offered an enigma, ""Whether you use bullets or ballots, you've got to aim well; don't strike at the puppet, strike at the puppeteer."" Did he envision any special area of activity? ""I'm going to join in the fight wherever Negroes ask for my help."" What about alliance with other Negro organizations? He said that he would consider forming some united front with certain selected Negro leaders. He conceded under questioning that the N.A.A.C.P. was ""doing some good."" Could any whites join his OAAU? ""If John Brown were alive, maybe him."" And he answered his critics with such statements as that he would send ""armed guerrillas"" into Mississippi. ""I am dead serious. We will send them not only to Mississippi, but to any place where black people's lives are threatened by white bigots. As far as I am concerned, Mississippi is anywhere south of the Canadian border."" At another time, when Evelyn Cunningham of the Pittsburgh Courier asked Malcolm X in a kidding way, ""Say something startling for my column,"" he told her, ""Anyone who wants to follow me and my movement has got to be ready to go to jail, to the hospital, and to the cemetery before he can be truly free."" Evelyn Cunningham, printing the item, commented, ""He smiled and chuckled, but he was in dead earnest.""

His fourth child, yet another daughter, was born and he and Sister Betty named the baby Gamilah Lumumbah. A young waitress named Helen Lanier, at Harlem's Twenty Two Club where Malcolm X now often asked people to meet him, gave him a layette for the new baby. He was very deeply touched by the gesture. ""Why, I hardly know that girl!""

He was clearly irked when a New York Times poll among New York City Negroes reflected that three-fourths had named Dr. Martin Luther King as ""doing the best work for Negroes,"" and another one-fifth had voted for the N.A.A.C.P.'s Roy wilkins, while only six percent had voted for Malcolm X. ""Brother,"" he said to me, ""do you realize that some of history's greatest leaders never were recognized until they were safely in the ground!""

One morning in mid-summer 1964, Malcolm X telephoned me and said that he would be leaving ""within the next two or three days"" for a planned six weeks abroad. I heard from him first in Cairo, about as the predicted ""long, hot summer"" began in earnest, with riots and other uprisings of Negroes occurring in surburban Philadelphia, in Rochester, in Brooklyn, in Harlem, and other cities. The New York Times reported that a meeting of Negro intellectuals had agreed that Dr. Martin Luther King could secure the allegiance of the middle and upper classes of Negroes, but Malcolm X alone could secure the allegiance of Negroes at the bottom. ""The Negroes respect Dr. King and Malcolm X because they sense in these men absolute integrity and know they will never sell them out. Malcolm X cannot be corrupted and the Negroes know this and therefore respect him. They also know that he comes from the lower depths, as they do, and regard him as one of their own. Malcolm X is going to play a formidable role, because the racial struggle has now shifted to the urban North . . . if Dr. King is convinced that he has sacrificed ten years of brilliant leadership, he will be forced to revise his concepts. There is only one direction in which he can move, and that is in the direction of Malcolm X."" I sent a clipping of that story to Malcolm X in Cairo.

In Washington, D.C. and New York City, at least, powerful civic, private, and governmental agencies and individuals were keenly interested in what Malcolm X was saying abroad, and were speculating upon what would he say, and possibly do, when he returned to America. In upstate New York, I received a telephone call from a close friend who said he had been asked to ask me if I would come to New York City on an appointed day to meet with ""a very high government official"" who was interested in Malcolm X. I did fly down to the city. My friend accompanied me to the offices of a large private foundation well known for its activities and donations in the civil rights area. I met the foundation's president and he introduced me to the Justice Department Civil Rights Section head, Burke Marshall. Marshall was chiefly interested in Malcolm X's finances, particularly how his extensive traveling since his Black Muslim ouster had been paid for. I told him that to the best of my knowledge the several payments from the publisher had financed Malcolm X, along with fees he received for some speeches, and possible donations that his organization received, and that Malcolm X had told me of borrowing money from his Sister Ella for the current trip, and that recently the Saturday Evening Post had bought the condensation rights of the book for a substantial sum that was soon to be received. Marshall listened quietly, intently, and asked a few questions concerning other aspects of Malcolm X's life, then thanked me. I wrote to Malcolm X in Cairo that night about the interview. He never mentioned it.

The Saturday Evening Post flew photographer John Launois to Cairo to locate Malcolm X and photograph him in color. The magazine's September 12 issue appeared, and I sent a copy by airmail to Malcolm X. Within a few days, I received a stinging note, expressing his anger at the magazine's editorial regarding his life story. (The editorial's opening sentence read, ""If Malcolm X were not a Negro, his autobiography would be little more than a journal of abnormal psychology, the story of a burglar, dope pusher, addict and jailbird -- with a family history of insanity -- who acquires messianic delusions and sets forth to preach an upside-down religion of `brotherly' hatred."") I wrote to Malcolm X that he could not fairly hold me responsible for what the magazine had written in a separate editorial opinion. He wrote an apology, ""but the greatest care must be exercised in the future.""

His return from Africa was even more auspicious than when he had returned from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. A large group of Negroes, his followers and well-wishers, kept gathering in the Overseas Arrival Building at Kennedy Airport. When I entered, white men with cameras were positioned on the second level, taking pictures of all the Negroes who entered, and almost as obvious were Negro plainclothesmen moving about. Malcolm's greeters had draped across the glass overlooking the U.S. Customs Inspection line some large cloth banners on which were painted in bold letters, ""Welcome Home, Malcolm.""

He came in sight, stepping into one of the Customs Inspection lines; he heard the cheering and he looked up, smiling his pleasure.



Malcolm X wanted to ""huddle"" with me to fill me in on details from his trip that he wanted in the book. He said that he was giving me only the highlights, because he felt that his carefully kept diary might be turned into another book. We had intensive sessions in my hotel room, where he read what he selected from the diary, and I took notes. ""What I want to stress is that I was trying to internationalize our problem,"" he said to me, ""to make the Africans feel their kinship with us Afro-Americans. I made them think about it, that they are our blood brothers, and we all came from the same foreparents. That's why the Africans loved me, the same way the Asians loved me because I was religious.""

Within a few days, he had no more time to see me. He would call and apologize; he was beset by a host of problems, some of which he mentioned, and some of which I heard from other people. Most immediately, there was discontent within his organization, the OAAU. His having stayed away almost three times as long as he had said he would be gone had sorely tested the morale of even his key members, and there was a general feeling that his interest was insufficient to expect his followers' interest to stay high. I heard from one member that ""a growing disillusion"" could be sensed throughout the organization.

In Harlem at large, in the bars and restaurants, on the street corners and stoops, there could be heard more blunt criticism of Malcolm X than ever before in his career. There were, variously expressed, two primary complaints. One was that actually Malcolm X only talked, but other civil rights organizations were doing. ""All he's ever done was talk, CORE and SNCC and some of them people of Dr. King's are out getting beat over the head."" The second major complaint was that Malcolm X was himself too confused to be seriously followed any longer. ""He doesn't know what he believes in. No sooner do you hear one thing than he's switched to something else."" The two complaints were not helping the old firebrand Malcolm X image any, nor were they generating the local public interest that was badly needed by his small, young OAAU.

A court had made it clear that Malcolm X and his family would have to vacate the Elmhurst house for its return to the adjudged legal owners, Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam. And other immediate problems which Malcolm X faced included finances. Among his other expenses, a wife and four daughters had to be supported, along with at least one full-time OAAU official. Upon his return from Africa, our agent for the book had delivered to me for Malcolm X a check for a sizable sum; soon afterward Malcolm X told me, laughing wryly, ""It's evaporated. I don't know where!""

Malcolm X plunged into a welter of activities. He wrote and telephoned dozens of acceptances to invitations to speak, predominantly at colleges and universities -- both to expound his philosophies and to earn the $150-$300 honorariums above traveling expenses. When he was in New York City, he spent all the time he could in his OAAU's sparsely furnished office on the mezzanine floor of the Hotel Theresa, trying to do something about the OAAU's knotty problems. ""I'm not exposing our size in numbers,"" he evaded the query of one reporter. ""You know, the strongest part of a tree is the root, and if you expose the root, the tree dies. Why, we have many `invisible' members, of all types. Unlike other leaders, I've practiced the flexibility to put myself into contact with every kind of Negro in the country.""

Even at mealtimes, at his favorite Twenty Two Club, or elsewhere in Harlem, he could scarcely eat for the people who came up asking for appointments to discuss with him topics ranging from personal problems to his opinions on international issues. It seemed not in him to say ""No"" to such requests. And aides of his, volunteering their time, as often as not had to wait lengthy periods to get his ear for matters important to the OAAU, or to himself; often, even then, he most uncharacteristically showed an impatience with their questions or their suggestions, and they chafed visibly. And at least once weekly, generally on Sunday evenings, he would address as many Negroes as word of mouth and mimeographed advertising could draw to hear him in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom on West 166th Street between Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue, near New York City's famous Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.

Malcolm X for some reason suddenly began to deliver a spate of attacks against Elijah Muhammad, making more bitter accusations of ""religious fakery"" and ""immorality"" than he ever had. Very possibly, Malcolm X had grown increasingly incensed by the imminence of the court's deadline for him to have to move his wife and four little daughters from the comfortable home in which they had lived for years in Elmhurst. And Sister Betty was again pregnant. ""A home is really the only thing I've ever provided Betty since we've been married,"" he had told me, discussing the court's order, ""and they want to take that away. Man, I can't keep on putting her through changes, all she's put up with -- man, I've got to love this woman!""

A rash of death threats were anonymously telephoned to the police, to various newspapers, to the OAAU office, and to the family's home in Elmhurst. When he went to court again, fighting to keep the house, he was guarded by a phalanx of eight OAAU men, twenty uniformed policemen, and twelve plain-clothes detectives. The court's decision was that the order to vacate would not be altered. When Malcolm X reached home in Long Island, one of his followers, telephoning him there, got, instead, a telephone company operator who said that the OL 1-6320 number was ""disconnected."" A carload of his OAAU followers, racing to Long Island, found Malcolm X and his family perfectly safe. Inquiry of the telephone company revealed that a ""Mrs. Small"" had called and requested that the service for that number be disconnected, ""for vacation."" The OAAU followers drove back to Harlem. There was an ensuing confrontation between them and followers of Elijah Muhammad in front of the Black Muslim restaurant at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue. The incident wound up with policemen who rushed to the scene finding two guns in the OAAU car, and the six OAAU men were arrested.

Malcolm X had a date to speak in Boston, but he was too busy to go, and he sent an OAAU assistant who spoke instead. The car returning him to the Boston Airport was blocked at the East Boston Tunnel by another car. Reportedly, men with knives rushed out of the blockade car, but the Malcolm X forces showed a shotgun, and the attackers dispersed.

Malcolm X steadily accused the Black Muslims as the source of the various attacks and threats. ""There is no group in the United States more able to carry out this threat than the Black Muslims,"" he said. ""I know, because I taught them myself."" Asked why he had attacked the Black Muslims and Elijah Muhammad when things had seemed to be cooled down, he said, ""I would not have revealed any of this if they had left me alone."" He let himself be photographed in his home holding an automatic carbine rifle with a full double clip of ammunition that he said he kept ready for action against any possible assassination efforts. ""I have taught my wife to use it, and instructed her to fire on anyone, white, black, or yellow, who tries to force his way inside.""

I went to New York City in December for Malcolm X's reading of final additions to the manuscript, to include the latest developments. He was further than I had ever seen him from his old assured self, it seemed to me. He kept saying that the press was making light of his statements about the threats on his life. ""They act like I'm jiving!"" He brought up again the Saturday Evening Post editorial. ""You can't trust the publishing people, I don't care what they tell you."" The agent for the book sent to my hotel a contract dealing with foreign publication rights which needed Malcolm X's and my signature. I signed it as he observed and handed the pen to him. He looked suspiciously at the contract, and said, ""I had better show this thing to my lawyer,"" and put the contract in his inside coat pocket. Driving in Harlem about an hour later, he suddenly stopped the car across the street from the 135th Street Y.M.C.A. Building. Withdrawing the contract, he signed it, and thrust it to me. ""I'll trust you,"" he said, and drove on.

With Christmas approaching, upon an impulse I bought for Malcolm X's two oldest daughters two large dolls, with painted brown complexions, the kind of dolls that would ""walk"" when held by the left hand. When Malcolm X next came to my room in the Hotel Wellington, I said, ""I've gotten something for you to take to Attallah and Qubilah for Christmas gifts,"" and I ""walked"" out the dolls. Amazement, then a wide grin spread over his face. ""Well, what do you know about that? Well, how about that!"" He bent to examine the dolls. His expression showed how touched he was. ""You know,"" he said after a while, ""this isn't something I'm proud to say, but I don't think I've ever bought one gift for my children. Everything they play with, either Betty got it for them, or somebody gave it to them, never me. That's not good, I know it. I've always been too busy.""

In early January, I flew from upstate New York to Kennedy Airport where I telephoned Malcolm X at home and told him that I was waiting for another plane to Kansas City to witness the swearing-in of my younger brother George who had recently been elected a Kansas State Senator. ""Tell your brother for me to remember us in the alley,"" Malcolm X said. ""Tell him that he and all of the other moderate Negroes who are getting somewhere need to always remember that it was us extremists who made it possible."" He said that when I was ready to leave Kansas, to telephone him saying when I would arrive back in New York, and if he could we could get together. I did this, and he met me at Kennedy Airport. He had only a little while, he was so pressed, he said; he had to leave that afternoon himself for a speaking engagement which had come up. So I made reservations for the next flight back upstate, then we went outside and sat and talked in his car in a parking lot. He talked about the pressures on him everywhere he turned, and about the frustrations, among them that no one wanted to accept anything relating to him except ""my old `hate' and `violence' image."" He said ""the so-called moderate"" civil rights organizations avoided him as ""too militant"" and the ""so-called militants"" avoided him as ""too moderate."" ""They won't let me turn the corner!"" he once exclaimed, ""I'm caught in a trap!""

In a happier area, we talked about the coming baby. We laughed about the four girls in a row already. ""This one will be the boy,"" he said. He beamed, ""If not, the next one!"" When I said it was close to time for my plane to leave, he said he had to be getting on, too. I said, ""Give my best to Sister Betty,"" he said that he would, we shook hands and I got outside and stood as he backed the blue Oldsmobile from its parking space. I called out ""See you!"" and we waved as he started driving away. There was no way to know that it was the last time I would see him alive.

On January 19, Malcolm X appeared on the Pierre Berton television show in Canada and said, in response to a question about integration and intermarriage:

""I believe in recognizing every human being as a human being -- neither white, black, brown, or red; and when you are dealing with humanity as a family there's no question of integration or intermarriage. It's just one human being marrying another human being or one human being living around and with another human being. I may say, though, that I don't think it should ever be put upon a black man, I don't think the burden to defend any position should ever be put upon the black man, because it is the white man collectively who has shown that he is hostile toward integration and toward intermarriage and toward these other strides toward oneness. So as a black man and especially as a black American, any stand that I formerly took, I don't think that I would have to defend it because it's still a reaction to the society, and it's a reaction that was produced by the society; and I think that it is the society that produced this that should be attacked, not the reaction that develops among the people who are the victims of that negative society.""

From this, it would be fair to say that one month before his death, Malcolm had revised his views on intermarriage to the point where he regarded it as simply a personal matter.

On the 28th of January, Malcolm X was on TWA's Flight No. 9 from New York that landed at about three P.M. in Los Angeles. A special police intelligence squad saw Malcolm X greeted by two close friends, Edward Bradley and Allen Jamal, who drove him to the Statler-Hilton Hotel where Malcolm X checked into Room 1129. Said Bradley, ""As we entered the lobby, six men came in right after us. I recognized them as Black Muslims."" When Malcolm X returned downstairs to the lobby, he ""practically bumped into the Muslim entourage. The Muslims were stunned. Malcolm's face froze, but he never broke his gait. Then, we knew we were facing trouble."" Malcolm X's friends drove him to pick up ""two former secretaries of Elijah Muhammad, who (had) filed paternity suits against him,"" and they went to the office of the colorful Los Angeles attorney Gladys Root. Mrs. Root said that Malcolm X made accusations about Elijah Muhammad's conduct with various former secretaries.

After dinner, Malcolm X's two friends drove him back to the hotel. ""Black Muslims were all over the place,"" Bradley related. ""Some were in cars and others stood around near the hotel. They had the hotel completely surrounded. Malcolm sized up the situation and jumped out of the car. He warned me to watch out and ran into the lobby. He went to his room and remained there for the rest of his stay in Los Angeles.""

The car in which Malcolm X left the hotel, bound for the airport, was followed, said Bradley. ""Hardly had we got on the freeway when we saw two carloads of Black Muslims following us. The cars started to pull alongside. Malcolm picked up my walking cane and stuck it out of a back window as if it were a rifle. The two cars fell behind. We picked up speed, pulled off the airport ramp, and roared up to the front of the terminal. The police were waiting and Malcolm was escorted to the plane through an underground passageway. Then I saw Malcolm to the plane.""

Chicago police were waiting when the plane landed at O'Hare Airport that night at eight o'clock. Driven to the Bristol Hotel, Malcolm X checked in, and the adjoining suite was taken by members of the police force who would keep him under steady guard for the next three days in Chicago. Malcolm X testified at the office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois which had been investigating the Nation of Islam. Another day he appeared on the television program of Irv Kupcinet; he described attempts that had been made to kill him. He said he had on his desk a letter naming the persons assigned to kill him. When police returned Malcolm X to his hotel ""at least fifteen grimfaced Negroes (were) loitering nearby."" Whispered Malcolm X to Detective Sergeant Edward McClellan, ""Those are all Black Muslims. At least two of them I recognize as being from New York. Elijah seems to know every move I make."" Later, in his room, he told the detective, ""It's only going to be a matter of time before they catch up with me. I know too much about the Muslims. But their threats are not going to stop me from what I am determined to do."" After that night spent in the hotel, Malcolm X was police-escorted back to O'Hare where he caught a plane to New York City's Kennedy Airport.

Right away, he was served with a court order of eviction from the Elmhurst home. He telephoned me upstate. His voice was strained. He told me that he had filed an appeal to the court order, that on the next day he was going to Alabama, and thence to England and France for scheduled speeches, and soon after returning he would go to Jackson, Mississippi, to address the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, on February 19. Then he said -- the first time he had ever voiced to me such an admission -- ""Haley, my nerves are shot, my brain's tired."" He said that upon his return from Mississippi, he would like to come and spend two or three days in the town where I was, and read the book's manuscript again. ""You say it's a quiet town. Just a couple of days of peace and quiet, that's what I need."" I said that he knew he was welcome, but there was no need for him to tax himself reading through the long book again, as it had only a few very minor editing changes since he had only recently read it. ""I just want to read it one more time,"" he said, ""because I don't expect to read it in finished form."" So we made a tentative agreement that the day after his projected return from Mississippi, he would fly upstate to visit for a weekend with me. The projected date was the Saturday and Sunday of February 20-21.

Jet magazine reported Malcolm X's trip to Selma, Alabama, on the invitation of two members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Dr. Martin Luther King was in a Selma jail when Malcolm X's arrival sent officials of Dr. King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference ""into a tailspin."" Quickly, the SCLC's Executive Director Reverend Andrew Young and Reverend James Bevel met with Malcolm X, urging him not to incite any incidents and cautioning him that his presence could cause violence. ""He listened with a smile,"" said Miss Faye Bellamy, secretary of the SNCC, who accompanied Malcolm X to a Negro church where he would address a mass meeting. ""Remember this: nobody puts words in my mouth,"" he told Miss Bellamy. He told her that ""in about two weeks"" he planned to start Southern recruiting for his Harlem-based OAAU. At the church where he would speak, Malcolm X was seated on the platform next to Mrs. Martin Luther King, to whom he leaned and whispered that he was ""trying to help,"" she told Jet. ""He said he wanted to present an alternative; that it might be easier for whites to accept Martin's proposals after hearing him (Malcolm X). I didn't understand him at first,"" said Mrs. King. ""He seemed rather anxious to let Martin know he was not causing trouble or making it difficult, but that he was trying to make it easier. . . . Later, in the hallway, he reiterated this. He seemed sincere. . . .""

Addressing the mass meeting Malcolm X reportedly shouted: ""I don't advocate violence, but if a man steps on my toes, I'll step on his."" . . . ""Whites better be glad Martin Luther King is rallying the people because other forces are waiting to take over if he fails.""

Returned to New York City, Malcolm X soon flew to France. He was scheduled to speak before a Congress of African Students. But he was formally advised that he would not be permitted to speak and, moreover, that he could consider himself officially barred forever from France as ""an undesirable person."" He was asked to leave -- and he did, fuming with indignation.

He flew on to London, and reporters of the British Broadcasting Corporation took him on an interviewing tour in Smethwick, a town near Birmingham with a large colored population. Numerous residents raised a storm of criticism that the B.B.C. was a party to a ""fanning of racism"" in the already tension-filled community. On this visit, he spoke also at the London School of Economics.

Malcolm X returned to New York City on Saturday, February 13th. He was asleep with his family when at about a quarter of three the following Sunday morning, a terrifying blast awakened them. Sister Betty would tell me later that Malcolm X, barking commands and snatching up screaming, frightened children, got the family safely out of the back door into the yard. Someone had thrown flaming Molotov cocktail gasoline bombs through the front picture window. It took the fire department an hour to extinguish the flames. Half the house was destroyed. Malcolm X had no fire insurance.

Pregnant, distraught Sister Betty and the four little daughters went to the home of close friends. Malcolm X steeled himself to catch a plane as scheduled that morning to speak in Detroit. He wore an open-necked sweater shirt under his suit. Immediately afterward, he flew back to New York. Monday morning, amid a flurry of emergency re-housing plans for his family, Malcolm X was outraged when he learned that Elijah Muhammad's New York Mosque Number 7 Minister James X had told the press that Malcolm X himself had fire-bombed the home ""to get publicity.""

Monday night, Malcolm X spoke to an audience in the familiar Audubon Ballroom. If he had possessed the steel nerves not to become rattled in public before, now he was: ""I've reached the end of my rope!"" he shouted to the audience of five hundred. ""I wouldn't care for myself if they would not harm my family!"" He declared flatly, ""My house was bombed by the Muslims!"" And he hinted at revenge. ""There are hunters; there are also those who hunt the hunters!""

Tuesday, February 16th, Malcolm X telephoned me. He spoke very briefly, saying that the complications following the bombing of his home had thrown his plans so awry that he would be unable to visit me upstate on the weekend as he had said he would. He said he had also had to cancel his planned trip to Jackson, Mississippi, which he was going to try and make later. He said he had to hurry to an appointment, and hung up. I would read later where also on that day, he told a close associate, ""I have been marked for death in the next five days. I have the names of five Black Muslims who have been chosen to kill me. I will announce them at the meeting."" And Malcolm X told a friend that he was going to apply to the Police Department for a permit to carry a pistol. ""I don't know whether they will let me have one or not, as I served time in prison.""

On Thursday he told a reporter, in an interview which did not appear until after his death: ""I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible.""

The blackboard in the OAAU office counseled members and visitors that ""Bro. Malcolm Speaks Thurs. Feb. 18, WINS Station, 10:30 P.M."" Earlier Thursday, Malcolm X discussed locating another home with a real estate dealer. On Friday, he had an appointment with Gordon Parks, the Life magazine photographer-author whom he had long admired and respected. ""He appeared calm and somewhat resplendent with his goatee and astrakhan hat,"" Parks would report later in Life. ""Much of the old hostility and bitterness seemed to have left him, but the fire and confidence were still there."" Malcolm X, speaking of the old Mosque Number 7 days, said, ""That was a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those days -- I'm glad to be free of them. It's a time for martyrs now. And if I'm to be one, it will be in the cause of brotherhood. That's the only thing that can save this country. I've learned it the hard way -- but I've learned it. . . .""

Parks asked Malcolm X if it was really true that killers were after him. ""It's as true as we are standing here,"" Malcolm X said. ""They've tried it twice in the last two weeks."" Parks asked him about police protection, and Malcolm X laughed, ""Brother, nobody can protect you from a Muslim but a Muslim -- or someone trained in Muslim tactics. I know. I invented many of those tactics.""

Recalling the incident of the young white college girl who had come to the Black Muslim restaurant and asked ""What can I do?"" and he told her ""Nothing,"" and she left in tears, Malcolm X told Gordon Parks, ""Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then -- like all Muslims -- I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me twelve years.""

Saturday morning, he drove Sister Betty to see a real estate man. The house that the man then showed them that Malcolm X particularly liked, in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood also on Long Island, required a $3000 down payment. Sister Betty indicated her approval, too, and Malcolm X told the real estate man he thought they would take it. Driving Sister Betty back to the friends' home where she was staying with the children, they estimated that it would cost them about another $1000 to make the move. He stayed until mid-afternoon with Sister Betty at the friends' home, talking. He told her that he realized that she had been under protracted great strain, and that he was sorry about it. When he got his hat to leave, to drive into Manhattan, standing in the hallway, he told Sister Betty, ""We'll all be together. I want my family with me. Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you. We'll get somebody to keep the children. I'll never leave you so long again.""

""I couldn't help but just break out grinning,"" Sister Betty would later tell me.

She figured that he must have stopped at a nearby drugstore to use the telephone booth when I later told her that Malcolm X had telephoned me upstate at about 3:30 that afternoon.

For the first time in nearly two years, I did not recognize immediately that the voice on the other end of the phone belonged to Malcolm X. He sounded as if he had a heavy, deep cold. He told me that in the middle of the night he and some friends had helped a moving company's men take out of the other house all of the family's furniture and other belongings salvageable after the fire-bombing -- before a sheriff's eviction party would set the things out on the sidewalk. ""Betty and I have been looking at a house we want to buy"" -- he tried a chuckle -- ""you know nobody's going to rent, not to me, these days!"" He said, ""All I've got is about $150,"" and that he needed a $3000 down payment plus $1000 moving costs; he asked if I thought the publisher would advance him $4000 against the projected profits from the book. I said that when our agent's offices opened on Monday morning, I would telephone and I knew that he would query the publisher to see if it couldn't be arranged, then Monday night I would call him back and let him know.

He said that he and Sister Betty had decided that although they were going to pay for the house, to avoid possible trouble they had gotten the agreement of his sister Ella who lived in Boston to let the house be bought in her name. He said that he still owed $1500 to his sister Ella which she had loaned him to make one trip abroad. Eventually they would change the house's title into Sister Betty's name, he said, or maybe into the name of their oldest daughter, Attilah.

He digressed on the dangers he faced. ""But, you know, I'm going to tell you something, brother -- the more I keep thinking about this thing, the things that have been happening lately, I'm not all that sure it's the Muslims. I know what they can do, and what they can't, and they can't do some of the stuff recently going on. Now, I'm going to tell you, the more I keep thinking about what happened to me in France, I think I'm going to quit saying it's the Muslims.""

Then -- it seemed to me such an odd, abrupt change of subject: ""You know, I'm glad I've been the first to establish official ties between Afro-Americans and our blood brothers in Africa."" And saying good-bye, he hung up.

After that telephone call, Malcolm X drove on into Manhattan and to the New York Hilton Hotel between 53rd and 54th streets at Rockefeller Center. He checked the blue Oldsmobile into the hotel garage and then, in the lobby, he checked himself in and was assigned a twelfth-floor room, to which a bellman accompanied him.

Soon some Negro men entered the giant hotel's busy lobby.

They began asking various bellmen what room Malcolm X was in. The bellmen, of course, never would answer that question concerning any guest -- and considering that it was Malcolm X whom practically everyone who read New York City newspapers knew was receiving constant death threats, the bellmen quickly notified the hotel's security chief. From then until Malcolm X checked out the next day, extra security vigilance was continuously maintained on the twelfth floor. During that time, Malcolm X left the room only once, to have dinner in the hotel's lobby-level, dimly lit Bourbon Room.

Sunday morning at nine o'clock, Sister Betty in Long Island was surprised when her husband telephoned her and asked if she felt it would be too much trouble for her to get all of the four children dressed and bring them to the two o'clock meeting that afternoon at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem. She said, ""Of course it won't!"" On Saturday he had told her that she couldn't come to the meeting. He said to her, ""You know what happened an hour ago? Exactly at eight o'clock, the phone woke me up. Some man said, `Wake up, brother' and hung up."" Malcolm X said good-bye to Sister Betty.

And four hours later, Malcolm X left his room and took an elevator down to the lobby, where he checked out. He got his car and in the clear, warm midday of Sunday, February 21, he drove uptown to the Audubon Ballroom.

The Audubon Ballroom, between Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue, on the south side of West 166th Street, is a two-story building frequently rented for dances, organization functions, and other affairs. A dark, slender, pretty young lady, occupationally a receptionist and avocationally a hardworking OAAU assistant to Malcolm X, has since told me that she arrived early, about 1:30 P.M., having some preliminary work to do. Entering, she saw that the usual four hundred wooden chairs had been set up, with aisles on either side, but no center aisle; the young lady (she wishes to be nameless) noticed that several people were already seated in the front rows, but she gave it no thought since some always came early, liking to get seats up close to the stage, to savor to the fullest the dramatic orator Malcolm X. On the stage, behind the speaker's stand, were eight straight brown chairs arranged in a row and behind it was the stage's painted backdrop, a mural of a restful country scene. The young lady's responsibilities for this day had included making arrangements and subsequent confirmations with the scheduled co-speaker, the Reverend Milton Galamison, the militant Brooklyn Presbyterian who in 1964 had led the two one-day Negro boycotts in New York City public schools, protesting ""racial imbalance."" She had similarly made arrangements with some other prominent Negroes who were due to appeal to the audience for their maximum possible contributions to aid the work of Malcolm X and his organization.

The people who entered the ballroom were not searched at the door. In recent weeks, Malcolm X had become irritable about this, saying ""It makes people uncomfortable"" and that it reminded him of Elijah Muhammad. ""If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be?"" he had once said testily. For this day, also, he had ordered the press -- as such -- barred, white or black. He was angry at what he interpreted as ""slanted"" press treatment recently; he felt especially that the newspapers had not taken seriously his statements of the personal danger he was in. United Press International reporter Stanley Scott, a Negro, had been admitted, he later said, when a Malcolm lieutenant decided, ""As a Negro, you will be allowed to enter as a citizen if you like, but you must remove your press badge."" The same criterion had applied to WMCA newsman Hugh Simpson. Both he and Scott came early enough so that they obtained seats up near the stage.

Malcolm X entered the ballroom at shortly before two o'clock, trudging heavily instead of with his usual lithe strides, his young lady assistant has told me. By this time several other of his assistants were filtering in and out of the small anteroom alongside the stage. He sat down sideways on a chair, his long legs folded around its bottom, and he leaned one elbow on a kind of counter before a rather rickety make-up mirror that entertainers used when dances were held in the ballroom. He wore a dark suit, white shirt and narrow dark tie. He said to a little group of his assistants that he wasn't going to talk about his personal troubles, ""I don't want that to be the reason for anyone to come to hear me."" He stood up and paced about the little room. He said he was going to state that he had been hasty to accuse the Black Muslims of bombing his home. ""Things have happened since that are bigger than what they can do. I know what they can do. Things have gone beyond that.""

Those in the anteroom could hear the sounds of the enlarging audience outside taking seats. ""The way I feel, I ought not to go out there at all today,"" Malcolm X said. ""In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting among ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for."" He kept glancing at his wrist watch, anticipating the arrival of Reverend Galamison. ""Whenever you make any appointment with a minister,"" he said to his young lady assistant, ""you have to call them two or three hours before time, because they will change their mind. This is typical of ministers.""

""I felt bad, I felt that it was my fault,"" the young lady told me. ""It was time for the meeting to start, too."" She turned to Malcolm X's stalwart assistant Benjamin X, known as a highly able speaker himself. ""Brother, will you speak?"" she asked -- then, turning to Malcolm X, ""Is it all right if he speaks? And maybe he could introduce you."" Malcolm X abruptly whirled on her, and barked, ""You know you shouldn't ask me right in front of him!"" Then, collecting himself quickly, he said ""Okay,"" Brother Benjamin X asked how long he should speak. Malcolm X said, glancing again at his wristwatch, ""Make it half an hour."" And Brother Benjamin X went through the door leading onto the stage. They heard him expertly exhorting the audience about what is needed today by ""the black man here in these United States.""

The Reverend Galamison and other notables due hadn't arrived by three o'clock. ""Brother Malcolm looked so disappointed,"" the young lady says. ""He said to me `I don't think any of them are coming, either.' I felt so terrible for him. It did seem as if no one cared. I told him `Oh, don't worry, they're just late, they'll be here.'"" (It was also reported by another source that Galamison, unable to come to the meeting, did telephone earlier, and that Malcolm X was told of this before he went out to speak.)

Then Brother Benjamin X's half-hour was up, and the young lady and Malcolm X, alone back there in the anteroom, could hear him entering the introduction: ""And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you, a man who would give his life for you -- I want you to hear, listen, to understand -- one who is a trojan for the black man!""

Applause rose from the audience; at the anteroom door, Malcolm X turned and looked back at his young lady assistant. ""You'll have to forgive me for raising my voice to you -- I'm just about at my wit's end.""

""Oh, don't mention it!"" she said quickly, ""I understand.""

His voice sounded far away, ""I wonder if anybody really understands -- "" And he walked out onto the stage, into the applause, smiling and nodding at Brother Benjamin X who passed him en route to the anteroom.

The young lady had picked up some paperwork she had to do when Benjamin X came in, perspiring. She patted his hand, saying, ""That was good!"" Through the anteroom door, just ajar, she and Benjamin X heard the applause diminishing, then the familiar ringing greeting, ""Asalaikum, brothers and sisters!""

""Asalaikum salaam!"" some in the audience responded.

About eight rows of seats from the front, then, a disturbance occurred. In a sudden scuffling, a man's voice was raised angrily, ""Take your hand out of my pocket!"" The entire audience was swiveling to look. ""Hold it! Hold it! Don't get excited,"" Malcolm X said crisply, ""Let's cool it, brothers -- ""

With his own attention distracted, it is possible that he never saw the gunmen. One woman who was seated near the front says. ""The commotion back there diverted me just for an instant, then I turned back to look at Malcolm X just in time to see at least three men in the front row stand and take aim and start firing simultaneously. It looked like a firing squad."" Numerous persons later said they saw two men rushing toward the stage, one with a shotgun, the other with two revolvers. Said U.P.I. reporter Stanley Scott: ""Shots rang out. Men, women and children ran for cover. They stretched out on the floor and ducked under tables."" Radio Station WMCA reporter Hugh Simpson said, ""Then I heard this muffled sound, I saw Malcolm hit with his hands still raised, then he fell back over the chairs behind him. Everybody was shouting. I saw one man firing a gun from under his coat behind me as I hit it [the floor], too. He was firing like he was in some Western, running backward toward the door and firing at the same time.""

The young lady who was in the backstage anteroom told me, ""It sounded like an army had taken over. Somehow, I knew. I wouldn't go and look. I wanted to remember him as he was.""

Malcolm X's hand flew to his chest as the first of sixteen shotgun pellets or revolver slugs hit him. Then the other hand flew up. The middle finger of the left hand was bullet-shattered, and blood gushed from his goatee. He clutched his chest. His big body suddenly fell back stiffly, knocking over two chairs; his head struck the stage floor with a thud.

In the bedlam of shouting, screaming, running people, some ran toward the stage. Among them Sister Betty scrambled up from where she had thrown her body over her children, who were shrieking; she ran crying hysterically, ""My husband! They're killing my husband!"" An unidentified photographer snapped shots of Malcolm X supine on the stage floor with people bent over him snatching apart his bloody shirt, loosening his tie, trying to give him mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration, first a woman, then a man. Said the woman, who identified herself only as a registered nurse, ""I don't know how I got up on the stage, but I threw myself down on who I thought was Malcolm -- but it wasn't. I was willing to die for the man, I would have taken the bullets myself; then I saw Malcolm, and the firing had stopped, and I tried to give him artificial respiration."" Then Sister Betty came through the people, herself a nurse, and people recognizing her moved back; she fell on her knees looking down on his bare, bullet-pocked chest, sobbing, ""They killed him!""

Patrolman Thomas Hoy, 22, was stationed outside the Audubon Ballroom entrance. ""I heard the shooting and the place exploded.""

He rushed inside, he saw Malcolm X lying on the stage, and then some people chasing a man. Patrolman Hoy ""grabbed the suspect.""

Louis Michaux, the owner of the Nationalist Memorial Bookstore at 125th Street and Seventh Avenue in Harlem, said, ""I was arriving late at the meeting where Malcolm X had invited me, I met a large number of people rushing out.""

Sergeant Alvin Aronoff and Patrolman Louis Angelos happened to be cruising by in their radio car when they heard shots. ""When we got there,"" said Aronoff, ""the crowds were pushing out and screaming `Malcolm's been shot!' and `Get 'im, get 'im, don't let him go!'"" The two policemen grabbed by the arms a Negro who was being kicked as he tried to escape. Firing a warning shot into the air, the policemen pushed the man into their police car, not wanting the angry crowd to close in, and drove him quickly to the police station.

Someone had run up to the Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital's Vanderbilt Clinic emergency entrance at 167th Street and grabbed a poles-and-canvas stretcher and brought it back to the Audubon Ballroom stage. Malcolm X was put on the stretcher and an unidentified photographer got a macabre picture of him, with his mouth open and his teeth bared, as men rushed him up to the hospital clinic emergency entrance. A hospital spokesman said later that it was about 3:15 P.M. when Malcolm X reached a third-floor operating room. He was ""either dead, or in a death-appearing state,"" said the spokesman.

A team of surgeons cut through his chest to attempt to massage the heart. The effort was abandoned at 3:30 P.M.

Reporters who had descended upon the hospital office fired questions at the spokesman, who kept saying brusquely, ""I don't know."" Then he took the elevator upstairs to the emergency operating room. A small crowd of friends and Sister Betty had also pushed into the hospital office when the hospital spokesman returned. Collecting himself, he made an announcement: ""The gentleman you know as Malcolm X is dead. He died from gunshot wounds. He was apparently dead before he got here. He was shot in the chest several times, and once in the cheek.""

The group filed out of the hospital office. The Negro men were visibly fighting their emotions; one kept smashing his fist into the other cupped palm. Among the women, many were openly crying.

Moments after the news flashed throughout Harlem (and throughout the entire world), a crowd began to gather outside the Hotel Theresa where Malcolm X's OAAU had its headquarters. They learned over transistor radios that the man whom the two policemen had taken from the murder scene initially identified himself as Thomas Hagan, 22 (he was later identified as Talmadge Hayer), in whose right trousers pocket the policemen had found a .45 caliber cartridge clip containing four unused cartridges, and then at Jewish Memorial Hospital doctors had reported that Hayer had been shot in the left thigh, his forehead was bruised and his body was beaten. ""If we hadn't gotten him away, they would have kicked him to death,"" Sergeant Aronoff had said, and Hayer had been taken to the Bellevue Hospital Prison Ward.

By five P.M., the crowd in front of the Theresa Hotel had been quietly, carefully dispersed, and the Black Muslim Mosque Number 7 and its restaurant around the corner, at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, had been ordered closed as a precautionary measure, on the orders of the local 28th Precinct's Captain Lloyd Sealy. New York City's first Negro to command a precinct. When reporters telephoned the Black Muslim restaurant, a man's voice stated, ""No one is available to make any statement."" When the OAAU office in the Theresa Hotel was tried, the telephone kept ringing, unanswered. Precinct Captain Sealy soon appeared, walking by himself along 125th Street, swinging his nightstick and conversing with people he met.

At the 28th Precinct station house on West 123rd Street, the forty policemen who were to have gone off duty at four P.M. had been told they must remain on duty, and two full busloads of the highly trained New York City Police Tactical Patrol Force had arrived at the precinct. Various high police officials made press statements. A Tactical Patrol Force Captain, Harry Kaiser, said no unusual occurrences had been noted, and he anticipated no trouble. Deputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm said that hundreds"" of extra policemen would be put into the Harlem area, including some members of the Bureau of Special Services. An Assistant Chief Inspector, Harry Taylor, speculated that the assassins had not rushed from the ballroom among the crowd, but had kept running past the stage and escaped on 165th Street. In the early evening, the police department's Chief of Detectives Philip J. Walsh quit a vacation he was on to join the hunt for the killers, and he said he looked forward to ""a long-drawn-out investigation."" Police and reporters at the shooting scene had pictures taken of the stage, with white chalk marks now circling five bullet holes in the speaker's stand; there were other holes in the stage's mural backdrop, indicating slugs or shotgun pellets which had either missed Malcolm X or passed through him. Police declined to discuss a rumor sweeping Harlem that they had some motion pictures which had been taken in the Audubon Ballroom as the murder took place. Another rumor that gained swift momentum was that when Sister Betty had leaned over her husband's body, she had removed from his coat pocket a paper on which he had written the names of those he had supposedly learned were assigned to execute him.

Deputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm stressed that the department had made efforts to protect Malcolm X. Twenty different times the department had offered protection to Malcolm X or to some of his assistants, and the protection was refused, said Commissioner Arm, and seventeen times uniformed police guards had been offered for the OAAU meetings at the Audubon Ballroom, the most recent time being ""last Sunday."" Asked about the pistol permit that Malcolm X had said publicly he planned to request, Commissioner Arm said that as far as he knew, Malcolm X had never actually filed a request.

A number of questions have been raised. The ""suspect"" arrested by Patrolman Hoy as he was being chased from the meeting has, at present writing, not been identified publicly. Deputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm's statement that Malcolm X refused police protection conflicts directly with the statements of many of his associates that during the week preceding his assassination Malcolm X complained repeatedly that the police would not take his requests for protection seriously. Finally, although police sources said that a special detail of twenty men had been assigned to the meeting and that it had even been attended by agents of the Bureau of Special Services, these men were nowhere in evidence during or after the assassination, and Talmadge Hayer, rescued from the crowd and arrested as a suspect immediately after the assassination, was picked up by two patrolmen in a squad car cruising by.

On long-distance telephones, reporters reached the Chicago mansion headquarters of Elijah Muhammad. He would not come to the telephone, but a spokesman of his said that Muhammad ""has no comment today, but he might have something to say tomorrow."" No statement could be obtained either from Malcolm X's oldest brother, Wilfred X, the Black Muslim minister of Mosque Number 1 in Detroit. At his home, a woman told reporters that Minister Wilfred X was not there, that he had not gone to New York, and she didn't believe he had any plans to do so. (Minister Wilfred X, reached later, said that he anticipated attending the Black Muslim convention in Chicago on the following Sunday, and regarding his brother, ""My brother is dead and there is nothing we can do to bring him back."")

As dark fell, many Negro men and women assembled before Louis Michaux's bookstore, where most of Harlem's Black Nationalist public activity centered. A small group of OAAU members opened their Hotel Theresa headquarters and sat in the room and would not make any statements to reporters.

The New York Daily News came onto the newsstands with its cover page devoted to ""Malcolm X Murdered"" over the photograph of him being borne away on the stretcher, and a subcaption, ""Gunned Down at Rally."" In Long Island, where she had been taken just after her father's murder, six-year-old Attallah carefully wrote a letter to him, ""Dear Daddy, I love you so. O dear, O dear, I wish you wasn't dead.""


The body -- still listed as ""John Doe"" because it had not yet been formally identified -- had been moved late Sunday to the New York City Medical Examiner's office at 520 First Avenue. The autopsy confirmed that shotgun pellet wounds in the heart had killed Malcolm X. Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Milton Helpern said that death followed the first sawed-off shotgun blast which caused thirteen wounds in the heart and chest, and he said that .38 and .45 caliber bullet wounds in the thighs and legs evidenced that Malcolm X had been shot at after he had fallen.

Monday morning the official identification was made at the Medical Examiner's office by Sister Betty, who was accompanied by Percy Sutton, Malcolm X's Boston half-sister Mrs. Ella Collins, and Joseph E. Hall, General Manager of the large Unity Funeral Home in Harlem. Leaving the Medical Examiner's office at about noon to go and complete funeral arrangements, Sister Betty told reporters, ""No one believed what he said. They never took him seriously, even after the bombing of our home they said he did it himself!""

At the Unity Funeral Home on the east side of Eighth Avenue between 126th and 127th streets, Sister Betty chose a six-foot-nine-inch bronze casket lined with egg-shell velvet. At her request, the funeral would be delayed until the following Saturday, five days away. The funeral home's manager Hall announced to the press that the body would be dressed in a business suit, and it would be put on view under a glass shield from Tuesday through Friday, then the Saturday services would be at a Harlem church.

Soon posted on the funeral home's directory was ""El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz."" In Brooklyn, orthodox Moslem Sheik Al-Hajh Daoud Ahmed Faisal of the Islamic Mission of America said that the delayed funeral services violated a Moslem practice that the sun should not set twice on a believer's body, that the Koran prescribed burial inside twenty-four hours if possible, and Moslems believed that when a body grows cold the soul leaves it and when the body is put into the earth it comes alive again.

In Chicago, where policemen were watching all bus depots, railways, terminals, O'Hare Airport and highway entrances, Elijah Muhammad, under heavy guard in his three-story mansion, said, ""Malcolm died according to his preaching. He seems to have taken weapons as his god. Therefore, we couldn't tolerate a man like that. He preached war. We preach peace. We are permitted to fight if we are attacked -- that's the Scripture, the Koran, and the Bible, too. But we will never be the aggressor. I don't have the right to be frightened, because I was chosen by Allah. If Allah gives me up to the hands of the wicked, I am satisfied. My life is in the hands of Allah."" The grounds outside the mansion were patrolled by both Chicago police and Fruit of Islam bodyguards. More of both patrolled before the University of Islam high school, and the offices of the newspaper Muhammad Speaks.

Malcolm X's lawyer, Assemblyman Percy Sutton, said that the police now had the names of those whom Malcolm X had said planned to kill him. All over Harlem, reporters were interviewing people, and microphones were being put before the mouths of the man-in-the-street. At police precinct station houses, people being questioned were leaving by side entrances. Said Assistant Chief Inspector Joseph Coyle, in charge of Manhattan North detectives, "". . . . a well-planned conspiracy. We're doing a screening process of the four hundred people who were in the hall at the time."" Fifty detectives were on the case, he said, and he had been in touch with police in other cities.

Harlem was mostly asleep when around the Black Muslim Mosque Number 7, on the top floor of a four-story building at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, an explosive sound at 2:15 A.M. ripped the night. Firemen were instantly summoned by the four policemen who had been guarding the sidewalk entrance to the mosque. Within a few minutes flames burst through the building's roof and leaped thirty feet into the air. For the next seven hours firemen would pour water into the building. On an adjacent roof they found an empty five-gallon gasoline can, a brown, gasoline-stained shopping bag, and oily rags. Southbound IRT subway service was re-routed for a while, also three bus lines. At the spectacular five-alarm fire's height, a wall of the building collapsed; it smashed two fire engines at the curb and injured five firemen, one seriously, and also a pedestrian who had been across the street buying a newspaper. By daybreak, when the fire was declared ""under control,"" the Black Muslim mosque and the Gethsemane Church of God in Christ on the floor beneath it were gutted, and seven street-level stores, including the Black Muslim restaurant, were ""total losses."" Fire Department sources said that replacing the ruined equipment would cost ""around $50,000."" Joseph X of the Black Muslims, who once had been the immediate assistant of Malcolm X, said that Elijah Muhammad's followers had two alternative mosques to meet in, one in Brooklyn and the other in Queens, Long Island. Both these mosques were under continuous police guard.

Across the nation in San Francisco on Tuesday afternoon two policemen discovered a fire beginning in the San Francisco Black Muslim Mosque, and quickly extinguished it. Kerosene had been splashed on the sidewalk and door and set afire.

The body of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz originally had been scheduled to go on public view at 2:30 P.M. Tuesday. Crowds stood in line behind police barricades waiting to be admitted and the policemen wherever one looked included numerous patrol cars and even sharpshooters on the roofs around the Unity Funeral Home. But the telephoned bomb threats which had begun shortly after noon made necessary two evacuations of the funeral home for bomb-squad searches, which proved futile. A search was conducted even in the 43rd Street offices of the New York Times after a man telephoned complaining of an editorial about Malcolm X and said, ""Your plant will be destroyed at four o'clock.""

At the funeral home in Harlem, policemen inspected all packages and floral pieces being delivered, as well as the large handbags of women mourners. It was 6:15 P.M. when a cordon of policemen arrived flanking Sister Betty and four close relatives and friends who entered the funeral home in a glare of flashbulbs. ""She's a black Jacqueline Kennedy,"" observed a white reporter. ""She has class, she knows what to do and when, she handles herself beautifully.""

It was 7:10 P.M. when the family party emerged and left. After ten minutes, the first of the waiting public was admitted. Between then and an hour before midnight, two thousand people, including scores of whites, had filed past the open coffin in which the body lay dressed in a dark business suit, a white shirt and dark tie, with a small, oblong brass plate above it inscribed, ""El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz -- May 19, 1925 -- Feb. 21, 1965.""


Malcolm X followers had been canvassing with growing anxiety for a Harlem church that would accept the Saturday funeral. Officials of several churches had refused, including a spokesman for the community's largest church, Abyssinian Baptist, of which Congressman-Reverend Adam Clayton Powell is the pastor; others which turned down requests, according to the Amsterdam News, included the Williams C.M.E. Church and The Refuge Temple of The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Then the funeral was accepted by Bishop Alvin A. Childs for the Faith Temple, Church of God in Christ located at 147th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. The Faith Temple, a former movie theater which had been converted fifteen years previously, could seat a thousand in its auditorium and another seven hundred in its basement. Bishop Childs, who in 1964 had been elected as Harlem's ""locality mayor,"" told the press that it was ""as a humanitarian gesture"" that he made his church available, and of Malcolm X, he said, "". . . a militant and vocal person. I did not agree with all of his philosophy, but this did not affect our friendship."" Shortly after the news became known, Bishop Childs and his wife began to receive the first of a succession of bomb threats telephoned both to the church and to their home.

Prominent Negro figures were being quoted by the various press media. The famed psychologist Dr. Kenneth B. Clark told Jet magazine, ""I had a deep respect for this man. I believe that he was sincerely groping to find a place in the fight for Civil Rights, on a level where he would be respected and understood fully. I looked forward to his growth along those lines. It doesn't matter so much about his past. It is tragic that he was cut down at the point when he seemed on the verge of achieving the position of respectability he sought."" A New York Times correspondent in a London press conference quoted the author and dramatist James Baldwin, who thought the death of Malcolm X was ""a major setback for the Negro movement."" Pointing at white reporters, Baldwin accused, ""You did it . . . whoever did it was formed in the crucible of the Western world, of the American Republic!"" European ""rape"" of Africa began racial problems and was therefore the beginning of the end for Malcolm X, Baldwin said.

The bookstore owner in Harlem, Louis Michaux, a major voice in the community, told the Amsterdam News, ""It's things like the murder of Malcolm X that drive the masses closer together. He died in the same manner that Patrice Lumumba met his death in the Congo. . . . We must unite, not fight.""

""Malcolm X caused many young Negroes to take a new vision of themselves,"" said Bayard Rustin, a main figure in organizing the March on Washington in 1963. A ""third party"" was suspected of killing Malcolm X by CORE's National Director James Farmer, who said, ""Malcolm's murder was calculated to produce more violence and murder and vengeance killings."" A few days later, asked for his opinion of a rumor circulating about that a ""Red Chinese"" plot brought about the murder, Farmer said, ""I would not say it is impossible.""

""For the Negroes in America, the death of Malcolm X is the most portentous event since the deportation of Marcus Garvey in the 1920's,"" said Dr. C. Eric Lincoln, author of The Black Muslims in America, who talked to the press at Brown University in Providence, R.I., where he was a visiting professor and research fellow. ""I doubt there are `international implications' in the slaying. The answer is closer to home. The answer is in the local struggle among contending rivals for leadership of the black masses, which are potentially the most volatile sub-group in America."" Said Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, ""Master spellbinder that he was, Malcolm X in death cast a spell more far-flung and more disturbing than any he cast in life.""

The New York City police investigators who were pursuing the case were unhappy that Malcolm's followers had ""not come forward"" to aid the investigation. At police request, the press printed a telephone number, SW 5-8117, for ""strictly confidential"" information that anyone might offer concerning the slaying. The police had picked up and were holding Reuben Francis, described as a Malcolm X ""bodyguard,"" who was believed to be the person who had shot the suspected assassin Talmadge Hayer during the melee the previous Sunday at the Audubon Ballroom. Hayer remained in the Bellevue Prison Ward, awaiting surgery.

As thousands continued viewing the body of the slain Malcolm X amid intermittent new bomb threats telephoned to the funeral home, and to the Faith Temple where his funeral was scheduled for Saturday, a new organization, the Federation of Independent Political Action, threatened to picket all Harlem business establishments which would not close from Thursday afternoon until Monday morning ""in tribute to Malcolm X."" The FIPA's spokesman was Jesse Gray, the well-known rent-strike leader; Harlem pedestrians began to be handed printed sheets reading, in part, ""If the stores refuse to close, they identify with our enemy -- therefore we must close them -- pass them by. Those that shop along 125th Street during the hours that the stores are to be closed identify with the murderous stooge that allowed the power structure to use his hands to kill Brother Malcolm."" At a late evening FIPA rally before Louis Michaux's bookstore, Jesse Gray declared that in 1965 a Negro should run for Mayor of New York ""in the name of Malcolm,"" and speculated that such a candidate should receive 100,000 votes. Shortly after the FIPA rally, merchants and other members of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce met and swiftly passed a resolution urging all Harlem stores to remain open and ""continue to serve their customers,"" and recommendation was made that full pay be given to any store employees who might wish to attend Malcolm X's funeral on Saturday morning. Then one after another, Harlem leaders sharply criticized the FIPA proposal as ""irresponsible."" Finally, nearly all of the Harlem stores kept their doors open for business. The FIPA got together about twenty pickets who patrolled for a while before Harlem's largest store, Blumstein's; leading the pickets were two white men carrying signs reading ""All Stores Should Close. Honor Malcolm X.""

The weather had turned very cold. Icicles hung from the collapsed roof of the fire-ruined building that had housed Black Muslim Mosque Number 7. The Amsterdam News, its offices barely a block down Eighth Avenue from the funeral home where Malcolm X's body lay, editorialized, ""Steady, Eddie!"" saying that orderly tributes to Malcolm X would ""confound his critics, who would like nothing better than to see black people rioting over his remains.""

The fear of serious mass rioting set off by some unpredictable spark hung steadily in the air. An increasing number of Harlem leaders declared that the principal reason for this was the downtown white press media, sensationalizing what was going on in a calm, dignified community. Finally the Harlem Ministers' Interfaith Association would issue a formal accusation: ""The screaming headlines of many of our newspapers make it seem as if all of Harlem was an armed camp, ready to explode at any moment. The vast majority of the citizens of the Harlem community is not involved in the unfortunate acts of violence that have been grossly overplayed by the press. Many times the slanting of the news is able to bring about an atmosphere through which a few depraved and reckless individuals can take advantage.""

""Malcolm X Died Broke"" -- that headline in Harlem's Amsterdam News came as a shock to many in the community. Few had reflected that Malcolm X, upon becoming a Black Muslim minister, had signed an oath of poverty, so that for twelve years he never acquired anything in his own name. (Somewhere I have read that Malcolm X in his Black Muslim days received about $175 weekly to cover his living and other expenses exclusive of travel.) ""He left his four daughters and pregnant wife with no insurance of any kind, no savings, and no income,"" the Amsterdam News story said (and it might have added that he never drew up a will; he had made a February 26th appointment with his lawyer -- five days after his death). Within the week, two groups had organized and were asking Harlemites for contributions to help Sister Betty raise and educate the children (since organized as the Malcolm X Daughters' Fund at Harlem's Freedom National Bank, 275 West 125th Street).

In Boston, Malcolm X's half-sister, Mrs. Ella Mae Collins, told a news conference that she would choose the leaders of the OAAU to succeed Malcolm X. Mrs. Collins operated the Sarah A. Little School of Preparatory Arts where, she said, children were taught Arabic, Swahili, French, and Spanish. In 1959, she, too, had broken away from Elijah Muhammad's Black Muslims, to which she had originally been converted by Malcolm X.

Far from Harlem, in lands where Malcolm X had traveled, the press had given the murder a coverage that had highly irritated the Director of the United States Information Agency, Carl T. Rowan, himself a Negro. In Washington, addressing the American Foreign Service Association, Rowan said that when he first heard of the murder, he knew it would be grossly misconstrued in some countries where people were unaware what Malcolm X represented, and he said the USIA had worked hard to inform the African press of the facts about Malcolm X and his preachments, but still there had been ""a host of African reaction based on misinformation and misrepresentation.""

Said USIA Director Rowan, ""Mind you, here was a Negro who preached segregation and race hatred, killed by another Negro, presumably from another organization that preaches segregation and race hatred, and neither of them representative of more than a tiny minority of the Negro population of America -- "" Rowan held up some foreign newspapers. ""All this about an exconvict, ex-dope peddler who became a racial fanatic,"" continued Rowan. ""I can only conclude that we Americans know less about what goes on in the minds of other peoples than we thought, or the need to inform is even greater than we in USIA thought it to be.""

The Daily Times of Lagos, in Nigeria, had said: ""Like all mortals, Malcolm X was not without his faults . . . but that he was a dedicated and consistent disciple of the movement for the emancipation of his brethren, no one can doubt . . . Malcolm X has fought and died for what he believed to be right. He will have a place in the palace of martyrs."" The Ghanaian Times, Accra, called Malcolm X ""the militant and most popular of Afro-American anti-segregationist leaders"" and it added his name to ""a host of Africans and Americans"" ranging from John Brown to Patrice Lumumba ""who were martyred in freedom's cause."" Also in Accra, the Daily Graphic: ""The assassination of Malcolm X will go down in history as the greatest blow the American integrationist movement has suffered since the shocking assassinations of Medgar Evers and John F. Kennedy.""

The Pakistan Hurriyet of Karachi said: ""A great Negro leader""; the Pakistan Times said, ""His death is a definite setback to the Negro movement for emancipation."" The Peking, China People's Daily said the killing happened ""because Malcolm X . . . fought for the emancipation of the 23,000,000 American Negroes."" According to correspondents' reports, the first Algerian headline said ""the Ku Klux Klan"" assassinated Malcolm X; the pro-Communist Alger Republican's editorial on the slaying accused ""American Fascism,"" and the Times' Algerian correspondent said Algerians showed ""signs"" of raising Malcolm X to martyrdom. The U.S. Consulate in Georgetown, British Guiana, was marched on by pickets accusing ""American imperialists."" Another Peking, China paper, Jenmin Jihpao, said that the death showed that ""in dealing with imperialist oppressors, violence must be met with violence."" Pravda in Moscow carried only brief stories and no editorial comment, the New York Times Moscow correspondent said, and another in Poland said there was no noticeable reaction of any kind, and that ""few Poles had heard of Malcolm or were interested in the racial issue."" Reportedly, the murder was only routinely reported with little special interest by the press in Cairo, Beirut, New Delhi, and Saigon. In Paris and Western Europe, the story was ""essentially a one-day sensation,"" with the West German press handling it ""as if it were in the Chicago gangster tradition."" The New York Times said: ""The London newspapers have probably played the story harder and longer than most, giving continuing emphasis to the police work on the murder. The London Times and the London Daily Telegraph both carried editorial comments, but neither treated Malcolm X as a major figure."" Also reported by the New York Times London correspondent was that ""a London group calling itself the Council of African Organizations had violently attacked the United States over the murder. This group is made up of students and other unofficial African representatives here. A press release described Malcolm as a `leader in the struggle against American imperialism, oppression and racialism.' It said, `the butchers of Patrice Lumumba are the very same monsters who have murdered Malcolm X in cold blood.'""

Friday morning New York City press headlines concerning Malcolm X's slaying were devoted to the police department's apprehension of a second slaying suspect. He was a stocky, round-faced, twenty-six-year-old karate expert named Norman 3X Butler, allegedly a Black Muslim, and a week later, this was followed by the arrest of Thomas 15X Johnson, also allegedly a Black Muslim. Both men had been earlier indicted in the January, 1965, shooting of Benjamin Brown, a New York City Correction Officer and a Black Muslim defector. Both men were indicted, along with Hayer, for the murder of Malcolm X on March 10.

With the news announcement of Butler's arrest, and his at least tentative identification as a member of Elijah Muhammad's organization, tension reached a new high among all who had any role in the feud. The Black Muslim National Convention was scheduled to begin that Friday in Chicago, to last for three days. Early Friday morning in New York at the Kennedy Airport dozens of policemen spent forty minutes searching a plane belonging to Capital Airlines, which back in December 1964 had accepted a Mosque Number 7 charter flight to Chicago and return, at a fee of $5,175.54 which the mosque had subsequently paid in increments.

Altogether, about three thousand Black Muslims from their mosques in most sizable cities were in Chicago for their annual ""Saviour's Day"" convention, regarded by them as similar to the holiday of Christmas. In the order of arrival, each group from the different mosques and cities assembled outside the big sports coliseum south of Chicago's business district, the brothers of all ages dressed in neat, dark suits and white shirts and the sisters garbed in flowing silk gowns and headdresses -- and every individual was filtered through an intense security check that Chicago police sources said was unprecedented in Chicago except for a visiting President.

Searched even more closely were the relatively few non-Muslim Negroes who came to be spectators, and the press representatives both white and black. ""Take off your hat, show some respect!"" snapped a Black Muslim guard at a white reporter. As each person was ""cleared"" a Fruit of Islam man ushered him or her to a specific seat in the drafty interior of the 7500-seat coliseum. (Later, Muslim sources would blame the half-full house upon ""the white man's dividing of Negroes,"" but observers who recalled the packed coliseum in 1964 said that bombing fears kept away many non-Muslim Negroes.) The audience sat lightly murmuring under the two huge hanging banners proclaiming ""Welcome Elijah Muhammad -- We Are Glad To Have You With Us"" and ""We Must Have Some Of This Land"" (referring to Elijah Muhammad's demand that ""one or more states"" be turned over to the ""23 million so-called Negroes"" in America as partial reparation for ""over a century of our free blood and sweat as slaves which helped to develop this wealthy nation where still today you show us you do not wish or intend to accept us as equals""). In front of the wide, raised speaker's platform were two nearly life-sized photographic blowups of Elijah Muhammad. Standing between the stage and the audience were Fruit of Islam guards. Others were prowling the aisles, scanning rows of faces, with intermittent peremptory demands for identification, ""What mosque, brother?"" Still more Fruit of Islam men were inspecting the coliseum's vacant balcony, backstage, downstairs, and rafters and roof.

The ghost of Malcolm X was in the coliseum. First, in a high drama for the Muslims, Elijah Muhammad's son, Wallace Delaney Muhammad, who once had sided with Malcolm X, faced the audience and begged forgiveness for his defection. Next, two brothers of Malcolm X, Wilfred and Philbert, both of them Black Muslim ministers, urged unity with Elijah Muhammad. Said Minister Wilfred X of the Detroit mosque, ""We would be ignorant to get confused and go to arguing and fighting among ourselves and forget who the real enemy is."" Said Minister Philbert X, of the Lansing mosque, ""Malcolm was my own blood brother, next to me . . . I was shocked. No man wants to see his own brother destroyed. But I knew that he was traveling on a very reckless and dangerous road. I made attempts to change his course. When he was living, I tried to keep him living; now that he is dead, there is nothing I can do."" Indicating the seated Elijah Muhammad, Minister Philbert X declared, ""Where he leads me, I will follow"" -- and then he introduced the Black Muslim leader to make his address.

Only the head of Elijah Muhammad was visible above the grim-faced Fruit of Islam men in a living wall, Cassius Clay among them. Crescents, stars, moons and suns were in gold thread embroidery on the small fez that Elijah Muhammad wore. He said in his speech: ""For a long time, Malcolm stood here where I stand. In those days, Malcolm was safe, Malcolm was loved. God, Himself, protected Malcolm. . . . For more than a year, Malcolm was given his freedom. He went everywhere -- Asia, Europe, Africa, even to Mecca, trying to make enemies for me. He came back preaching that we should not hate the enemy. . . . He came here a few weeks ago to blast away his hate and mudslinging; everything he could think of to disgrace me. . . . We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him. They know I didn't harm Malcolm. They know I loved him. His foolish teaching brought him to his own end. . . . ""

Both physically and emotionally worked up, often Elijah Muhammad would begin coughing. ""Take it easy! Take your time!"" his audience pleaded with him. ""He had no right to reject me!"" Elijah Muhammad declared. ""He was a star, who went astray! . . . They knew I didn't harm Malcolm, but he tried to make war against me."" He said that Malcolm X would have been given ""the most glorious of burials"" if he had stayed with the Black Muslims and had died a natural death; ""instead, we stand beside the grave of a hypocrite! . . . Malcolm! Who was he leading? Who was he teaching? He has no truth! We didn't want to kill Malcolm! His foolish teaching would bring him to his own end! I am not going to let the crackpots destroy the good things Allah sent to you and me!""

Elijah Muhammad drove his frail energy to speak for about an hour and a half. He challenged any would-be assassins: ""If you seek to snuff out the life of Elijah Muhammad, you are inviting your own doom! The Holy Quran tells us not to pick a fight but to defend ourselves. We will fight!"" It was mid-afternoon when Elijah Muhammad turned back to his seat with some three thousand Black Muslim men, women, and children shouting ""Yes, sir! . . . So sweet! . . . All praise to Muhammad!""

In the Unity Funeral Home in the Harlem community of New York City in the mid-afternoon, the public's viewing of the body of Malcolm X was interrupted by the arrival of a party of about a dozen people whose central figure was a white-turbaned, darkrobed elderly man whose white beard fell to his chest and who carried a forked stick. When reporters rushed to attempt interviews, another man in the party waved them away, saying, ""A silent tongue does not betray its owner."" The man was Sheik Ahmed Hassoun, a Sudanese, a member of the Sunni Moslems, who had taught in Mecca for thirty-five years when he had met Malcolm X there, and then had soon come to the United States to serve as Malcolm X's spiritual advisor and to teach at the Muslim Mosque, Inc.

Sheik Hassoun prepared the body for burial in accordance with Moslem ritual. Removing the Western clothing in which the body had been on display, Sheik Hassoun washed the body with special holy oil. Then he draped the body in the traditional seven white linen shrouds, called the kafan. Only the face with its reddish mustache and goatee was left exposed. The mourners who had come with Sheik Hassoun filed to the bier and he read passages from the Koran. Then he turned to a funeral home representative: ""Now the body is ready for burial."" Soon, the sheik and his retinue left, and the viewing by the public resumed. When the word spread, numbers of persons who had come before returned for another wait in the long, slowly moving line, wanting to see the Moslem burial dress.

It was late during this Friday afternoon that I got into the quietly moving line, thinking about the Malcolm X with whom I had worked closely for about two years. Blue-uniformed policemen stood at intervals watching us shuffle along within the wooden gray-painted police barricades. Just across the street several men were looking at the line from behind a large side window of the ""Lone Star Barber Shop, Eddie Johns, Prop., William Ashe, Mgr."" Among the policemen were a few press representatives talking to each other to pass the time. Then we were inside the softly lit, hushed, cool, large chapel. Standing at either end of the long, handsome bronze coffin were two big, dark policemen, mostly looking straight ahead, but moving their lips when some viewer tarried. Within minutes I had reached the coffin. Under the glass lid, I glimpsed the delicate white shrouding over the chest and up like a hood about the face on which I tried to concentrate for as long as I could. All I could think was that it was he, all right -- Malcolm X. ""Move on"" -- the policeman's voice was soft. Malcolm looked to me -- just waxy and dead. The policeman's hand was gesturing at his waist level. I thought, ""Well -- good-bye."" I moved on.

Twenty-two thousand people had viewed the body when the line was stopped that night for good, at eleven P.M. Quietly, between midnight and dawn, a dozen police cars flanked a hearse that went the twenty-odd blocks farther uptown to the Faith Temple. The bronze coffin was wheeled inside and placed upon a platform draped in thick dark red velvet, in front of the altar, and the coffin's lid was reopened. As the hearse pulled away, policemen stood at posts of vigil both inside and outside Faith Temple. It was crispy cold outside.

About six A.M., people began forming a line on the east side of Amsterdam Avenue. By nine A.M., an estimated six thousand persons thronged the nearby blocks, behind police barriers, and faces were in every window of the apartment buildings across the street; some stood shivering on fire escapes. From 145th Street to 149th Street, policemen had blocked off all automobile traffic except for their own cars, the newspapers' cars, and the equipment trucks for radio and television on-the-spot coverage. There were hundreds of policemen, some on the rooftops in the immediate area. Combing the crowd's edges were reporters with microphones and notebooks. ""He was fascinating, a remarkably fascinating man, that's why I'm here,"" a white girl in her midtwenties told a New York Times man; and a Negro woman, ""I'm paying my respects to the greatest black man in this century. He's a black man. Don't say colored."" Another woman, noticing steel helmets inside a television network car, laughed to the driver, ""You getting ready for next summer?""

When the Faith Temple doors were opened at 9:20, a corps of OAAU members entered. Within the next quarter-hour, twenty of the men had ushered in six hundred seat-holders. Fifty press reporters, photographers and television cameramen clustered beneath religious murals to the rear of the altar, and some stood on chairs to see better. A Negro engineer monitored recording equipment between the altar and the coffin which was guarded by eight uniformed Negro policemen and two uniformed Negro policewomen. One Negro plainclothes policeman sat on either side of heavily veiled Sister Betty in the second row. The raised lid of the coffin hid the Faith Temple's brass tithe box and candelabra; the head of the Islamic Mission of America, in Brooklyn, Sheik Al-Haj Daoud Ahmed Faisal, had counseled that any hint of Christianity in the services would make the deceased a kafir, an unbeliever. (The sheik had also dissented with the days of public exhibition of the body: ""Death is a private matter between Allah and the deceased."")

Before the services began, OAAU ushers brought in one floral wreath -- a two-by-five arrangement of the Islamic Star and Crescent in white carnations against a background of red carnations.

First, the actor Ossie Davis and his wife, actress Ruby Dee, read the notes, telegrams and cables of condolence. They came from every major civil rights organization; from individual figures such as Dr. Martin Luther King; from organizations and governments abroad, such as The Africa-Pakistan-West-Indian Society of the London School of Economics, the Pan-African Congress of Southern Africa, the Nigerian Ambassador from Lagos, the President of the Republic of Ghana, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah: ""The death of Malcolm X shall not have been in vain.""

Next, Omar Osman stood, a representative of the Islam Center of Switzerland and the United States: ""We knew Brother Malcolm as a blood brother, particularly after his pilgrimage to Mecca last year. The highest thing that a Moslem can aspire to is to die on the battlefield and not die at his bedside --"" He paused briefly to wait out the applause from among the mourners. ""Those who die on the battlefield are not dead, but are alive!"" The applause was louder, and cries rose, ""Right! Right!"" Omar Osman then critically commented upon the remarks which USIA Director Carl Rowan had made in Washington, D.C., about the foreign press reaction to the death of the deceased. From the audience then hisses rose.

Again, the actor Ossie Davis stood. His deep voice delivered the eulogy to Malcolm X which was going to cause Davis subsequently to be hailed more than ever among Negroes in Harlem:

""Here -- at this final hour, in this quiet place, Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its brightest hopes -- extinguished now, and gone from us forever. . . .

Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain -- and we will smile. . . . They will say that he is of hate -- a fanatic, a racist -- who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle!

And we will answer and say unto them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him: Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood! This was his meaning to his people. And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves. . . . And we will know him then for what he was and is -- a Prince -- our own black shining Prince! -- who didn't hesitate to die, because he loved us so.""

Brief speeches were made by others. Then, the family, the OAAU members and other Muslims present stood and filed by the coffin to view the body for the last time. Finally, the two plainclothes policemen ushered Sister Betty to have her last sight of her husband. She leaned over, kissing the glass over him; she broke into tears. Until then almost no crying had been heard in the services, but now Sister Betty's sobs were taken up by other women.

The services had lasted a little over an hour when the three minutes of prayers said for every Muslim who is dead were recited by Alhajj Heshaam Jaaber, of Elizabeth, New Jersey. At the phrase ""Allahu Akbar"" -- ""God is most great"" -- all Muslims in the audience placed their opened hands at the sides of their faces.

An official cortege, with the hearse, of three family cars, eighteen mourners' cars, twelve police cars and six press cars -- followed by about fifty other cars -- briskly drove the eighteen miles out of Manhattan and along the New York Thruway, then off its Exit 7 to reach the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, N.Y. All along the route, Negroes placed their hats or hands over their hearts, paying their final respects. At each bridge crossing to Manhattan, police cars stood watch; the Westchester County police had stationed individual patrolmen at intervals en route to the cemetery.

Over the coffin, final Moslem prayers were said by Sheik Alhajj Heshaam Jaaber. The coffin was lowered into the grave, the head facing the east, in keeping with Islamic tradition. Among the mourners, the Moslems knelt beside the grave to pray with their foreheads pressed to the earth, in the Eastern manner. When the family left the gravesite, followers of Malcolm X would not let the coffin be covered by the white gravediggers who had stood a little distance away, waiting. Instead, seven OAAU men began dropping bare handfuls of earth down on the coffin; then they were given shovels and they carried dirt to fill the grave, and then mound it.

The night fell over the earthly remains of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, who had been called Malcolm X; who had been called Malcolm Little; who had been called ""Big Red"" and ""Satan"" and ""Homeboy"" and other names -- who had been buried as a Moslem. ""According to the Koran,"" the New York Times reported, ""the bodies of the dead remain in their graves until the last Day, the Day of Judgment. On this day of cataclysm the heavens are rent and the mountains ground to dust, the graves open and men are called to account by Allah.

""The blessed -- the godfearing, the humble, the charitable, those who have suffered and been persecuted for Allah's sake or fought in religious wars for Islam -- are summoned to the Garden of Paradise.

There, according to the teaching of Mohammed, the Prophet, they live forever by flowing streams, reclining on silken cushions, and enjoying the company of dark-eyed maidens and wives of perfect purity.

The damned -- the covetous, the evildoer, the follower of gods other than Allah -- are sent to Eternal Fire, where they are fed boiling water and molten brass. `The death from which ye flee will truly overtake you,' the Koran says. `Then will ye be sent back to the Knower of things secret and open, and He will tell you the truth of the things that ye did.'""

After signing the contract for this book, Malcolm X looked at me hard. ""A writer is what I want, not an interpreter."" I tried to be a dispassionate chronicler. But he was the most electric personality I have ever met, and I still can't quite conceive him dead. It still feels to me as if he has just gone into some next chapter, to be written by historians.

CriminalBritney Spears,"[Verse 1]
He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Verse 2]
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh, I know, should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay, he's with me
And I hear people talk (People talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear, I don't care

'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright

There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

Don't Hold Your BreathNicole Scherzinger,"[Intro]
Don't hold your breath

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Verse 1]
I was under your spell for such a long time
Couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart, tore me apart
With all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had
But I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back
But no, those days are gone my friend
I loved you so much
That I thought someday that you could change
But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold your breath

[Verse 2]
I was worried about you
But you never cared about me none
You took my money and I know that you
You could kill someone
I gave you everything
But nothing was ever enough
You were always jealous over such crazy stuff

You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back

FirefliesOwl City,"[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"

Empire State Of MindJay-Z + Alicia Keys,"Yeah, yeah, I'ma up at Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere

I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the Kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry

Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboards, and I brought my boys with me

Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping mai tai
Sitting courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York
New York, New York
(I made you hot, nigga)

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my clique, though

Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip hop
Yellow Cab, Gypsy Cab, Dollar Cab, holla back
For foreigners that ain't fifty, act like they forgot how to act

Eight million stories out there, and they're naked
Cities is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I gotta plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy paying LeBron, I'm paying Dwyane Wade

Three dice, Cee-lo, three-card Monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo, I'm from the Empire State that's

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York
New York, New York

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick
The sidelines is blind with casualties
Who sipping life casually, then gradually become worse

Don't bite the apple, Eve, caught up in the in crowd
Now you're in style, end of the winter gets cold
En vogue with your skin out, the city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the cities filled with them

Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends

Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York
New York, New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on, come on)

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, let's hear it for New York

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

[Verse 2]
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
""Perfect"" couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so, I love you enough to let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you

To wrap your arms around me for real

FifteenTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"

Party In The U.S.A.Miley Cyrus,"[Verse 1]
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous

And a JAY-Z song was on

Two Is Better Than OneBoys Like Girls,"[Verse 1: Boys Like Girls]

You came into my life and I thought
Hey, you know, this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Mane""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be

I'm Mr. Mos, I'm back
Tim, are you on it?
Tim, are you on it?
Give me some
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted? Oh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm, Wayne's world
I'm the cashier, I change girls
You can go up my crane, girl
And I'ma go down that drain, girl
Hey uh, midnight cowboy
My flow is a dog, down boy
Ha, and my girl is a queen
And she do what I say and I say what I mean
Then I give it to her uncut
Shakira swing them hips like nun-chucks
Now, give it to me
I want the best and the best things in life are free

[Chorus: Shakira, Lil Wayne & Timbaland]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)

[Verse 2: Shakira]
What you get is exactly what you give
Never really know until you try
We're so ahead of this
Got this she-wolf appetite
That keeps me up all night
You know the way it works
Don't be afraid to ask
Aim high when the target is low
F-Y-I, I am ready to go
People say men are just like kids
Never saw a kid behave like this
What you give is exactly what you receive

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
So put me in a cage and lock me away
And I'll play the games that you want me to play

[Chorus: Shakira, Lil Wayne & Timbaland]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)

[Verse 3: Shakira & Lil Wayne]
Hey, can we go by walking
Or do you prefer to fly?
All of the roads are open
In your mind, in your life
Give it up to me
Hey, can we go by walking
Or do you prefer to fly?
All of the roads are open
In your life, in your life
Give it up to me

[Bridge: Shakira & Timbaland]
Hey, lil lady, what's your plan?
Say lil mama, come take a ride, jump in
Hey, there, baby, what's on your mind?
Don't need approval tonight, tonight
Give it up

[Chorus: Shakira, Lil Wayne & Timbaland]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)"
ForeverDrake,"[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane"
Live Like We're DyingKris Allen,"[Intro]
Ohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough?
Till it's to late, it's not too late

[Verse 2]
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying

[Verse 2]
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll no one on the line, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
Yeah, mmm

[Bridge]
You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?
You never know a good thing till it's gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying"
Never Gonna Be AloneNickelback,"[Verse 1]
Time is going by so much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you
Now I'm wondering why I've kept this bottled inside
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know

[Chorus]
You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
You're never gonna be alone
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

[Verse 2]
And now as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands
'Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know

[Chorus]
You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on
We’re gonna take the world on
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

[Verse 3]
Oh!
You've gotta live every single day
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun
Every single day
Maybe our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Tomorrow never comes

[Bridge]
Time is going by so much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you

[Chorus]
You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on
We’re gonna take the world on
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

I'm gonna be there always
I won't be missing one more day
I'm gonna be there always
I won't be missing one more day"

Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster

Callin' like a collector, sorry, I cannot answer

[Verse 4: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé, both]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party

Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

Heaven Can WaitWE the Kings,"Here's a song
For the nights
I think too much and
Here's a song
When I imagine us together
Here's a song
For when we talk too much
And I forget my words

Heaven can wait up high in the sky
It's you and I
Heaven can wait deep down in your eyes
I'm yours tonight
Lay your heart next to mine
I feel so alive
Tell me you want me to stay forever
'Cause heaven can wait

Here's a song
For the one who stole my heart
And ran so far
That Cupid couldn't catch her
Here's a song
For the kid who aimed so high
He shot her down

Heaven can wait up high in the sky
It's you and I
Heaven can wait deep down in your eyes
I'm yours tonight
Lay your heart next to mine
I feel so alive
Tell me you want me to stay forever
'Cause heaven can wait

Here's a song for the nights
I drink too much and spill my words

Heaven can wait up high in the sky
It's you and I
Heaven can wait deep down in your eyes
I'm yours tonight
Lay your heart next to mine
I feel so alive
Tell me you want me to stay forever
'Cause heaven can wait
'Cause heaven can wait
'Cause heaven can wait"
Life After YouDaughtry,"[Verse 1]
Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong, but you already know

[Chorus 1]
Believe me, I won't stop at nothin'
To see you, so I've started runnin'

[Chorus 2]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

[Verse 2]
Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time

[Chorus 1]
Oh, why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

[Chorus 2]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

[Bridge]
You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

[Chorus 1]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you, God knows what I'd do, yeah

[Chorus 2]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through, yeah
Know there's no life after you

Know there's no life after you (know there's no life after you)
Know there's no life after you (know there's no life after you)
Know there's no life after you (know there's no life after you)
Know there's no life after you, yeah"

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

On the table, screamin'
""Fuck the other side! They're jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas

They should throw their hand in

So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels.""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels.""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

RainCreed,"[Verse 1]
Can you help me out, can you lend me a hand?
It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light
I just can't figure out, how to make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more, something more

[Chorus]
I feel it's going to rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
With every tomorrow comes another life
I feel it's going to rain, for days and days
(I feel it's going to rain)

[Verse 2]
I tried to figure out, I can't understand
What it means to be whole again
Trapped between the truth and the consequence
Nothing's real, nothing's making sense

[Pre-Chorus]
A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more, something more

[Chorus]
I feel it's going to rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this, rain like this, rain like this

[Bridge]
Fall down, wash away my yesterdays
Fall down, so let the rain fall down on me

I feel it's going to rain like this for days

Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

[Refrain: Lloyd]
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)"

Baby pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, there's just one thang that I gotta know

I can make this show stop, soon as he hear this fo' pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A-N all the way down to yo' block
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla)
And the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate)
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces

Befo' you make it big, well, there's just one thang that I gotta know

""Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything that night
I don't know, I just miss you so much
Can you call me back?""

[Verse 1: Hillary Scott]
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Antebellum & Charles Kelley]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Whoa, oh

[Bridge: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]
I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

[Chorus: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley & Lady Antebellum]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

I just need you now
Oh baby, I need you now"
Heartbreak WarfareJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1]
Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

Verse [2]
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

[Verse 3]
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all

[Bridge]
It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God, we're going to get it right
If you lay your weapon down

[Chorus]
Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak

[Outro]
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare"

Heyy
Heeey
Heey

[Verse 1]
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you
Blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you
In every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister

Single thing you do, tonight

Heyy
Heeey
Heey

[Verse 2]
Just in time
I'm so glad you have
A one track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection
We can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out
My untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna
Blow your mind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a
Single thing you do, tonight

Way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

Ain't that Mr. Mister

The way you move ain't fair, you know

Today Was A FairytaleTaylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

Come here right now
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me

Vanilla TwilightOwl City,"[Verse 1]
The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you dear
'Cause I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers are
Right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone

[Bridge]
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
As many times as I blink, I'll think of you tonight
I'll think of you tonight

[Verse 3]
When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh, if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your ear
""Oh darling, I wish you were here"""
Halfway GoneLifehouse,"[Verse 1]
Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
You were always hard to hold
So letting go ain't easy
I'm hanging on but growing cold
While my mind is leaving

[Chorus]
Talk, talk is cheap
Give me your word you can keep
Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone

[Verse 2]
You got one foot out the door
And choking on the other
Always think there's something more
Is just around the corner

[Chorus]
Talk, talk is cheap
Give me your word you can keep
Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone

[Bridge]
If you want me out, then I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, I'm feeling this way

[Chorus]
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Now I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone

[Outro]
Don't take too long, don't take too long
Because I'm on my way, if you take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on way
And I'm feeling, feeling, I'm feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
If you want me out, then I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, I'm feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone [3x]"
SomedayRob Thomas,"[Verse 1]
You can go
You can start all over again
You can try to find a way to make another day go by
You can hide
Hold all your feelings inside
You can try to carry on when all you wanna do is cry

[Chorus]
And maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
Try to put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to make things better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

[Verse 2]
Now we wait
And try to find another mistake
If you throw it all away, then maybe you can change your mind
You can run
And when everything is over and done
You can shine a little light on everything around you
Man, it’s good to be someone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna wait
I just wanna know
I just wanna hear you tell me so
Give it to me straight
Tell it to me slow

[Chorus 2]
‘Cause maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
We’ll put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to just to feel better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

[Outro x2]
‘Cause sometimes we don’t really notice
Just how good it can get
So maybe we should start all over
Start all over, again"

You was the beat onto my top line
Put us together and you have to hit the rewind
See, you give me a purpose, now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again
Oh, when we were burning up the airwaves
They knew us from the Virgin Islands to the U.K
See, we was on our way to the platinum and gold
Never thought that you'd go, but you did, yeah
Yeah, you did

Nothin' On YouB.o.B,"[Chorus 1: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say hi
And I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well now you know

Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at
Girl you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane
Or a car or a train
No other girl's in my brain
And you the one to blame

BulletproofLa Roux,"[Verse 1]
Been there, done that, messed around
I’m having fun, don’t put me down
I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won’t let you in again
The messages I’ve tried to send
My information’s just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I’m not turned on to love until it’s cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I’m having fun, don’t put me down
I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet

[Chorus]
This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof

[Verse 2]
I won’t let you turn around
And tell me now I’m much too proud
To walk away from something when it’s dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There’s certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life’s too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won’t let you turn around
And tell me now I’m much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof

Sometimes I lay under the moon and thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray, ""Don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for a reason""

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around, because...

[Chorus]
All my life I've been waiting for, I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more, there'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh)

[Verse 2]
It's not about win or lose, 'cause we all lose when they feed
On the souls of the innocent, blood-drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging
In this maze, you can lose your way (Your way)
It might drive you crazy, but don't let it phase you, no way (No way)

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown)
But I never let it get me down (Get me dow-own)

One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh, one day)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh)

[Bridge]
One day this all will change, treat people the same
Stop with the violence, down with the hate
One day we'll all be free, and proud to be
Under the same sun, singing songs of freedom like:

Why-ohhh, why-ohh-ohh-ohh

I'm AwesomeSpose,"[Intro: Spose and Cam Groves]
Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome
I don't necessarily have to be here for this
Can I...
I'm gonna keep the headphones though

[Chorus: Spose]
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
No you're not, dude, don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voice mail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall

[Verse 1: Spose]
You know my pants sag low (low)
Even though (though) that went out of style
Like ten years ago (go)
Spose, I got the swagger of a cripple
I got little biceps
Getting fatter in the middle
And lyrically I'm not the best
Physically the opposite of Randy Moss, and yet
So preposterous
Feel the awesomeness
The most obnoxious guest up at the sausage fest
Oh yes
The girls are repulsed
So I hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult
I'm as nervous as my cat, ol' Dirty Curtis
All my writtens are bitten and
All my verses are purchased
Me? I'll never date an actress
Got too many back zits
Plus, my whole home aroma is cat piss
Every show I do is poorly promoted
And if you like this
It's cause my little sister wrote it

[Chorus: Spose]
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude, don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voicemail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall

[Scratching]
The swagger of a cripple

[Verse 2: Spose]
Check it out
I'm from Maine and I don't hunt (nope)
And I can't ski
Smoke weed but I can't roll blunts
Find me whipped by my wifey
My neck not icy
Eatin' at McDonald's because Subway's pricey
Ha, and my uni-brow is plucked
Just asked my mom if I could borrow ten bucks
She's like, ""For what?
Blunt wraps and some Heinekens?
You skinny prick, go get a gym membership and vitamins!""
I'm like, ""Mom please, don't blame it on me
I got my bad habits from you, Dad, and Aunt Steve.""
My attitude's sour but my futon's sweet
And the hair on my ass, it is Jumanji
Suit un-tailored, ringtone Taylor Swift
Can't tweet up on my Twitter
'Cause I haven't done shit
Bank account red, body ungroomed
The only good thing about me is I'm off stage soon

[Chorus: Spose]
I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl

I'm awesome

Suit untailored, ringtone Taylor Swift

[Verse 3: Spose]
Furthermore I am cornier than Ethanol
Cheesier than Provolone
I spent ages eight to ten living in a motorhome
With a ego the size of Tim Duncan
Even though I got shit for brains like a blumpkin
I'm twenty-four, serving lobster rolls
Because I spent a decade filling Optimos
And I'm not even the bomb in Maine
On my game, I'm only about as sexy as John McCain
Now put your hands up
If you have nightmares
If you wouldn't man up if there was a fight here
If you got dandruff
If you drink light beer
I'm outta breath

[Chorus: Spose]
But I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride

And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!

Young ForeverJay-Z + Mr. Hudson,"[Intro: Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young"

All I Ever WantedKelly Clarkson,"[Verse 1]
Tear up the photographs
But yesterday won't let go
Every day, every day, every minute
Here comes the emptiness
Just can't leave lonely alone
Every day, every day, hey hey
This second chancin's really gettin' me down
You've give and taken everything I dreamed about
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in between to escape this desperate scene
Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby, 'cause all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you

[Verse 2]
I'd rather walk alone
Don't wanna chase you around
Every day, every day, every minute
I'd fall a thousand times
Before I let you drag me down
Every day, every day, hey, hey
Your new beginning was a perfect ending
But I keep feeling we've already been here before
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in between to escape this desperate scene
Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby, 'cause all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you

[Bridge]
Tell me, with so many out there, why I always turn to you
Your goodbyes tear me down every time
And it's so easy to see
That the blame is on me

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in between to escape this desperate scene
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted (All I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
Was an in between to escape this desperate scene
Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby, 'cause all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you"
Your Love Is My DrugKe$ha,"[Verse 1]
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hitting my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Verse 2]
Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Bridge]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

[Verse 3]
Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug? Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug?

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Hey, so...
Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug

Nothing to lose

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'mma have my own theme music

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)

The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)

Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)

This AfternoonNickelback,"[Intro]
{Inaudible Chatter}

[Verse 1]
Ohh!
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Verse 2]
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Bridge 1]
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again

[Bridge 2]
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again

[Outro]
Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
{Laughter}
Sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
(Last call, you sons of bitches!)
Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

Haven't Met You YetMichael Buble,"[Verse 1]
I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up then I let myself down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

[Chorus]
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

[Verse 2]
I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

[Chorus]
And somehow I know that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

[Bridge]
They say all’s fair in love and war
But I won’t need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united

[Chorus]
And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

[Bridge]
And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get, than I get, than I get, than I get

[Chorus]
Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid to give so much more than I get yeah
I just haven't met you yet

[Outro]
I just haven't met you yet
Oh promise you kid to give so much more than I get
I said love love love love love love love
I just haven't met you yet
Yeah, I just haven't met you yet"
ImpossibleShontelle,"[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, when all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, Impossible

[Verse 2]
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, when all is gone, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, Impossible (Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, impossible
(Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now (Yeah)
Shout it from the rooftops (Shout it from the rooftops)
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now (Hey)
Tell them I was happy (Tell them I was happy)
And my heart is broken (And my heart is broken)
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be (Whoa)
Impossible, impossible (Impossible, impossible)
Impossible, impossible (Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible (Said let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love

AirplanesB.o.B,"[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro: B.o.B]
I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now"

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach

I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out

For you I'd write a symphony

Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, whoa oh
Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine

Cooler Than MeMike Posner,"[Hook: Mike Posner]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain
You probably think that this song is about you, don't you?

For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy

Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me, but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man, understand

If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell

If you can understand this, we can make some magic
I'm wrong like that

Well, I'm not a trick you play

I'm wakin, up in the morning
Hustlin to the stage, if I've been performin
Bustlin through the hay and bustin the door in
Lately nothin messes up my step and scorin
And speakin of the Misses, I'm watchin 'em pour in (uh)
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin
And don't mean bottles, you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin, feelin like Jordan

[Break - Justin Timberlake]

On the top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again

On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

You know you lookin at winner, winner, winner
`Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

That's right, you see the, Porsche Panamera, got 'em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turnin corners, burnin rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof, I don't run to money, money run to me
In this economy, guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugattis, Maseratis, new Ferraris, I got one of each
My future bright, tight like the pussy out in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die at the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best, no Auto-Tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as a old Cadillac (*laughing*)

Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream

[Verse 2 - Demi Lovato]
Do you remember the nights we
Made our way dreaming
Hoping of being someone big?
We were so young then
We were too crazy in love

[Chorus]

[Chorus - Demi Lovato]

When the lights go out
(And when the lights go out)
We'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream"
Not AfraidEminem,"[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I’m so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

Hey-hey, I can't forget you, baby

I tried to masquerade the pain
That's why I'm next to the booth
D-d-d-dance to the groove
But, but there is no, there is no (Just no gettin' over you)
Baby, it feels so right
To dance to the beat of night
That heat between you and I
Freak, freak to the morning light
We like to live life fast
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no, there is no (Just no gettin' over you)

[Chorus: LMFAO]
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party

[Bridge: Fergie]
People in the place
If you've ever felt love
Then you know, yeah, you know
What I'm talkin' about
There's no gettin' over

[Chorus: LMFAO]
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And part and party
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And party and party"

My first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist

[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
I said no more teachers and no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers, hoping that nobody looks
Lips like liquorice, tongue like candy
Excuse me miss, but can I get you out your panties?

[Pre-Chorus: Nathaniel Motte]
In the back of the car, on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs with my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch

Kisses like whiskey, it gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning with the taste of your tongue

[Pre-Chorus: Nathaniel Motte]

The Only ExceptionParamore,"[Verse 1]
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't, let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

[Chorus]
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing"

Kissin UMiranda Cosgrove,"[Verse 1]
Sparks fly, it's like electricity
I might die when I forget how to breathe
You get closer, and there's nowhere in this world I'd rather be
Time stops, like everything around me is frozen
And nothing matters but these few moments
When you open my mind to things I've never seen

[Chorus]
'Cause when I’m kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I’ve been tryna find
Falls right into place, you’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I’m kissin' you
When I’m kissin' you, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I’ve been askin' in my head
Like, ""Are you the one? Should I really trust?""
Crystal clear, it becomes when I’m kissin' you

[Verse 2]
Past loves, they never got very far
Walls up, make sure I guarded my heart
And I promised I wouldn't do this
'Til I knew it was right for me
But no one (No one)
No guy that I've met before
Could make me (Make me) feel so right and secure
And have you noticed I lose my focus
And the world around me disappears?

[Chorus]
'Cause when I’m kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I’ve been tryna find
Falls right into place, you’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I’m kissin' you
When I’m kissin' u, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I’ve been askin' in my head
Like, ""Are you the one? Should I really trust?""
Crystal clear, it becomes when I’m kissin' you

[Bridge]
I've never felt nothing like this
You're making me open up
No point even tryin' to fight this
It kinda feels like it's love

[Chorus]
'Cause when I’m kissin' you, my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I’ve been tryna find
Falls right into place, you’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I’m kissin' you
When I’m kissin' you, it all starts makin' sense
And all the questions I’ve been askin' in my head
Like, ""Are you the one? Should I really trust?""
Crystal clear, it becomes when I’m kissin' you"

You Look Better When I'm DrunkThe White Tie Affair,"You look better when I'm drunk
You look better
You look better when I'm drunk

To make the wrong moves gotta
Bad case and nothing to lose
When the
Lights out we have an excuse
Is this romance
Or is it the juice?

I might be crazy but I think
Tonight has only begun (gun, gun)
Your not my normal type
But we can make an exception (on, on)

A little less thinkin' and a lot more drikin
That'll work for me tonight (oh, oh)

Wait for the buzz to kick in

I might be crazy but I think
Tonight has already done (done, done)
Your not my normal type
But we can make an exception (on, on)

A little less thinkin' and a lot more drikin
That'll work for me tonight (oh, oh)
When the room starts spinnin'
And we start sinnin'
I begin to realize

You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better... Drunk
You look better... Drunk
You look better when I'm
Drunk-drunk-drunk-drunk

Hey dj spin the soundtrack
To bad decisions
And these drinks, make me
Lose my self control
Hey dj spin the soundtrack
To bad decisions
And these drinks, make me
Lose my self control

(That's why)

You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better when I'm drunk
You look better... Drunk
You look better... Drunk
You look better when I'm

The Perfect MistakeCartel,"[Verse 1:]
Wake me up, I’ve been dreaming
It feels just like any other day-
I sit you down, here goes nothing
And you’re not gonna like what I say
Get out, oh just get out

[Chorus:]
“Get Up, Get Out”
That’s what she said, “You drive me crazy.”
“I can’t believe that’s what you did.”
“And don’t call me baby.”
And I know I’m wrong, I knew all along that you’d find out
I’m the perfect mistake, I’m hoping you’ll make right now

[Verse 2:]
Wake me up, I’ve been dreaming
Because I haven’t heard from you in days
Hazy now, this fog just follows me around
And it’s only you that burns it away
So get out, oh just get out

[Chorus:]
“Get Up, Get Out”
That’s what she said, “You drive me crazy.”
“I can’t believe that’s what you did.”
“And don’t call me baby.”
And I know I’m wrong, I knew all along that you’d find out
I’m the perfect mistake, I’m hoping you’ll make right now

[Bridge:]
I see your face, every time I close my eyes
Its getting worse you say, it comes as no surprise

Why am I hell bent on losing, when I can’t get you out of my head?

[Chorus:]
“Get Up, Get Out”
That’s what she said, “You drive me crazy.”
“I can’t believe that’s what you did.”
“And don’t call me baby.”
And I know I’m wrong, I knew all along that you’d find out
I’m the perfect mistake, I’m hoping you’ll make right now

[Outro]
Oh I’m the perfect mistake, I’m hoping you’ll make right now-
Oh you’ll make right now"
Love The Way You LieEminem,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"
MiseryMaroon 5,"[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

[Post Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Verse 2]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus]

You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

[Bridge]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam

[Refrain]
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

Uh, uh, yo, he the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S-s-s' on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S-s-s' on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon
""Konvict"" just like Akon

If I Had YouAdam Lambert,"[Verse 1]
So I got my boots on, got the right amount of leather
And I'm doin' me up with a black color liner
And I'm working my strut, but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love

There's a thin line 'tween the dark side
And the light side, baby, tonight
It's a struggle, gotta rumble, tryna find it

Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rollin' in Maserati's

The Man Who Can't Be MovedThe Script,"[Verse 1]
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying ""If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?""
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

[Chorus]
'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

[Verse 2]
Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here""
I say, ""There's someone I'm waiting for
If it's a day, a month, a year""
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go

[Chorus]
'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving

People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh
There are no holes in his shoes
But a big hole in his world, yeah
Maybe I'll get famous
As the man who can't be moved
And maybe you won't mean to
But you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

[Chorus]
'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me (find you're missing me)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (oh, where on Earth I could be)
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet, oh, oh)
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street (on the corner of the street)

SecretsOneRepublic,"[Verse 1]
I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess
'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

[Chorus]
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And every day I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no

So tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears

Can't even hang out with friends
Without ya blowin' up my phone
Why you all in my ear
Like where am I?
And when am I coming home?

Why you listening to your friends?
They don't wanna see us be
Boy, you better take it slow
Or I'll be history

[Pre-Chorus:]
You've got to give me my space
So quick to calling my name
Boy, you better recognize
My love is one of a kind

You drive me up to the ceiling
Boy, there's no need for the screaming
You know that you are my world
But I'm sick and tired of the

Half Of My HeartJohn Mayer,"[Verse 1: John Mayer]
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 2: John Mayer]
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 3: John Mayer]
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

[Backup Vocals: Taylor Swift]
I can't stop loving you

But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

[Chorus 2: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do

[Outro: John Mayer ]
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart"
If It's LoveTrain,"[Verse 1]
While everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger
I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life
But I'm afraid when I hear stories
About husband and wife
There's no happy endings
No Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

[Verse 2]
Took a loan on a house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I want to buy ya everything
Except cologne
'Cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain
Where the rain falls mainly on the plain
Sounds insane
Because it is, we can laugh, we can sing
Have ten kids and give them everything
Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad that we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

[Verse 3]
You can move in
I won't ask where you've been
Because everybody has a past
When we're older
We'll do it all over again
When everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it for you

[Bridge]
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
Then the rest is just whatever

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me"
Teenage DreamKaty Perry,"[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

I feel like I'm drowning in ice water
My lips have turned a shade of blue
I'm frozen with this fear, that you may disappear
Before I've given you the truth

I bleed my heart out on this paper for you
So you can see what I can't say
I'm dying here (dying here)
'Cause I can't say what I want to
I bleed my heart out just for you

I've always dreamed about this moment
And now it's here and I've turned to stone
I stand here petrified, as I look in your eyes
My head is ready to explode

I bleed my heart out on this paper for you
So you can see what I can't say
I'm dying here
'Cause I can't say what I want to
I bleed my heart out just for you

For all the times those words were never said

Which means I downgraded to a human being
You was born a Goddess, I made you my queen
Which mean we upgraded to Louis the thirteen
Hot tottie, her poppy like Cognac
Her momma like herb tea, we birthed a couple of sacks
And as the tea steeped, I creeped all in her tee-pee
We did it Indian style, had the girls speaking

Stop it, before you wake up my mom, I might (ah)
And now that you arrived, it’s time that I go
I'm so cold, I'm so cold

If you are the one
Then us meeting here is fate, uh
Future with a dog named Ben
Buy a house with a fireplace
This is the first I've seen your face
But there's a chance we are soulmates
I know that this might sound crazy
'Cause you don't know my name

But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know

With the perfect diamond ring (perfect diamond ring)
We just met, but if you say, ""Yes""
We'd have our wedding on the beach (oh)
It could happen, raise three kids
And we grow old, oh, so happily
I know this may sound crazy
'Cause I don't know your name

Need YouTravie McCoy,"[Verse 1]
I know it's not your fault, but I’m a locked door
And inside, I'm a mess by someone before
And I wish that I, I could find a key
To unlock all the things you want us to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me open up and start again
But there’s a safe around my heart
I don’t know how to let you in
And that’s what keeps us apart

[Chorus]
And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you
I need you to understand, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Call up the locksmith
Tell him we need him quick
We’ve got a million keys
None of them seem to fit
While you’re on the phone
Call up the clocksmith
'Cause I could use some time
Even the slightest bit

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me open up and start again
And break this safe around my heart
I don’t know how to let you in
And that’s what keeps us apart

[Chorus]
And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you
I need you to understand

[Bridge]
I’m thinking now's the time
Maybe it's time to go
If I gave you my heart, be gentle
I’m tired of laying low, let's give the world a show
And when you know, you know
And when you know, you know, you know
And when you know, you know, you know, you know

And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you

Like It's Her BirthdayGood Charlotte,"[Verse 1]
Tonight I kinda get the feeling my girl is up to something
Something that is no good
She said she only had a meeting but she is dressed for something
Something that is no good
Now I'm not saying that she's cheating, but seeing is believing
Can't believe it what I'm seeing when I stepped inside

[Chorus]
She's so wasted, acting crazy
Making a scene, like it's her birthday
Drinking champagne, going insane
Falling on me, like it's her birthday
This ain't the night I thought it'd be
And she ain't shy, apparently
Cause she's in the crowd and everybody sings
Like it's her birthday

[Verse 2]
She turns and says don't be surprised, it's going to be a good night
A good, good night
She's showing me a different side, one I've never seen before
That I ignore
Cause when I'm up she's all about me
When I'm down she stays around me
Now I know I'm one and only
So I might as well enjoy the ride

[Chorus]
She's so wasted, acting crazy
Making a scene, like it's her birthday
Drinking champagne, going insane
Falling on me, like it's her birthday
This ain't the night I thought it'd be
And she ain't shy, apparently
Cause she's in the crowd and everybody sings
Like it's her birthday
Like it's her birthday
Like it's her birthday
Like it's her birthday
Like it's her birthday

She's so wasted, acting crazy
Making a scene, like it's her birthday
Drinking champagne, going insane
Falling on me, like it's her birthday
This ain't the night I thought it'd be
And she ain't shy, apparently
Cause she's in the crowd and everybody sings
Like it's her birthday"
